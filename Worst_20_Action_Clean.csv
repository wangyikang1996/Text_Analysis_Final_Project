1,Sadak 2 (2020),1.1,Mahesh Bhatt,I started this movie because I was very curious to see if there is any thing good in this movie. i could not tolerate this movie beyond 20 minutes. So I would not be able to write too much about this movie. Lot of people say say Sadak was good movie but very few are aware that Sadak was copy of hit hollywood movie Taxi Driver. My advice would be not to waste your two hours and skip this movie.
2,Sadak 2 (2020),1.1,Mahesh Bhatt,"This is a total ridiculous movie with a worst plot and there wasn't even a minute that this movie could be enjoyed. No story, no character development nothing whatsoever.

The only plus point about this movie was it's soundtrack which was decent enough. My suggestion would be to skip this movie and rewatch some other comedy or drama movie..

My Rating : 0.5/5"
3,Sadak 2 (2020),1.1,Mahesh Bhatt,"Movie said to be sequel have no connection from first part , it's just a ploy to grab eyeball , story is nt clear and screenplay is uneven , mahesh bhatt returned to direction after 21 years to give such a disaster, Alia bhatt hamming in every scene Sanjay dutt doesn't look interested Aditya roy kapur is wasted he is no where in second half I think bhatt have lost their touch in past few years It will add up to their flop list

Better give it miss their many better stuff available on ott"
4,Sadak 2 (2020),1.1,Mahesh Bhatt,"Understand philosophically, Sadak 2 is the story of two broken characters coming together, who spiritually and mentally support each other.

The story is straightforward, but the screenplay has been so entangled that for some time one does not understand where the film is going.

The initial scenes of Sanjay Dutt and Aaliya confuse. However, later the picture starts to clear. However, by then the film is bored and runs on a very worn-out pattern.

sadak 2 movie review The writing of Pushpdeep Bhardwaj, Suhrata Sengupta, and Mahesh Bhatt was very weak. Dialogues are ineffective and outdated.

Even after half the film, nothing happens in the film. The film's villain changes with just a lot of twist and every twist that will haunt you after some time.

Arriving at Climax, the entire film piles up like a castle of cards. And you will never be disappointed with a film.

After the completion of 'Sadak 2' for about two and a half hours, the idea is that this is 'SadakChhap'.

The main character of the film is two - Alia Bhatt and Sanjay Dutt. Both have tried their best to portray their characters well.

But in some scenes where Sanjay Dutt is seen holding the character too much, Alia is seen leaving her character.

Aditya Roy Kapur done his parts as he could.

Talking about the supporting side, the best actors like Gulshan Grover, Mohan Kapoor were dealt cheaply.

The trailer of the film suggested that in the role of Baba, Makrand Deshpande would create an impact like Sadashiv Amrapurkar, who became the street queen, but his character was in fear Instead creates a sense of humor.

If any artist leaves an impact in the film, he is Jishu Sengupta. Jishu has played a negative role in the film and made scenes with his performance.

There is a balance in his acting. Actually, Jishu's character brings an exciting twist to the Sadak 2 story.

Mahesh Bhatt has come in 2020 with Sadak Part 2 and through which he has ended his exile under direction. However, this comeback is extremely disappointing and sad given Mahesh Bhatt's illustrious legacy.

To prove the film a sequel, an attempt has been made to randomly link the road.

For this, the street flashback scenes have been used so much in the film that you will feel bored. Pooja Bhatt is present only in scenes from her first film in the film.

This film is a high faded dish. You will enjoy everything while window shopping, but in the trial room you will just leave disappointed. So, if you believe us, you can leave this film comfortably."
5,Sadak 2 (2020),1.1,Mahesh Bhatt,"The real pandemic is watching Sadak 2. Storyline, Screenplay everything is so Disappointing. Pain in the head. Even actors in this film have failed to impress."
6,Sadak 2 (2020),1.1,Mahesh Bhatt,"Waste ! Waste ! Total Waste !! Aditya should act in better story movies otherwise quit acting. Alia is bad, Overacting on peak. Rajmouli garu should throw her out of RRR Jissu and Sanjay dutt are wasted."
7,Sadak 2 (2020),1.1,Mahesh Bhatt,"#FinalVerdict

The first question that crosses your mind after having watched Sadak 2 is, for whom has director Mahesh Bhatt made this film? Is it for the Indian audience - the upper strata, the commoners, the hoi polloi? Or is it targetted at the international audience?

Sadak 2 is neither novel nor experimental. It falls flat on its face! While bits and pieces of the first half are somewhat watchable, the film goes completely awry in its post-interval portions. A disaster of epic proportion! Seriously, what was Mahesh Bhatt and Suhrita Sengupta thinking while penning this apology of a script? Strangely, director Mahesh Bhatt's style is abstract this time around, which fails to catch the viewer's fancy. He seems completely clueless.

To sum up, there are good films and there are bad films. Sadak 2 is neither good nor bad. It's just excruciatingly boring! In addition, there are too many coincidences all through, which totally seem unreal and unbelievable. Sadak 2 is over two hours of complete drivel."
8,Sadak 2 (2020),1.1,Mahesh Bhatt,Just rubbish and third class movie. Acting is so poor and predictable. Waste of time and money.

11,Sadak 2 (2020),1.1,Mahesh Bhatt,"My question to mr Bhatt is WHY u have made this movie

At the end of this movie you will ask your self WHY I saw this movie"

24,Sadak 2 (2020),1.1,Mahesh Bhatt,"I tried to keep an objective perspective on this movie and the trailer really disappointed me but the film overall was so painful to sit through.

Sadak 2 shows Ravi mourning his dead wife but soon finds purpose in life after meeting Aryaa.

With all the controversy surrounding the Bollywood film industry, I try to stay honest and objective towards every film I see and believe me when I say, Sadak 2 is the WORST film I've seen in 2020 so far and its issues lie in its outdated script. This film didn't even need to be called Sadak 2 as it barely adds anything to the first film. I even tried to watch this as a comedy and there were some funny moments but so much of it was boring that I wanted it to end as soon as possible. If this came out in 90s, it would have probably worked as I don't think I've seen something so outdated in a long time.

The story is fairly predictable but Mahesh Bhatt and Suhrita Sengupta add a few twists along the way. These twists come out of nowhere and there is zero build up for any of them. I cannot forget to mention how bad the villains were. They're so poorly developed and underutilised. Mahesh Bhatt could've told this story in a non-linear fashion which would have enhanced the story and characters in some way but this film takes none of those options. It decides to reveal everyone's backstory in the most uncreative and lazy way: exposition. Its storytelling methods tell me nothing about Mahesh Bhatt's skill as a director. There are no risks taken to present a bland story like this in an unconventional and original way. It's told in the most basic way possible.

The song placements were so obnoxious. When stakes began to rise, for some reason a song would be played right after it. Not only is it tonally inconsistent but it relieves any tension the film may have built up. Then there were little things which got on my nerves. There's this scene where Jisshu Sengupta plays a voice message of Alia Bhatt and before she speaks, the message is already halfway done but then she speaks for around two minutes which makes no sense. This shows the lack of care and effort that went into making Sadak 2. The film tries to spread the message of how God has turned into a business where the vulnerable are being taken advantage of and how you can find purpose in life after dealing with a loss but none of these are explored in greater detail.

I liked Sanjay Dutt's performance here even though he had little to work with. Alia Bhatt is one of the best actresses working today and did an okay job. There are other films where I feel she gave a more memorable performance. Aditya Roy Kapur is completely wasted here. Jisshu Sengupta tries but the material he had to work with was so bad.

There are quite a few scenes that are unintentionally funny. I honestly couldn't take Makrand Deshpande's character seriously and some scenes with Alia Bhatt shouting and a scene involving an owl were quite funny. However, there is no point watching Sadak 2. Nothing about it is remotely enjoyable or special. It's a very forgettable film and one I won't ever see again."

Same old bollywood drama, we all grew up watching. This film offers nothing more. The acting is below average, the dialogs doesn't fit the scene or characters. The attempt to make another fake baba villain is plain boring. The audience is right, that we should not expect much when nepotism is preferred over talent by these bollywood directors. It was painful to give even 1 star to this movi"
31,Sadak 2 (2020),1.1,Mahesh Bhatt,"This film is absolutely Garbage. No story, Overacting, lack of direction, build up, unnecessary songs and just ghastly old concepts that were not given enough time to be explored.

If Mahesh Bhatt used his brain he would have used this boring story and created something more interesting by perhaps changing the sequences of the story, making it perhaps non-linear... and may be the story could have been slightly more appealing.

38,Sadak 2 (2020),1.1,Mahesh Bhatt,"It is incredible that this movie was even made. The producers of the film should be have taken pity on the people under lockdown and not released it.

The story is terrible, screenplay horrendous and the acting is downright poor. Most of the dialogue in the film can be simply defined as ""ghisa pita"".

Whenever the plot, rises ever so slightly , to sprout some interest, the filmmaker destroys that potential without delay.

The viewer is confused about the tone of the film. Is it supposed to be dark? Serious? Parody? Are the actors acting the way they are, because they have been instructed to sabotage the film ?

The music is forgettable. Sets, art and production designers have painted a migraine on screen. The Make up is farcical.

The list is endless. I can't go on. But I think you catch the drift.

To those whose curiosity is still not satiated, can of course watch the movie. It will offer a lot of moments when you would wonder why you are watching it."

I just feel bad for my favorite Sanju Bawa, this movie is one of the poorest life choices he has ever had to make (including possession of drugs and weapons). Bollywood needs to make better effort, especially when there are plethora of movies and series being released via OTT.

Alia tried her best, so did Sanjay Dutt. Not sure what Aditya is doing in this movie. Supporting cast can be seen struggling hard to put life to boring characters.

200,Race 3 (2018),1.9,Remo D'Souza (as Remo),"Even the mountain dew ad had better graphics than this piece of junk! On a scale of 1 to 10, it'll be 0!"
201,Race 3 (2018),1.9,Remo D'Souza (as Remo),The Movie is absolute trash..only idiot salman khan fans will rate it above 5.
202,Race 3 (2018),1.9,Remo D'Souza (as Remo),"While films like Parmanu, Padmavati, Padman, Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety , 102 Not Out, Hichki or even Blackmail were treat to eyes in the first half of 2018 giving hope that Bollywood movies have matured but then there comes a crap like Race 3 that will spoil your mood and you will wonder that if the makers are taking the audience for granted.

Race 3 tells the story of a dispute between a family when Shamsher Singh (Anil Kapoor) decides to give half of his wealth to the adopted son, Sikander Singh (Salman Khan) and the rest of it between his own kids, Suraj (Saqeeb Saleem) and Sanjana (Daisy Shah).

Directed by Remo D'Souza, who has made a decent film ABCD and pathetic ones like A Flying Jatt and ABCD 2, Race 3 is one hell of a journey which you wish to forget once you leave the theater. Right from the opening scene of the film to the climax, forget about logic, even the story is full of potholes. There is some breath of air when Anil Kapoor tells about his plan but again the film goes back to the loop hole and sadly does not recover. The first film Race (2008) was brilliant with solid twist and turns followed by an average Race 2 (2016). Race 3 is a nightmare which you should get over immediately with as it will haunt you, the more you think about it.

None of songs are good (surprisingly music is composed by brilliant duo Salim - Sulaiman). Action scenes , though few scenes were fine, but again gone overboard. Race 3 is high on production values and less on content. Dialogues are horrible and funny especially - Our business is our business , none of your business. Even the Bhojpuri language used in between the scenes is irritating.

Coming to the performances, none of the actors have done justice to their role. I do not understand why Salman Khan is repeating himself, even though he is in Bollywood industry for more than 25 years. The actor, who was superb in films like Dabanng and Sultan, should start experimenting with roles. Anil Kapoor is fine but could have been better. Bobby Deol makes a decent comeback but sadly not enough to leave any impact. Lesser spoken about Saqeeb Salim, Daisy Shah and Jacqueline Fernandez, the better.

Overall, Race 3 is an insult to Bollywood. Avoid it any cost."
203,Race 3 (2018),1.9,Remo D'Souza (as Remo),"I don't know what kind of mental conditions these people are suffering from, who are rating this movie 10/10. Why couldn't they just make it simple why this whole addition of crap. Just another crappy amalgamation of the movies which had a better script. I just don't think Salman will make any sensible movies in which he just acts good and doesn't just say mindless dialogues."
204,Race 3 (2018),1.9,Remo D'Souza (as Remo),"Seems like directed by a really poorly skilled freshman's direction project. Salman Khan should now take some rest now. Daisy Shah should stop doing movies. Jacqueline can keep doing masala movies, she looks stunning as always but fails to deliver. Bobby Deol's blank expression is not his fault. Anil Kapoor - Why in this movie?"
205,Race 3 (2018),1.9,Remo D'Souza (as Remo),"I guess the Dabangg days for Sallu are over, did not expected this to be Hit but it was purely below average, and spoils the RACE franchise for all its fans. Thriller : LOL No Action: Extra Ordinary Plot: Whats That? Story: Huh? the only saving grace in Anil Kapoor who is as always good to his role.

This is even bad for those who leave their brains at home to watch movies and the one liners are not worth a comment.

I guess the makers of this movie are a big fan of Vin Diesel as most of the actions are from XXX (Bike) and Fast & Furious esp the ""its all about family"" sheesh... taking about ruining the reputation of a great franchise by imitating it the most unprofessional way.

1.5/ 5 Stars"

210,Race 3 (2018),1.9,Remo D'Souza (as Remo),"First things first... I liked Sultan, Dabangg, Bajrangi Bhaijaan, even TZH and Kick were entertaining. Salman Khan is known for his stardom, fanbase, court cases except acting. Even his flops Jai Ho and Tubelight have crossed 1.1 billion mark at the box office. Race 3 is a movie which has been trolled the most than any other film of Salman or any other actor. Remo D'Souza was a very bad choice for big budget, multi starrer, action franchise. He is better off with dance related movies, A Flying Jatt was perfect lesson for him. Salman's involvement in Race Franchise, Questionable. Without giving any spoilers, and keeping the fact in mind that Race 3 is big budget movie sold to Distributors at very high price is really half baked, slow, illogical, bumpy and jerky roller coaster ride with hight production values. Good Cinematography, but Ayananka Bose had done better work before. Poor VFX, Prime Focus is good VFX company (see Bang Bang). Budget provided for VFX seems marginal. Performance are average. Music is letdown. Dialogues are wasted. Runtime is 159min too long. Too many songs. Even Abbas Mustan couldn't have pulled off this task (read weak script). They should have kept Saif Ali Khan (loyal to Race Franchise)."

215,Race 3 (2018),1.9,Remo D'Souza (as Remo),"We all know that, in late 90s, Salman worked mainly in family films and in late 00s, he did action. And now, when 10s decade is At it's last phase, I feel, Salman Decided to work in a movie which would be an action family movie, so THE LENGENDARY Race 3.

Movie takes the elements of both Races (1 & 2) and HSSH and shows it in the most pathetic and cringeworthy possible.

Elements:

Race: Step-siblings, faking death etc

Race 2: Heist, shades of antagonist

HSSH: Joint family, problems between the siblings

You can say while carving the movie Race, the remaining wastage which was assembled together to make race 2 and the wastage of race 2 was assembled and wastage of HSSH was added to make race 3.

PATHETIC, BORING, MINDLESS, PREDICTABLE AND CRINGWORTHY. These are just few words to honour the movie. Movie had some very pathetic performances, pathetic dialogues, pathetic songs with pathetic lyrics (Heeriye is a good number though) & pathetic storyline. The movie was too slow to be called entertaining, I didn't understand half of the story, no not because it had a very complex and out of the world story, just like that of Nolan's movies, but because I had a good sleep during the movie. Plus songs were so frequent and long that you can't help but sleep, so if you have trouble in sleeping or are insomniac. Please go for Race 3. It was an all and all Salman Khan movie, so I don't need to say how mindless it would be (But movies like tere naam, Saajan and Bajrangi Bhaijaan were way awesome). Twists were too damn predictable, Race series is known for amazing thrills and out of the world twists, but this one had none, yeah the last twist was good, but not amazing as that was also kind of predictable. The dialogues, the songs, the lyrics, the acting, the action scenes... everything about this movie was criminally cringeworthy.

The best thing about the movie was Bobby Deol and Anil Kapoor. Saif Ali Khan is missed badly and so is Abbas-Mastan.

I request Ramesh Taurani, that if he is in a mood to make Race 4, please continue the Race 2 story and bring back Saif. Let Bobby be there, we have no problem.

I've only one suggestion for you guys. There is a plethora of good movies, Avengers Infinity wars is still running in the theatres. Jurassic World is running. And if nothing, than please save your cash for Sanju, rather than watching this masterpiece of mud.

In my honest opinion, movies like Ek tha tiger, PRDP, Khiladi 786 and even loha and Gunda are like citizen Kane, Titanic, Godfather and the Shawshank redemption in front of this movie

Completely avoidable"

Other actor has done just justice with their role. Daisy Shah and Jacqueline Fernandez have done brilliant action sequence than dialogue delivery. **Bobby Deol** has good supporting role. Anil Kapoor was less utilized. Saqib's role was not written well. Freddy has small role like Cameo. **Script:** There was no script at all, only action sequence without any logic and plot. Sometime Action thriller turn into family drama like Prem Ratan Dhan Payo. So many flaws in the story telling. **Action:** Action Sequences and Chase sequences were really breath taking. Fight between Daisy Shah and Jacqueline Fernandez was good one. **Cinematography:** This one is another good thing about Race 3 apart from Action sequences. **Ayananka Bose** has done a terrific camera work. **Music:** Race 3 has worst music of last 10 years of Salman Khan. There are lots of experiment done on music as there are many singers and lyricist for each song. Even Salman Khan has written 2 songs where Lulia has sing those songs as well. **Box-office:** It is expected to earn 30-35 crores on opening day. As word of mouth is negative so it will take 3-4 days to complete 100 crores Box-office collection.

Race 3, an in-name-only third installment of a wildly successful franchise, has me thinking: Who let the filmmakers attach the name to this steaming pile of crap? It's not quite sure what it wants to be. Like a cross between a heavy-handed soap opera, a heist movie, an over-the-top musical extravaganza and a mindless Michael Bay blockbuster, complete with illogical explosions. By the end of the first extended action sequence, I wanted to tap out but I knew I wasn't getting a refund due to the use of MoviePass so I was in it for the long haul.

Clocking in at 160 minutes (standard for an Indian film), we are treated to about a minute of thanks credits before being quickly thrown into the squabbles of this wealthy dysfunctional family, the Singhs. The film gives us a narrative, describing each living member of the family with great detail, as if these characters already existed. It's like watching someone narrate Dallas.

Since almost everyone in the film has more negative qualities than positive, this makes it hard to find someone to relate to. There is one who stands out, Sikander (Salman Khan, who also produces), as a sort of black sheep. Decent performances are given but they're all hindered by the writing, which adds something new on so often one can lose track. I see it as a bizarre parallel to my own work.

I don't have much experience in Indian cinema. Only a few have crossed my path (Dr. Cabbie, Padmaavat and Aiyaary) but this one makes me question the future of my seeking out more. I know there are way better ones out there, and I'll find those.

Visually, the film has a rather blatant abuse of slow motion effects. Even to the smallest of details. This may be due to my lack of viewing but there was a lot of jumping between Hindi and English, and subtitles for both sides. As well as a number of inconsistencies in the translation (some words come out spelled differently, words being capitalized strangely).

Don't get me wrong. I love musicals (I saw The Greatest Showman five times and I embrace all kinds of different selections) but here, the over-the-top flashy theatrical musical numbers felt so out of place and very overlong.

I'll have to seek out some Indian films with repute, and perhaps not go gung ho next time. If there is a Race 4 after this (rumor has it, there will be), I'm afraid I may have to steer clear. 0.5/5."

I think Salman should think before signing any films because these days his films not performing well. And slowly Salman will lose his shine.

When we talk about the storyline, So in one sentence - ""No Story at all"".

Songs were un-understandable. I think after getting the good success of ABCD, Remo think they can do anything. But REMO Sir, it's India, anything can happen at any time.

299,Race 3 (2018),1.9,Remo D'Souza (as Remo),"For your life and sanity! This movie is a nonstop sequence of twists and turns--in, unfortunately, all the wrong ways. This is certainly one of the worst movies I've seen--ever. I'm giving it one star instead of none simply because some of the stunt scenes seem like they had some effort. By the way, the action scenes in this movie may indeed be the worst of any of Salman's ""magic masala"" action flicks. This movie seems more like a trailer than an actual cinematic piece. It's plot is virtually non-existent considering the incessant attempts to just thwart the reader's each and every prediction on what happens next. Remo D'Souza has gone out of control here. Anil Kapoor is a relief to see on screen, but other than that and the occasional eye-catcher, everything else is a blurry, poorly envisioned, excuse for a fusion of Hum Saath Saath Hain and The Fast and the Furious. I will conclude this with a very accurate comment I found on YouTube about this horrendous film. Race 1: Akshaye Khanna gets screwed, Race 2: John Abraham gets screwed, Race 3: Audience gets scre"
300,Race 3 (2018),1.9,Remo D'Souza (as Remo),"While films like Parmanu, Padmavati, Padman, Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety , 102 Not Out, Hichki or even Blackmail were treat to eyes in the first half of 2018 giving hope that Bollywood movies have matured but then there comes a crap like Race 3 that will spoil your mood and you will wonder that if the makers are taking the audience for granted.

Race 3 tells the story of a dispute between a family when Shamsher Singh (Anil Kapoor) decides to give half of his wealth to the adopted son, Sikander Singh (Salman Khan) and the rest of it between his own kids, Suraj (Saqeeb Saleem) and Sanjana (Daisy Shah).

Directed by Remo D'Souza, who has made a decent film ABCD and pathetic ones like A Flying Jatt and ABCD 2, Race 3 is one hell of a journey which you wish to forget once you leave the theater. Right from the opening scene of the film to the climax, forget about logic, even the story is full of potholes. There is some breath of air when Anil Kapoor tells about his plan but again the film goes back to the loop hole and sadly does not recover. The first film Race (2008) was brilliant with solid twist and turns followed by an average Race 2 (2016). Race 3 is a nightmare which you should get over immediately with as it will haunt you, the more you think about it.

None of songs are good (surprisingly music is composed by brilliant duo Salim - Sulaiman). Action scenes , though few scenes were fine, but again gone overboard. Race 3 is high on production values and less on content. Dialogues are horrible and funny especially - Our business is our business , none of your business. Even the Bhojpuri language used in between the scenes is irritating.

Coming to the performances, none of the actors have done justice to their role. I do not understand why Salman Khan is repeating himself, even though he is in Bollywood industry for more than 25 years. The actor, who was superb in films like Dabanng and Sultan, should start experimenting with roles. Anil Kapoor is fine but could have been better. Bobby Deol makes a decent comeback but sadly not enough to leave any impact. Lesser spoken about Saqeeb Salim, Daisy Shah and Jacqueline Fernandez, the better.

Overall, Race 3 is an insult to Bollywood. Avoid it any cost."

329,Race 3 (2018),1.9,Remo D'Souza (as Remo),"It's easy to run alone in the field and win the race, and that's what happens with Salman Khan every year on Eid. I am not a hater of Salman Khan, I am a hater of horrible movies. Tiger Zinda Hai was pretty good, but this one proved to be horrible.

For making a sensible and watchable movie we need a proper storyline (I doubt, whether Race 3 had any) a set of actors who can act (I need a microscope to find one out there) and songs which we could hum for a couple of days (Let's not talk anymore about the songs, because I cannot find a single thing to appreciate about them, I mean, none of them are worth hearing twice).

How can we forget the ""meme - worthy"" dialogues and the ""beautiful"" lyrics written by the megastar Salman Khan?!

""Our business is our business, none of your business"". ""Ik baar baby selfish hoke apne liye jiyo na.""

Now let's talk about the previous two movies of the Race series: -Race was absolutely brilliant, let's say it proves ""Old is Gold"". Race 2 was my favourite. Race is Saif Ali Khan's and it will only be his. Race without Saif, Dabangg without Salman and Dhoom without Hrithik is meaningless. Believe me, save your money. Please don't waste it on Race 3.

Instead, watch Sanju on 29th June. Practically, there is nothing good about this movie except the beautiful cars shown flying. Salman here is a cluless stuntsman. Now, he should realise that stardom does not make a movie, a proper storyline and fine acting makes one.

I would rate this movie 1 out of 10.

Ratings of the songs: -

(1) Heeriye: 1.5 out of 5 (2) Selfish: 0.5 out of 5 (3) Allah Duhaai Hai: 2.5 out of 5 (4) Party Chale On: 0.5 out of 5

Overall: Horrible (1 out of 5)

Rating: -

Direction: 0.5/5 Dialogues: 0.5/5 Screenplay: 0.5/ 5 Music: 1.0 / 5 Action: 2.0 / 5 Visual appeal: 1.5 / 5

Overall: Disaster (1.0 out of 5)

Box office prediction: - (Lifetime) 200 to 220 crores in India because I know that even after saying this much, insensible Salman fans will go and watch this movie and make this crap a blockbuster.

That's my review for Race 3."

Salman's acting (or lack thereof) is blatantly visible in this movie. I think earlier he used to try (at leats), now he doesn't even bother. An actor is supposed to be the character but here, his persona outshines and overshadows the character or even the story. Saqib Salim who is a decent actor made to say the word ""bro"" after each and every dialogue so much so that it becomes cringeworthy. Bobby Deol is average, Daisy, Jacquline are... like they are in their other movies - all glam no skill. Anil Kapoor is the only one who can hold his own.

The plot is contrived (which was true for earlier Race movies too) but this movie doesn't even put any effort. Be it pulling off a supposedly dangerous heist which is wrapped up in a song sequence with the actors just walking in slow motion to look cool. At least some effort should have been shown- some action scene, some nail-biting suspense but we get nothing. All the maker focussed on was getting Salman, getting the other actors to walk in slo-mo to look cool and blowing up expensive cars.

The songs... I don't even know where to begin. I was shocked that a big-budget movie couldn't even afford a decent lyricist till I saw that Salman has penned a couple of the songs himself. Just do a quick google search of Selfish and I found love - 2 ""gems"". Even the title track has been mashed and made bad.

I thought Race 1 was okay, Race 2 was going downhill but still bearable but Race 3 just touches the bottom of it. Non-existent story-lines, bad acting, ""star"" kids etc is what Bollywood has been reduced to now."

It's quite obvious with the fact that Google shows salman Khan as the worst actor not because of this movie, the fact of the matter remains that he is one of the worst actors in Bollywood. The significant job of any actor should be only Acting nothing beyond that and Salman Khan is one of those who actually doesn't know any kind of Acting.

348,Race 3 (2018),1.9,Remo D'Souza (as Remo),"A successful franchise,huge star cast, holiday release and SALMAN KHAN. ""Race 3"" has all the ingredients to make a perfect blockbuster masala entertainer and hopes to be Salman Khan's 4th entrant into the coveted 300 cr club. So does the 3rd film in the ""Race"" series match up to its predessors and the hype generated?. Lets find out.

Story: First of all, there is no story to review so this section should have been left blank. There is literally no plot, the characters are flat and one dimensional, there is no conflict, while watching the film I was wondering whether the person who wrote the film has any knowledge of basic storytelling or any sense of creativity. The dialouges are cring-worthy and it seems they were written by a 4th grader. The plot twists which are a trademark of the Race franchise are predictable and plain stupid.Even the most loyal of Salman Khan fans will find it hard to digest this joke of a screenplay which is lost in this 130 crore disaster of a film.

Direction,Editing,Production: I think Remo D Souza should just stick to being a choreographer as Direction is clearly not his cup of tea. His take of the Race series is a huge downgrade from that of Abbas-Mustan who gave the Race series its own trademark feel. The intelligent story telling of Abbas Mustan is clearly missing.You know a disaster is bound to happen when you give a below average director, a weak script and thats exactly what happened. The production design and Cinematography is top notch and slick which gives the film a stylish look.

Acting: Even an AI Robot can offer more expressions and better dialouge delivery than Salman Khan in this film. Salman Khan's casting is a complete misfit and you will definitely miss the suave Ranveer Singh played by Saif Ali Khan. Salman Khan comes out as a sore thumb and its pretty evident that he just sleep walked through the film. Unfortunately, Bobby Deol has made a forgettable comeback and he has again proved that he simply cant act. Daisy Shah and Jacquline Fernandes have simply been cast to up the glamour quotient of the film. Even a talented actor like Saqib Saleem is wasted. Only Anil Kapoor's performance is the sole saving grace of the film and he has done a commendable job given the pathetic script he was given to act for.

Music: This has to be one of the most ridiculous soundtracks of all time. Each and every song is just plain bad with even worse lyrics. The Allah Duhai hai theme song is the only hummable track in this disaster of an album.

Underline: No style and No substance. The film has clearly lost the race against its predessors and even a stupid Race 2 looks like Inception in front of this film.The only race this film wins is for ""worst movie of the year"" and its just June."

It self from the starting you will get to know that this film is a pure garbage. Acting direction, songs are below average. In few scenes you will feel like I can act better than Salman, though I don't know why the person sitting next to me is clapping(may be a fan) I won't lie, I love the climax. Don't go for this movie and if you go don't go for 3D. There was no screenplay in the film, all are just doing their own things and It's really annoying to watch salman for 2 hours. Selfish song can kill you, better take loo time. It's just a high budget film with unnecessary stunts and blowing off cars. Childrens below 15 might like the film. Better go for veere di weedin"

So it's so obvious that the entire cast is either overacting or not trying at all. Salman Khan and Bobby Deal are horrible fit in the movie. to top it all even Anil Kapoor seemed to be overacting.I would have rated it 1 but the additional 2 stars are for the actresses who did a decent job. Direction: Remo D'Souza is by far the worst director for the race series. He's just blown as many cars as he could and tried to show the lead actors ripped and thought it would make a great movie.

358,Race 3 (2018),1.9,Remo D'Souza (as Remo),"I really liked the first 2 race films mainly because they were directed by Abbas-Mustan but they didn't return for the 3rd instalment which was a big disappointment.

This is just a different movie with ""Race"" in the title that tried really hard to be intelligent but just ended up being plain dumb fun and I didn't even bother to link all of the character's motives with one an other as the film makers clearly didn't as well. It was like they are changing their minds rather than making sure they know who's side they are on.

The action was the only thing that saved the movie but some it is was cheesy and the first wing suit stunt looked faker than a PS1 game.

It was good to see Bobby Deol back which is what I liked about it and you can tell that he was well prepared for the role after a long come back.

The songs were not only bad but was a huge misfit for this kind of movie, probably for any Bollywood movie as they were mostly romantic songs and this is supposed to be an action thriller. The songs were a total waste and appeared every 10 minutes.

If there is anything that I learned from this movie is that if anyone betrays you then you should sing a song to them, I talking about the Allah Duhai Hai song.

Overall this is nothing more than a time-pass movie if your not a Salman Khan fan."

368,Race 3 (2018),1.9,Remo D'Souza (as Remo),"I usually really enjoy Bollywood films and unlike most Americans, I've seen hundreds of the films. Sure, there have been a few stinkers here and there but nothing like ""Race 3"" because this film has the distinction of being the only Indian film now on the infamous Bottom 100 list on IMDB. With a pathetically low score of only 2.1, it really is a film that few people have loved! Will I be yet another person who thinks this is an absolutely terrible film??

Yes. I thought the film was terrible as well and for two big reasons. First, the entire story is about a family of monsters. Don't get the wrong idea, they aren't literally monsters but rich folks who are arms merchants who will sell to ANYONE and who are all lethal killing machines. The father built up the company and apparently trained his twin son and daughter to be self-absorbed murder machines as well as his adopted son. During the course of the movie, they murder dozens and dozens--with an ease that would scare away the Terminator and they look as if they just walked off the cover of 'Vogue"" or ""GQ""!! They are simply evil scum...and the movie seems to romanticize them and it's also really hard to care about anyone in the film. Second, the film is over-stylized to the point that it was ridiculous. The fights were downright silly--with too much slo-mo, mid-air spins, bullets having no effect on any of them and all while wearing the most stylish fashions. It seemed silly...really silly...especially when one of them literally jumped from thousands of feet to join in the fight while wearing a bat-like suit and then crashing into the warehouse. He and his sibs then wiped out a veritable army of well armed soldiers...and none of them broke a sweat nor got injured!! I really wish instead they had spent less time and money in making these ridiculous fight scenes and simply filmed them as if the leads were humans and not gods!! It was simply ludicrous...and seemed almost like watching the Kardashians starring in a super-over stylized Bond film!! Laughable to say the least.

I lay all the blame for me hating this movie on the director and producers. They never showed ANY restraint and should have dialed back on the crazy super-human aspects of the movie as well as the constant blaring music and super-wealthy locations and costumes. None of them seemed to wonder if they were creating a film that was less an entertaining drama and more an unintentional but unlikable comedy. Oh, and I didn't even mention the song and dance numbers. They ARE common in Indian pictures...but the amount of auto-tuning they did make for some weird techno-sounding singing....though the dancing itself was pretty typical for Bollywood.

Rarely have I seen this much money spent to create a film this dumb."

I've liked few of Salman Khan's movie's before but one can clearly see the lack of efforts delivered by Salman. It's like he's not even trying to make the scene appear convincing. It's just insulting to the viewers.

The only actor who's done a good job is Anil Kapoor rest everyone badly needs acting lessons.

The storyline is okay but the movie is terribly made which doesn't make the suspense feel like suspense. Also, the lead role dying and coming back needs to stop in the Race franchise, it's happened in every movie.

The movie doesn't have any good action sequence either to qualify for action genre, this movie is a family drama.

This movie is for kids who wishes to see some fancy cars and a tourism ad for the United Arab Emirates."

400,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"There are people out there who will greenlight anything! That is the only explanation I can offer as to why the House of the Dead movie exists. And that's only scary part to the whole movie. It's so bad you'll go off movies forever. I seriously wanted to switch this off and turn the TV over to the Paint Drying channel but I was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing. I don't know why I do these bad things to myself.

As if it matters, here's the basic jist of the 'story'. A group of twenty-somethings are so desperate to go out to some island in the Pacific Northwest (Canada actually, because it's cheap) for the 'Rave of the Century' (which consists of about 8 people and un-raving music) that they pay some craggy old fisherman $1000 to take them there after they miss the main ferry. That's gotta be some rave to be worth all that dough! The fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the Island of the Dead (hang on-I thought this was HOUSE of the Dead?) and that they are all doomed yadda yadda yadda.

First faults here. Why would a tiny little rave (of the Century my foot!) be held on some remote island? Why would anyone willingly pay loads of money to get it? Why pay even more to the craggy old fisherman to take them back when they could just come back with the others?

Once they arrive they discover that the rave (which consists of about 2 tents, a small stage and a port-a-john) has been smashed, there's blood everywhere and no one is around. What would any rationally thinking person do? Run for their lives of course. But no, these clueless, obviously blind people decide to go look for them. Soon enough they discover an old ramshackle house that's 50 times as big on the inside as it is on the outside. Another half hour of stumbling around in the forest follows, as an excuse to kill of some of the lesser characters, and after much tedium they arrive back at the house again. The characters, like the movie, go nowhere.

Jammed into this ghastly disaster is a superabundance of gibberish dialogue, heinous acting, mumbo-jumbo exposition and zillions of clips from the once-popular arcade game of the same name. Why this was universally accepted as a good idea with the filmmakers I'll never know. The clips have no reference to any of the scenes and only degrade this trash even further, if that is at all possible.

It has nothing to do with the game save for some cheap, throwaway line at the end. It makes Resident Evil look like cinematic glory. Hell, even the Double Dragon movie seems multi-Oscar worthy in comparison to this junk. The only one who comes out of this with his dignity still intact is Jurgen Prochnow. He could have just taken his money and ran but he tries his best with the awful script and brings a tiny bit of pathos to his character. The rest of the cast suck I'm afraid. The characters are idiots and deserve to die.

Plus, if you cut out the swearing and pointless nudity, I see no reason why this film cannot be shown on Saturday morning TV. It's not frightening in the slightest. Pirates of the Caribbean is more scary than the skeletal bad guys in this film. And where did all those bad guys come from anyway? There were only a few people on the island to begin with. I guess this justifies the reason they chose to reuse footage over and over. I kid you not, you'll see the same zombie die a dozen times.

Who's ultimately to blame for that scandalous waste of celluloid? None other than director Uwe Boll. His control over the movie is non-existent. You can clearly the see actors have no idea what they should be doing and that the zombies aren't really taking it all seriously. The actors seem like they're reading off cue cards as they constantly pause in the middle of long sentences and carry on talking as soon as they see the next card. It all feels very unnatural.

Plus the film is shot like a two-part mini-series. I have indeed seen better TV productions. And don't get me started on the editing. The film is an incoherent babble with thousands upon thousands of pointless shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans. No real skill or talent was put into making this at all. It truly baffles and boggles the mind how movies this unfathomably bad can get made and George A. Romero can't even get anyone to take his calls. House of the Dead makes some idiotic reference to Romero in a lazy attempt to be 'post-modern' but it only irritates that they think THIS is in the same league as a REAL zombie movie.

For what it's worth, the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture looks great and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and only serves to pronounce the heavily over-used ADR even more. The DVD comes with extras but why torture yourself. Isn't this review warning enough? Stay away! You are all doomed I tell you! Doomed! Doomed!!!"
401,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"There are some movies you just know they are going to be bad from frame one. Even if you were totally oblivious of Ed Wood's work, one look at that commentator from ""Plan 9 from outer space"" and you just KNOW you are not gonna see the next cinematic masterpiece. Just like that, when I saw the first shot of Uwe Bolls masterpiece ""House of Dead"", with that guy sitting at the front of the house starting his introduction while trying desperately to sound like he just arrived from Sin City, I knew I'm in for a helluva ride.

So, the movie starts like this - first the lead character says that everybody else is going to die. You know, to keep you wandering. Then he starts introducing the rest of the characters with lines like ""Karma..thinks she's Foxy Brown"" or ""Alicia..my ex.. we broke up recently.. I had to study and she had to fence"". No, I'm not kidding.

Anyway, this bunch of 20-somethings who couldn't act their way out of a wet paper-bag are going to the ""Rave of the century"", rave in question being a few tents, a port-a-potty and a shoddy stage located on small island in the middle of the Pacific. Our gang missed the ferry, but thankfully will find a way to get there, the way being a fisher-boat ran by Kirk (Cpt Kirk? Get it? Man, whoever wrote this script is a genius) and his sidekick who is a bastard child of Simpsons' Cpt McAllister and that hook killer who knows what you did last summer.

To make the long story short, the gang gets to the island, finds nobody there except some bloody T-shirts and then decide to run the hell away from there. No wait, they do not, they actually get all happy and like cos there's free booze.

With that scene the movie hits rock bottom and then against all odds proceeds to go further downhill. Some guys in rubber suits start running around, there is some screaming and shooting, our gang goes to some house to meet some other gang, they go out of the house, meet Cpt Kirk and some police woman (who between them have about 500 pounds of weapons) and then decide to go back to the house. Somewhere along the line they transform into a S.W.A.T. team, enter the Matrix, the rubber-suit guys start multiplying like bacteria and I start to cry because I actually paid to see this. To add insult to the injury, every few minutes there are shots from the video game this crap is based on and there is a cute game-over cut-scene for a few characters when they die.

I seriously hate this movie. It doesn't even fit in that famed ""So bad it's good"" category. It's just plain bad. The script is bad, the zombies are awful, there is no tension, lines are bad, actors are bad.. the list just goes on.

You will probably want to see this movie just because of its reputation of being awful. Don't. There are bad movies that deserve to be watched. This is not one of them."
402,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"IT SUCKS! I don't mean that it's so bad it's good, I mean it IS the ultimate low. This is as bad as ""Ax 'Em""! My friend unwittingly bought this piece of garbage (not a compliment this time) and we stumbled into watching one of the most excruciating wastes of celluloid EVER! When hearing that Dave ""Dead Hate the Living!"" Parker was to write this, I figured he would provide the fulfillment to go with the ever-so-slight promise I believed I saw in him earlier on. Maybe it was or wasn't his screw-up, but this is just unbelievable. How horrid can a movie get? A dumbass with a video camera (sign of the artist!) makes self-referential quips about Romero films to let you know it's supposed to be a real, bona fide throwback. When various characters die, it's made to look as if they've lost a video game. See actual video game footage spliced into action scenes that make Ed Wood, Jr. look superior! And, no, it's not funny because IT IS THAT DAMN BAD. Everything about it, everything! What a shambles! And don't make the mistake of thinking getting high will help you enjoy it... we WASTED our high on this piece of slimy maggot excrement! PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF WHATEVER ICON YOU PUT IN FRONT OF YOU OR THE LACK THEREOF, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! It WILL be a waste of your time and money. That is, unless you're even more into stubbing out hot ashes on your soul than I am! PLEASE! NO! BEWARE! AVOID AT ALL COSTS! IT'S JUST THAT BAD! IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME AND MY FRIEND, BUT NOT FOR YOU! NOOOOOOO......"
403,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Ok, first of all, I am a huge zombie movie fan. I loved all of Romero's flicks and thoroughly enjoyed the re-make of Dawn of the Dead. So when I had heard every single critic railing this movie I was still optimistic. I mean, critics hated Resident Evil, and while it may not be a particularly great film, I enjoyed it if not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shoot-em up with a half decent plot. This however, is pure crap. Terrible dialogue, half-assed plot, and video game scenes inserted into the film. Who in their right mind thought that was a good idea. The only thing about this movie (I use the term loosely) that I enjoyed was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). While his name throws originality out the window, you can see in his performance that he knows he's in a god awful film and he might as well make the best of it. Everyone else acts as if they're doing Shakespeare. And very badly I might add. Basically the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you a.) Are a huge zombie buff and must see every zombie flick made or b.) Like to play MST3K, the home game. See it with friends and be prepared for tons of unintentional laughs."
404,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"This is one of the worst films I've seen. The only positive thing I can say is it was so bad that is seemed comical. First off, there's no plot. The actors appear to be reading off cue cards and do the dumbest things. Such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends. Also the zombies were terrible, no where near as fun as any of Romero's work, who gets s plug in the movie. And the dumbest part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences. Like we don't get the video game is about shooting zombies. Also, all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun. And the way the people die is so stupid. It's like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on. And when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open, So dumb.

FINAL VERDICT: If any of these actors appear in another film, then they've been blessed with a second chance. Definitely the worst film I've seen in years. A B-movie on cinemax is better."
405,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Laid up and drugged out, as a kidney stone wended its merry way through my scarred urinary tract, with absolutely nothing better to do than let the painkillers swoon me into semi-oblivion, I happened to catch this movie on cable. I wouldn't want anyone to think that I paid to view it in a cinema, or rented it, or  heaven forfend!  that I watched it STRAIGHT.

Having played this sensationally gruesome video game and avidly trod the doomed rooms and dread passageways of The House, battling Chariot (Type 27), The Hanged Man (Type 041), and other impossible sentinels, my curiosity was piqued as to how the game would transfer to the movie screen.

It doesn't.

The banal plot revolves around a group of ""crazy kids""  a la Scooby Doo  attending a remote island for a world-shaking ""rave""  whatever that is. (You kids today with your hula-hoops and your mini-skirts and your Pat Boone) After bribing a boat captain thousands in cash to ferry them there (a stupidity which begs its own network of rhetoric), they find the ""rave"" deserted.

Passing mention is made of a ""house""  presumably the titular House Of The Dead  but most of the action takes place on fake outdoor sets and other locales divorced from any semblance of haunted residence.

A fallen video camera acts as flashback filler, showing the island in the throes of a  party?! Is that it? Oh, so this ""rave"" thingy is just a ""party""? In the grand tradition of re-euphemizing ""used cars"" as ""pre-owned"", or ""shell shock"" as ""post-traumatic stress disorder"", the word ""party"" is now too square for you drug-addled, silicone-implanted, metrosexual jagoffs?

It is learned that the party was broken up by rampaging zombies. Intelligent thought stops here

I don't think the pinheads who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the mythos behind zombie re-animation. Zombies can't die  they're already UN-DEAD. They do not bleed, they know no pain. Unless their bodies are completely annihilated, they will continue being animated. At least, that's what my Jamaican witch priestess tells me.

Which means that a .45 shot into their ""hearts"" is not going to stop them, nor will a machete to the torso. And a shotgun blast to the chest will certainly NOT bring forth gouts of blood. At least in the video game's logic, the shooter pumps so many rounds into each monster that it is completely decimated, leaving a fetid mush that cannot re-animate itself.

Yet each actor-slash-model gets their Matrix-circular-camera moment, slaying zombies on all fronts with single bullets and karate chops to the sternum. Seriously, these zombies are more ineffective than the Stormtroopers from ""Return Of The Jedi"", who get knocked out when Ewoks trip them.

I suppose the film's writer, Mark Altman, having penned the not-too-shabby ""Free Enterprise"", felt compelled to insert a Captain Kirk reference, in the character of Jurgen Prochnow, who must have needed milk money desperately to have succumbed to appearing in this aromatic dung-swill. There is also a reference to Prochnow's primo role in the magnificent ""Das Boot"", when one of the untrained B-actors mentions that he ""looks like a U-Boat Captain"". "". I wonder how many of this movie's target audience of square-eyed swine picked up on ANY of the snide references to other films, as when Prochnow declares, ""Say hello to my little friend"", presaging his machine gun moment.

Aimed at a demographic who have not the wherewithal to comprehend the Sisyphean futility of the video-game concept (i.e. the game ends when you die  you cannot win), this is merely a slasher film for the mindless and mindless at heart. Accordingly, everyone dies in due course, except for a heterosexual pair of Attractive White People.

A better use for this film's scant yet misused budget might have been to send the cast through Acting School, although Ona Grauer's left breast did a good job, as did her right breast  and those slomo running scenes: priceless! I especially liked the final scene with Ona trying to act like she's been stabbed, but looking like she's just eaten ice cream too fast.

Attempting to do something more constructive with my time, I pulled out my Digitally-Restored, 35th Anniversary, Special Edition, Widescreen Anamorphic DVD of ""Manos: The Hands Of Fate."" Ah, yes!  the drugs were suitably brain-numbing - now HERE was some quality film-making

406,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"This is by far THE WORST movie i have ever watched. I've seen some pretty awful movies in my time but this ones takes the cake, no, wait, i mean the the whole damn bakery. It is so bad that i believe a word to describe the way you will feel after watching this atrocity has yet to be created. Please just do yourself a favor, if you ever get the urge to watch this and watch thirty minutes of that annoying purple dinosaur Barney, then multiply that thirty times fold and you would still only get a small fraction of the horror you would be in store for. In summation, i guess you really can call it a horror movie, but only if you're willing to be scared senseless by the worst acting in the business and utterly pointless story.

408,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Okay, so I'm not a big video game buff, but was the game House of the Dead really famous enough to make a movie from? Sure, they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the movie, as though justifying any particular scene of violence, but there are dozens and dozens of games that look exactly the same, with the hand in the bottom on the screen, supposedly your own, holding whatever weapon and goo-ing all kinds of aliens or walking dead or snipers or whatever the case may be.

It's an interesting premise in House of the Dead, with a lot of college kids (LOADED college kids, as it were, kids who are able to pay some fisherman something like $1,500 just for a ride after they miss their boat) trying to get out to this island for what is supposed to be the rave of the year. The first thing that comes to mind about House of the Dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations. At least in this case, the fact that they were on their way to a rave excuses the way the girls are dressed. They look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little halter-tops, but at least they THOUGHT they were dressed for the occasion.

Clint Howard, tellingly the most interesting character in the film by far, delivers an absolutely awful performance, the greatness of which overshadows every other actor in the movie. I can't stand it when well-known actors change their accents in movies, it is so rarely effective, and Howard here shows that it is equally flat to have an well-known actor pretend that he's this hardened fisherman with a raspy voice from years of breathing salty air. He didn't even rasp well. It sounded like he was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally inhaled some powdered sugar or something. Real tough there, Clint! I expected more from him, but then again, he did agree to a part in this mess.

Once we get to the island, the movie temporarily turns into any one of the Friday the 13th movies that took place at Camp Crystal Lake. Lots of teenagers played by actors who were way too old for their parts getting naked and then killed. The nudity was impressive, I guess, but let's consider something for a minute. These kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the Rave Of The Year, find NO ONE, and say, well, who wants a beer! Even the guy who pulled that stack of hundreds out of his wallet to get them all over there didn't think anything of it that they found a full bar and not a single solitary person in sight. Here you have the input from director Uwe Boll - There's alcohol! They won't notice that the party they came for consists of no one but themselves!

So not only do they start drinking, not minding the fact that the whole party seems to have vacated the island, but when one of the girls goes off into the dark woods to find out where everyone is (dragging one other girl and one of the guys reluctantly along), the guy and the girl who stay behind to get smashed decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for a quickie now that they're alone. It's like they expected to find the island empty, and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while, they would have some privacy since there's no one else around. Brilliant!

Now for the things that everyone hated, judging by the reviews that I've read about the movie. Yes, intersplicing shots from the video game into the movie, mostly in order to show that, yes, the movie was being faithful to/directly copying the video game. Sure, it was a stupid idea. I can't imagine who thought up that little nugget, but worse than that is the Matrix-style bullet time scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over. After the first time (at which point I found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like that as though it was something original) it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning or creation of any kind of tension for the film.

One of the things that makes a zombie film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly coming after the living humans, who are much faster but getting tired, running out of places to run, and with a terrifying shortage of things with which to fight the zombies off with. The first two are done right in the movie, the kids are terrified and don't have a lot of places to run since they're on an island, but since they caught a ride over with a smuggler, they find themselves heavily armed. And I mean that very strongly. I mean, these people have everything from machine guns to hand grenades, which removes most of the tension of the impending walking dead.

Then you have what I call the techno-slasher scene. Since the rave never happened, and I guess since Uwe Boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any techno music in the movie, there's one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead, and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video. There's techno music blasting as the shots are edited together faster and faster until it's nothing but a blur of gory shot, mostly only about 5 frames long (which is about 1/6 of a second) flashing across the screen in time with the speed techno music. Clever, I guess, but it has no place in a horror movie because it completely removes any sense of scariness or tension of even the gross-out effect because you can't see any one thing for long enough to react to it. You're just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when he decided that it would be a good idea to put something like this in the movie.

I've seen a lot of people compare this movie to Resident Evil, mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it, and they're exactly right. I appreciate that at least here, as was not the case in Resident Evil, it wasn't some man-made virus that turned people into walking dead that were able to infect other people, changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires. 28 Days Later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie, it's just too bad that House of the Dead didn't do a single original thing, except for the somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots of the video game on which it is based, just in case you forget. I really think that this should have been a much better movie. While obviously I can't say that I know much about the game it's based on, just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie, but unfortunately I think that's more often the case than not with horror movies. It's really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a no-holds-barred horror film, and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot, which suggests the possibility of a sequel."
409,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"I found this movie in the 'horror' section of my video store. That seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there. From Romero's 'Dead' trilogy to '28 days later.' However upon watching it, you can quickly see what this movie really is.

It is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory. There is no horror here folks. Just some half-way decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last... and last... and last... and soon you get the feeling maybe you're DVD player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes, but no, this is how they actually made the movie. It's a pity. I think anyone could find a better use for $7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o' crud. Though some of the 360 effects were cool, but once again, they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time, just with a different character.

Also what is ROYALLY annoying is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game. I've played the game. It sucks. So why did they put it in here? Oh that's right, this isn't a movie but a music video, and it's a poor one at that. 3/10

Rated R: a lot of violence/gore, and profanity"

Besides the plot that isn't really there, the comically crap acting, the hilariously dreadful excuses for zombies; You know what, I could go on all day.

411,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Actually reasonably enjoyable, but in a comic book, silly kinda way. This is by no stretch of the imagination a good movie in any sense, but you cant help but laugh yourself silly through most of it.

Plot line is this: A group of ravers travel to an island near Seattle, an island known as Isla del Morte (Island of the dead, and my Spanish spelling is likely incorrect). Once they arrive, they find the biggest rave of the year deserted. Why? they find out once they stumble upon survivors and are shown video footage of what happened.

This is really an elementary movie, poorly written by Mark Altman (who did one of my favorite films, ""Free Enterprise"") and equally poorly acted by the mainly unknown cast. Along with Jurgen Prochnow, Ellie Cornell (""Halloween"" 4 & 5) and Clint Howard (Ron's brother) are the only names I recognized. I really don't expect much from Clint (and he certainly delivered in that area) but Ellie and Jurgen usually do a little better than they showed here.

Johnathan Cherry is really dull as Rudy, Tyron Leitso's Simon is an irritating little weasel, Ona Grauer's Alicia is really nice to look at, but not much else...so on and so forth.

Lots and lots of pop culture references, including a mention of George A. Romero and the possibility of a 4th ""Dead"" film. See this one if you're a Romero fan...please...its a zombie movie and if the industry thinks thats what we want, then we'll get George's final vision that much sooner.

This is just not a good movie, but if you're like me and enjoy giving the ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" treatment to bad films, you should see this one.

1/2 out of 5"

But I still wanted to watch it because I'm a huge fan of the game and I wanted to see what doe's the film have that makes it so bad. After watching it I do agree that it is crap, the movie had no story. In the first 15-20 minutes there was nothing but topless teenage girls with no brains running about (for a moment there I was wondering are the zombies brain-dead? or the girls are?) then at night time the zombies popped out of nowhere & started attacking people later a woman started shooting them I mean it takes you one place then the other every 5 minutes. Is it supposed to be a comedy?, or horror? or both? Before I knew it I fell asleep at the second half & woke up during the end credits so I did not manage to watch all of it, which is a good thing!

415,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"This movie has received a lot of bad press from people who don't understand what it was meant to be. One must understand that this movie was never meant to be taken seriously. It's camp, along the same lines as ""Army of Darkness."" AoD was silly, but funny and bad in a good way. ""House of the Dead"" fails to be ""good bad."".

There are qualities inherent in good campy movies, most important of those being believable fantasy. One needs to believe what's happening in a movie to see the humor when a situation goes incredibly wrong. Without boundaries, the movie becomes absurd. HotD lacks any believability.

Worse still, HotD brings nothing new to the genre, and repeats the same plot twists and character reactions that many horror movies inevitably start to exhibit. For example, all too often, horror movies fall into the trap where the main characters find love amongst the gore and destruction. I don't know about you, but when I'm being chased by zombies, I wanna make out with a hot chick. Believe it? No? Then, you probably won't believe it when the characters start sucking each other's faces in this movie.

Beyond the obvious issues that plague this movie like so many other horror movies, Uwe Boll elected to add scenes from the video game of zombies being shot, randomly whenever a character shoots a zombie in the movie. Not only is there no clear rationale for this artistic choice, but it distracts one from an already unbelievable plot. Further, there are frequent and numerous examples of bad acting, and seemingly no attempts by the director to guide the actors' reactions to events... leaving the movie with no redeeming qualities.

416,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"You know that feeling of hilarity you get when you watch a film that's trying so hard to be a serious, thought provoking piece of cinema and fails miserably? When you can't help but bust out laughing at the sheer terrible nature of the trash littering your screen? ""House of the Dead"" struggles to achieve even this low graded level of cinema.

From start to end ""House of the Dead"" manages to recreate the feeling like you've just woken up to find out that the cat has laid it's curled business neatly on your forehead while you slept. It is clear from the start that the female actors have been cast for their cleavage size (which they exploit shamelessly) whereas the males for their hardcore ""kick-ass"" attitude. I honestly did not care any of the characters for any moment of the film and found myself actually wishing their demise so as to spare me a good hour of this torture. Uwe Boll should have considered screening two hours of footage from the actual game as a movie. At least then we'll get better acting However not all blame can be placed on the actors as it is certainly a challenge to produce a convincing film when faced with the script of this film. It is arguably the worst section of the film and actually contains such lines as: ""These are zombies, pure and simple"" and ""No cap'n, we must not go there! It's evil!"".

We all know that Zombie movies are never going to be particularly thought provoking or full of meaning; at best they are a harmless two hours of action, blood and closet terror. Trash, yes, but entertaining trash. Not the kind of trash which bursts out of your bin bag as you haul it across the room and smothers your shoes in sour milk cartons and decaying banana skins. According to IMDb, ""House of the Dead"" received such bad reviews that no Danish cinemas bought the movie. If only we could have had the same privilege.

Final Score: 1/10."

I got up today to find this playing on TV... didn't catch the very start but that obviously does not matter at all.. and within a cpl min I was questioning if they were seriously this idiotic or if they were trying to make this movie this bad intentionally..

Well.. stupid me.. wasted time actually watching more of this craptacular pile of steaming ... no wait.. that's too polite a description.. and a pile like that at least would be useful as fertilizer..

Suffice to say watching this continued while feeding my youngest son his lunch (Thankfully he's too young to understand any of this) and it just kept getting worse.. and worse.. and WORSE.. and WWWWWOOOORRRRSSEEEEE!!!!!!

AMC.. the channel that has helped with some spectacularly good Zombie action (Walking Dead anyone?) and a few other excellent shows.. but has it's head firmly up up it's collective ass with idiotic butchering of movies was happy to put this on and then it's sequel (which can't help but be better since UWE is not involved).. and edited it for language.. but did not have the decency to cut out the entire film and substitute a simple still shot saying:

This is a test of the EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYSTEM

This film is directed by UWE BOLL.

Turn the channel NOW to save your sanity and lock the doors since the world is obviously ending when we have run out of garbage to put on TV and are reduced broadcasting this crap..

But don't worry.. we edited out the language so your sensitive ears won't ever hear profanity!!!!.. (We can't control the profanity undoubtedly being uttered by all of those watching this crap)

Now laugh all you want.. this review is idiotic and absurd.. and its intentionally so.. but at least this has saved you from wasting time of your life you will never get back from watching this load of total steaming sh*t (Seriously IMDb? Have to edit this word?? /facepalm @ that being as stupid and idiotic as AMC's butchering of films. Both pathetic and extremely childish esp since kids know that word very well by the time they hit school!) from UB...

Now as the title says:

OMFG will someone PLEASE STOP GIVING UWE BOLL MONEY!!!

Seriously!!! The man destroys everything he ever touches and some idiots keep giving him $ to make more movies..

Hell even his disaster version of AD&D.. which basically writes it'self it's so fantastically easy to get right.. and he managed to butcher it to death in a horrific fashion..

They gave him Bloodrayne, AD&D and at least a dozen others with potential... again craptacular garbage from hell every single time.... his touch is like King Midas only its CRAP instead of gold!

There seriously needs to be a public safety warning with everything that man ever touches!! Hell even his breathing or uttering the words related to any movie does untold damage to us all!

So for the sake of the children, puppies, kittens and whatever else you can add into that.. STOP GIVING HIM MONEY to make movies!!!

FFS

Pay him to NOT make movies and we will all be better off!!

Seriously!!!!

This pathetic excuse for a movie is just abysmal.. and while I've worked in the industry and am prod of some of the good stuff we have done here in Canada.. this is NOT one of them and the fact he was even allowed into the country to film this is worthy of investigation since it's an abomination to our film industry and whomever issued him the permits needed needs to be fired!!!

The films packs action,terror,spectacular struggles and lots of blood and gore. Based on terrifying and successful video game with same title.The movie takes parts of ¨Resident Evil I and II Apocalypse, Dawn of dead and Doom¨.Thus it belongs to sub-genre about cinematic adaptation video-play where the authentic protagonists are a speedy Zombies and as always persistent. Zombies,like George A Romero have slow reflexes ,however here are rapid and more intelligent,aggressive,can move as fast and fierce as animals and as always hungry.The picture contains spectacular confrontation near the house and another impressive final fighting.Noisy hard rock and synthesizer score accompanies to the action film.The motion picture is regularly directed by Uwe Boll(Alone in the dark,Heart of America).Rating : average though entertaining."

423,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"There's a massive rave happening on a jungle infested island that has a demented past. A group of teenagers who are running late hitch a ride on fishing boat and they arrived to find the scene completely deserted. Though, something isn't quite right as they find an abandon house where they discover some party-goers who claimed that they were attacked by some sort of zombies. Now it's up to this group of people to figure a way to get off the island or they shall meet an unpleasant demise from hordes of zombies.

So, this is ""House of the dead"" and I just got to say it was just woefully incompetent schlock. I guess my curiosity just got the better of me when I saw it was playing on TV. While watching it, I thought it was on the music channel at times, as it mainly felt like an over-extended music clip. Director Uwe Boll's film is nothing but pretentious garbage and an incredibly lousy effort. It really has nothing going for it well, it did have nice island scenery and fair makeup effects and a good amount of blood and gore. But these things couldn't carry this plain dreadful film. On show are paper-thin material and unlikeable characters. The actual lacklustre plot fails logic, it's filled with yawn inducing clichés, even the back-story of these zombies is poorly setup and it ends with a diabolical finale. Though, what it sorely missed was humour! But then again it probably thought it was funny, but I just didn't see it. It felt like the film was actually taking itself rather serious and if so, well there you go. The performances are either wooden or atrocious and the characters are mundane and annoying. You just don't care for these hoons. There's even a young Bruce Campbell look alike, but he doesn't have the charisma or talent of that great actor. The dialogue is rather mindless drivel, which is filled with bad puns and mind numbing lines. It's nothing but tripe and stereotypical circumstances.

The direction is just a muddle. Boll was trying too hard to make his film super coooool. Instead he lacked imagination in his execution, therefore making it super dull and uneventful. What else didn't help was the dumb editing of sequences of the actual video game to cut to new scenes. The score was mostly nonexistent, but not the damn techno soundtrack that pop up during the action scenes my ears!!! It was just too much. When the techno music kicked in, so did the flashy camera-work that also got on my nerves. With its 360 degrees camera shots and shaky panning. Though, it was the slow-mows, which Boll centred on and really, it was not needed. It was just too distracting and rather lame. These action set pieces went on for far too long, which made it feel like everything was in slow-mow. What didn't help these moments was that no tension was generated and the action was mainly unexciting and pedestrian. No scares or thrills are evident. The romance sequences were just odd and rather laughable, with some characters finding love while battling zombies. A lot moments became a real drag because they dwelled on nothingness and too many sequences became really repetitive e.g. too many save yourself scenarios and a lot chasing about I mean a lot! Some shots were actually used over and over again. Yes, this is a pointless and unsatisfying mess of a production.

After seeing this film you'll be thinking what the hell was that? Or why did I bother? Just plain boring and numbing is the best way of putting it!"
424,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"One thing is clear. Until i met a great educational flick called 'House Of The Dead' by Dr. Uwe Boll, there had been not a single film that i decided stop watching in the middle of viewing. Yes i mean it. I never quit a movie in the middle of watching it no matter how it sucks or bores because i'm a type of guy who is over-patient and likes the phrase ""it ain't over til it's over"". Once i play a movie, then i finish it by all means, only unless inevitable things happen and force me to quit it in the middle. That was basic cinema-watching attitude of mine for 30 years.

And then suddenly, one day about a year ago, i happened to meet this great educational flick and it broke my history just like a revolution. I played it, and Jesus can you believe, i quit and ran exactly at 40 minutes without any special situations or reasons.

Yogi, i'm afraid you're wrong. Something must be over before it's over...

That's not only thing that i learned from this great educational flick. I admit that i generally tend to ignore (or intentionally skip) others' reviews or comments on some films which i've not seen yet, and especially for majority of opinions i don't care for them at all. Yes it's just like ""I don't listen to anybody before viewing it myself and valuating is just mine"".....

430,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"There isn't one horror movie out there that leaves me laughing and shaking in my seat more than House of the Dead had. After watching this last night on DVD, I'm still not sure whether I would give this movie a nod of the head or deface the cover and use the disc as a coaster.

To summarise what would be my review for House of the Dead, it would be along the lines of ""cheesy goodness"" as that what it exactly is: oozing with cheese that makes it good.After having played the game in the arcades, I was happy to have seen it on the new release shelf of my Blockbuster. The title alone was enough to have the case stand out; the cover-art was exceptional; ""From Sega's best selling video game"" the blurb cried out to me; I was sold.

House of the Dead is very disappointing in the sense that it has absolutely no storyline, no character development, no atmosphere and anything else that would make a horror movie a GOOD, at the least, horror movie. The real downside to this movie is that the ending is shown right at the beginning and it is only the process of their elimination that, I guess..., you'd want to stick around. Another would be the fact that the pace of the movie was ridiculously fast that there's no time to make a connection with the characters, let alone know who's who, and at the same time, know what on earth is going on. There is no sense of ""survival horror"" that one has appreciated in the likeness of the Resident Evil game (or movie), 28 Days Later, Living Dead Trilogy, and such which truly ruined the atmosphere. The ultimately low point of the movie was the middle where the 8 or so ""strong"" group make for the ""House of the Dead"", armed to the teeth with guns tuned in to ""kick ass"" mode, but takes an unnecessarily long time to walk 10-20 meters, even if they were killing the undead in the process. During the course of this action, there were also Matrix-like shots that, I guess because of the quality of the movie, cannot go unappreciated. Yet, there are just so many weakness in the plot, like holding a rave in an island aptly named ""Isla de Muerte"" (or something) and not finding or sensing anything strange when they arrive at the ransacked and abandoned party. If Spiderman happened to have swung past there, he'd be in a coma because of his spider senses going haywire.

Through the course of the movie, I desperately searched for the things to justify the movie's state and to why the actors oozed cheese from every hole in their body. I came to the conclusion that perhaps it was because the game characters of the ""House of the Dead"" game had the same cheesy voice acting. I guess they had that point and the shootings of the creatures (which was House of the Dead game-like), as well as the ""death"" scenes similarities down pat. Also, it is good that Sega doesn't go uncredited in the movie and I feel that Uwe Boll, as awkward as he did it, displays this appreciation. However, I guess that by the middle of the movie, you'll realize that this movie cannot be saved from the depths of ""F-movie hell"" that this had descended to.

In the end, with more funding, I think this movie could've been in a ""C-movie hell"". Different actors who felt the part and more insight into the story could've drastically changed the atmosphere of this movie. As soon as that black chick drop-kicks a downed zombie, you can't help but just start laughing at the attempts of this movie to be cool. It's so excruciatingly stupid, it's entertainingly good, yet I still find it difficult to say that this movie absolutely sucked or good for a really boring day. Perhaps, it is only for the die-hard fans of the game. On a final note, I do appreciate one character comparing the situation to the Living Dead Trilogy, claiming it to be ""The Holy Trilogy""."
431,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Considering this movie is based directly on a game, this does make it a lot harder for the director and crew to write out the script to suit the game form and to please the gamer fans! I had not played the game before, though was amazed that director Uwe Boll used original game play footage of first HOTD game to go with the movie and do believe in some of the scenes they actually did work well! For example a scene when three humans are making an escape in an underground tunnel from the zombies, the use of a first person shooter, shooting zombies then straight away jumping to game form of that same moment, I believe did actually work very well for the scene.

I give the film a 5/10 and unlike the other reviews I have read of people completely panning the movie. To be honest I did enjoy the movie's use of action scenes, humor and cheesy acting. I do believe maybe the movie could of been better if it was a bit more creepier and shocking in some parts. I did actually jump at one part when some small demon - skull swimming in a mist of red liquid emerged to the screen LOL.

Come on seriously, how could you not enjoy that full on 7 minute fight scene in the middle of the movie?! Those spinning 360 degrees cameras around the actors are no longer used in films today! Please just don't look upon the movie and think ""Now that didn't go like that in the game!"" cos believe me, a director does try their hardest to please the fans and I know must be one of the difficultest things to place on screen, including book - movie adaption, and adding new things in the movie which wasn't in the game I believe isn't a so bad idea other wise is too predictable if you already played the game.

Anyway I do think anyone could enjoy the full on action and gore the movie has to offer and not just hate the movie of not being exactly true to the game, and of course all zombie films usually have a cheesy b movie story: in this case early 20 year olds being trapped on an island with of course zombies, as they must try and reach the House of the Dead..."
432,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"I tend to enjoy the movies I watch. This means that my opinion usually goes against poorly received pieces. It happened to me with In the Name of the King, which I rather enjoyed. And there's The Bride of the Monster, which does have some stupid moments and pacing issues, but I still don't view it as catastrophic. Manos: The Hands of Fate is bad, but I respect Harold Warren for creating a movie without any kind of education in film.

So, let's turn to House of the Dead. The first 20-25 minutes were quite good. The movie begins with a short and not-too-informative introduction to the four teens that wish to get to some island, and have fun with friends there. Some, who are pickier about movies than I am, say that characters are best introduced through action than any narration, but not much is revealed about them, so it's no big deal. The dialog sequence aboard the ship was clever, funny, and served its purpose of establishing the characters, especially the captain.

Many complained about the characters' decision to stay at the deserted camp instead of running away, but please note that all but Alicia was drunk, so don't expect them to make rational decisions. Was Alicia's decision to go investigate rational? No, it wasn't, but the movie had to move forward, didn't it?

The movie went on, and I haven't gotten the impression that it was as bad as the reviews suggested it was. It looked like a typical horror movie, and it continued and ended that way. There are dark places, zombies sneaking in the forest, characters getting introduced (and killed), a hooded figure in the distance observing the humans, etc. The usual horror move stuff.

Possibly weakest part of the movie is the big shoot-out scene in front of the house. It's spectacular, but way too long. They kill zombies by the dozens, and not much else happens. One may argue that the battle scenes in The Lord of the Rings trilogy are even longer, but there are twists in them that serve a narrative purpose.

Also everyone aims perfectly, and they don't run out of ammo until the plot requires them to. Neither is an unheard-of plot device, but since the fight is very long, it becomes noticeable.

I also don't understand the narrative purpose of the in-game clips. It would have been better if Boll left them out entirely.

Surely, HotD isn't a *good* movie, but I fail to see why it received so much flak. I basically mentioned everything I disliked about HotD, and that's all I could find in a 90-minute-long movie. There are things I liked as well. Pacing is generally good, the dialogs are decent, acting is surprisingly good for a movie with this average rating. The flaws don't outweigh the pros, so I give it a 6."

434,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"I was able to attend the uncut premier at the San Francisco Indie Film Fest. The Director said he tried to make a movie that appeals to both horror fans and video game fans. Well, there are lots of fast paced special effects, lots of gratuitous nudity, and an army of gory zombies, so I suppose that is all you need for those goals. In almost every other goal, it falls short. The movie tries for an Evil Dead style camp, but isn't clever enough or witty enough. The funniest moments are unintentional (check out Mr. Howard's first scene as the grizzled seaman. Classic.) The editing is pretty bad, and the production value is close to either direct to video or a syndicated TV show. This is a decent get-drunk-and-talk-through movie, but don't waste your money in the thea"
435,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"The first thing that comes to mind after re-reading the caption of the film, it that the ""teens"" are anything but. It's worse than the 90210 stars trying to say they're still teens and attempt to play the old ""bopper"" roles. Another thing that struck me as odd is the genre is titled ""horror"". Whose idea was this? I think Weird Al must have directed this movie or perhaps the director from the Scary Movie series. I say this sincerely as it seems someone was playing a farce with the movie and making a mockery of other films in the process. From the simple plot of zombies and teen sex (quite redundant today) to overactive camera shots emulating that of The Matrix, this movie aims at outrageousness. But maybe for some it is right up their alley and the director ""delivered the goods"". That is, of course, if you are looking for some low-budget wanna-be horror-film that presents idiot heroes, topless women, overnight Rambos, and a quick concocted old curse or some other explanation for the ""terror"". I think this is today's version of something like Attack of the Giant Spider, except of course that probably had much better acting. Oh, and as a ""added-bonus"", don't be surprised to see bizarre dub-ins from the video game. Just more backward comedy if you ask m"
436,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"=====This review may contain spoilers=====

OK, here's the ""plot"": A group of college students are on their way to the ""rave of the century,"" only to find that they missed the boat. They hire a fishing boat captain to take them there. Once they arrive, they find the place completely trashed and everyone is missing (only one of them thinks that this is weird). When searching for the other ravers, our heroes instead find themselves face to face with a pack of vicious, blood-thirsty zombies. Will they survive the night? Frankly, you won't care because you'll be too busy thinking of increasingly brutal things to do to the director of this train wreck, Uwe Boll.

What can be said that hasn't already been said about this movie? It is one of the worst movies of all-time and it's not difficult to see why. It's terrible not only because it has nothing in common with the video game it is based on, but because it is so incompetent on every level imaginable.

The cinematography is amateurish and laughable. The movie seems to have been edited by a chimpanzee. Huge chunks of plot and scenes are left on the cutting floor. The action sequences are edited in ways that would make Michael Bay look like James Cameron. It's not entirely clear what the heck is going on, whether it is a sword-fight, a shootout, or a simple chase. Oh, and did I mention that Boll inserts clips from the game into the action? I'm NOT making this up! He actually does this! Why? I have no clue. Probably because he thought it looked cool, but it just makes the whole thing confusing, pointless, and stupid. Equally questionable is Bowl's abusive use of bullet-time. Every time someone shoots at a zombie, a camera does a 360 degree angle swoop around him/her. Again, I have no idea why except that Bowel thought it looked cool. But AGAIN, it just looks cheap and ridiculous, and it gave me a headache. And I just HAVE to say this, but whenever the characters go into bullet-time mode, they are holding a different weapon then they were in the previous shot!

Okay, so the editing and action sucks, but it's not the biggest problem. The acting was absolutely atrocious, and the dialogue was even worse. The actors playing the 20-somethings look too old to still be in college. I cringed every time they (or anyone else for that matter) opened their mouths and said something. Here are some lines that should go down as classics:

-""I found this book. It looks pretty old. Maybe it will help us.""

-""It looks like it's been there for a millennia.""

-""You did this to become immortal. Why?""

-""Look at that house. Should we go inside?""

-""We tried to get to the boat, but it wasn't there.""

-""They're obviously zombies, plain and simple. The sooner we accept that, the sooner we can move on with our lives.""

Those are but a few lines of dialogue these we have to sit through. What's more, the actors can't act if their lives depended on it. They show zero emotion and give their characters no personality whatsoever. They often talk as if they are reading from note cards. And whenever one of them dies, they show curiously little sadness. Even the major stars, Jurgen Prochnow and Clint Howard (who plays Prochnow's first mate) appear embarrassed to be on screen. We don't really know who these people are, so we could care less about what happens to them. Oh, and can someone PLEASE tell me how a group of college students who have never even touched a gun before magically become an expert shot AND a Kung fu master all in less than a minute? Jesus! Talk about plot holes (out of millions, trust me)! There is also a weird attempt to explain how the zombies were created. What it is I will not say, except that it doesn't make any sense and actually raises more questions than it answers.

The movie is extremely cheap-looking, too. The zombies look like extras with some gray powder thrown in their face. Sometimes they don't have any make-up on at all! Speaking of which, these ""zombies"" act most un-zombie-like. They can swim, leap incredible heights (thanks to some obviously placed trampolines), run, and even use weapons. WTF?!?!?! Oh, and zombies can't be killed, OK? In this movie, if you slash at them, shoot them anywhere on their bodies (hip, shoulder, chest, head, etc.), they die. NO! AND ZOMBIES DON'T BLEED, OK?! Man, this movie gives me a headache just trying to figure it out. Anyway, the sets look terrible as well. In particular, the titular house and the graveyard surrounding it both look like they were stolen from the Haunted Mansion ride in Disneyland. And apparently the house is magic, because it looks tiny on the outside, but is absolutely enormous inside.

I could go on and on how horrific this monstrosity is. It's worse than getting three root canals, in one day! It's worse than anything Paul W.S. Anderson can throw at us (now that's scary!). It makes you realize that suicide may not be such a bad idea after. Well actually, I don't recommend that, but you know what I mean. I could go on, but that would result in a twenty-page essay. I will conclude this review by saying that Uwe Boll is without a dount the worst filmmaker alive. This movie alone cements his status as the modern-day equivalent of Ed Wood. Hands down one of the ten worst movies I've ever seen. Stay away if you know what's good for you.

Rating: 1/10 Grade: F If I could go lower, I would.

P.S. Sorry this was a long review. I just had to get the anger I felt after watching this steaming pile of cow-crap off my chest."
437,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Another Uwe Boll video game adaptation means yet another inept effort at making a watchable film. This time we take what I'm sure is a heavily plotted, intelligent and character driven game that demanded a film adaptation (not really) and make it into a boring, generic zombie movie. It's ""House of the Dead"" people, and it sucks.

The plot begins with a character informing us that he will be the only survivor. I love it when bad movies spoil their own endings, it's the equivalent a kid with no legs challenging a pro soccer player to a game. Simon (Tyron Leitso) introduces his soon-to-be-dead friends: Greg (Will Sanderson), Alicia (Ona Grauer), Karma (Enuka Okuma) and Xynthia (Sonya Salomaa, possibly playing some kind of alien that happens to look like a human). They want to go to an awesome rave party taking place on an island but little do they know, the place is overrun by zombies. Hitching a ride there by paying two smugglers (Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Victor Kirk and his first Mate Salish, played by Clint Howard) they are chased by a harbor police officer named Jordan Casper (Ellie Cornell). It's a struggle for survival and a struggle for the audience to resist falling asleep.

The only good thing about this film is the makeup effects, which are actually pretty convincing. There's a huge army of zombies attacking our heroes and they come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. We've got aquatic zombies that can swim, moss-covered zombies that hide in the dirt, ancient skeletal zombies and even fresh zombies that basically look like regular people but with some blood all over them. If there's one good thing that could come out of this film, it's a recommendation to any aspiring horror filmmakers to hire the costume and makeup artists that were involved in this movie. Everything else is downright terrible.

Not only does the movie drop the ball from the very beginning by telling us exactly who is going to make it out alive and who isn't but it commits the biggest sin in cinema ""show, don't tell"". We don't learn in any way that's organic who the main characters are, we are simply told exactly enough information to distinguish the actors from each other with exposition at the beginning of the movie. Considering the fact that the acting is pretty weak here, maybe it was a last minute decision by director Uwe Boll to avoid as many scenes of the actors talking as possible. Some would give props to the man, but I say next time, just hire real actors.

The plot is utterly predictable, not only because we are told ahead of time what is going to happen (no, I will not let that go), but because it doesn't do anything new when it comes to the zombie horror genre. Basically every scene of people talking is just an excuse to tie together an accompanying scene where the humans are running away from or shooting at zombies. To remind us that this is a video game movie, and also presumably to obliterate any tension that might arise, the film constantly flashes to video game-y scenes. We've got clips of the game the film is based on, as well as ""game over"" type screens for some of the characters that end up biting the dust. I wish I could make up something as stupid as this. Can you imagine if someone re-edited ""Saving Private Ryan"" and called it ""Call of Duty"" by adding ""game over"" screens whenever someone was shot down? Even that movie, which is widely accepted as a masterpiece would be laughed out of theaters, so what chance does ""House of the Dead"" have with its undead-like acting abilities and paper-thin story? The movie can't even stay consistent because only some of the actors are dignified with a death screen. Meanwhile, we get 32 nearly-identical shots of polygon-based undead creatures getting shot in the face.

It's never particularly scary and even if what the hacks in charge were aiming for was a horror-action movie, leaning more towards action it would still suck the big one. There's a big scene where all of the characters have found an ammo crate (get it? Like in a video game!) and suit up for battle. They make their way to the mysterious ""house of the dead"" and encounter a huge army of zombies. For a while, it's pretty cool to see. Our remaining heroes take down legions of undead using various weapons and fancy fighting moves but the scene drags on and on. It begins by being kind of cool (maybe because before then you were falling asleep) then becomes ridiculous and funny and finally ends by being totally boring.

Even the ending of the movie ends in a big WTF moment that doesn't really make any sense. Even if you had the lowest standards imaginable, and I have been known to exhibit this illness, and basic zombie action with frequent moments of ""girls gone wild"" type nudity would interest you, the plot is so badly written, so poorly acted that there is no way you can enjoy yourself. I laughed at a moment where a party goer refused to go skinny dipping with a hot woman just so he could get killed by a zombie but like so many of Uwe Boll's films, you can't even enjoy this film ironically. It was a chore to get through and while I can, once again, praise the special effects, the surrounding story is terrible and you shouldn't waste your time with ""House of the Dead"".

439,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"If there were a movie that deserved a 0 out of 10, this would be it. 'House of the Dead' redefines the term ""bad movie"". Other bad movies, such as 'When A Stranger Calls' or 'Premonition', will actually look much better when compared to 'House of the Dead'. The basic ""plot"" of House of the Dead is a group of twenty-somethings travel to a remote island to attend the ""rave of the century"". When they get there, they only find some tents, a bar, a stage, and some bloody t-shirts. They decide to stay anyway, and they are soon attacked by zombies.

There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie. It is not entertaining. Instead, it is painful to watch because of how terrible it is. The acting is unbelievably bad. In a DVD interview, one of the actors claimed that Uwe Boll, the director, is not afraid to tell someone when they are doing a good job or a bad job in a scene. This is a blatant lie. The script appears to have been written by an 11-year-old, who decided to include a scene of someone throwing up on a girl's chest and to include the hilarious line, ""it smells like someone farted out here."" The characters have no personality or depth and they do some of the most moronic things ever seen in a horror movie. Somewhere along the way, the characters also magically transform into a SWAT team to take down the zombies. It's like they don't even have to aim their guns and they automatically shoot the zombies in the head.

The scariest thing by far about this movie is the directing. There is something wrong with Uwe Boll. Boll's camera work is astonishingly disjointed. His pans to zombies running through the forest are more silly than menacing. Worse yet, Boll actually thought it would be a good idea to include small bits of footage from the House of the Dead video game into the movie. Quite often, and at the most random times, you will suddenly see an animated zombie getting shot. It makes no sense. No one in their right mind would think that was a good idea. It's like Boll wants to remind us repeatedly that this movie is supposed to be based on the video game. Uwe Boll also decided it would be cool to include slow motion 360 degree rotating shots during the action scenes, a la 'The Matrix'. Unfortunately, he does it way too often and each shot is nauseating. The soundtrack to this movie also boggles the mind. Most action scenes are accompanied by loud rap track. This also adds to the ensuing headaches caused by the atrocious 'House of the Dead'.

'House of the Dead' isn't bad because it's based on a video game. In fact, it has very little to do with the video game. It also does not fit into the category of 'so bad that it's good'. It does however fit into the category of 'so bad that it's painful'. This movie just plain sucks. Uwe Boll should never be let anywhere near another movie set. Even his presence will curse a production. To all the directors out there: whenever one of your movies gets a bad review, all you have to do is remember that you didn't make 'House of the Dead' and you will feel much better. I will never get those 90 minutes of my life back. To sum it up, words really cannot describe just how bad this movie is. Everyone involved in the production of this film, especially Uwe Boll, should be ashamed of themselves. Although what I have said may make 'House of the Dead' sound funny, it really isn't. Nothing about it is funny. Avoid this at all costs."
440,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"I couldn't leave this movie because there were people asleep either side of me and I'm not evil enough to wake them so that they are subjected to a single second more of this motion picture. I would gladly have beaten myself to death with my left arm if I thought I could get it out of the socket without waking people. I felt like one of those guys in the forties who was forced to sit and watch a nuclear explosion from behind a single pane of glass and, like those poor chaps, I believe that there is a pretty good chance that the after-effects of witnessing this film will be with me for years to come. I walked past a movie theatre recently and felt a shudder go down my spine. I haven't been to the cinema since and I'm not sure if I will be able to ever again. Uwe Boll believes he is a genius. He is not. He is waging a war on cinema, ethnically cleansing good character development, dialogue and continuity from the silver screen. He should be brought before a tribunal and locked up indefinit"

442,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"I'm trying to picture what went on in the boardroom when this film was greenlighted. With the success of Resident Evil fresh in the memory of Hollywood, someone obviously thought that films based on video games were now the in thing. Never mind, of course, that Resident Evil was given a halfway decent story, good realisation, and a credible cast. No, video game-based films are suddenly fashionable, so we don't need those things, right? Well, the four production companies behind this mess obviously thought so. They were wrong. Dead wrong, if you'll pardon the pun.

You might want to stop reading now if you want to be surprised by the incredible stupidity of this film. Anyway, our principal characters get an invite to some kind of party that is on an island that most mariners need to be paid incredible sums to think about visiting. The party organisers have transport, but it gets worse from this point.

What defies belief is that brief snippets of footage from the video game are inserted throughout the film. Yes, we know this dross is based on a video game, we don't need screenshots from said game to remind us of the fact. Another thing they copied from the video game was the convoluted excuse for the partygoers and other incredibly stupid specimens to be on the island. What's even more incredible is how the heroes suddenly display skills that the audience haven't been made privy to. Suddenly, the afro girl can do kung fu with the zombies, and the previously green partygoers are wielding swords. One of the girls can even sustain wounds that would be fatal to men who have spent most of their lives building their muscular system. Don't ask me how she does it. I'm sure even the writers in this case don't know.

A big part of the problem is that nothing shown in the film is given the appropriate level of setup. We don't know why these people are going to the island, smuggling things, or trying to arrest each other. They're just doing these incredibly stupid things. The dynamics of the zombies are not clearly defined, either. We're never given any explanation as to why they exist, or at least one that doesn't stretch credulity to breaking point. We get some drivel involving a Conquistador and some kind of experiment to prolong life, or something. Why anyone would have wanted to prolong their life in such a world begs for explanation. Explanation is apparently not in Uwe Boll's vocabulary.

Spare a thought for Jürgen Prochnow. Appearing in this kind of Z-grade dreck is one hell of a comedown for the man who played the captain in Das Boot, the yardstick by which all submarine films are judged. I know he must be desperate to appear in anything after Judge Dredd, but this is just silly.

I gave House Of The Dead a one out of ten. Don't mistake this to mean I think the film is bad enough to be good. It is so bad that it stops being good at about the halfway point and becomes excruciating. The only reason to watch it is for bragging rights in a contest to see who has watched the worst films."

I imagine that if I had ever seen all of the movies ever made in the world, this one would be tops for my favorites. This movie made Night of the Living Dead look like a humongous dog turd. I swear that Uwe Boll is a freaking genius. And if anybody were to take him up on his challenge, and punch him and hurt him, I would be honor-bound to hunt that person down and torture and kill him like the rabid dog he is. I hope that one day I'm able to create a Uwe Boll shrine, telling the whole world how great he is. If I were a woman, I would have his babies.

444,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"I want to tell you why this is a pretty kick ass movie. First off lets consider what the bare minimum we should expect out of a an entertaining horror movie: 1. Blood, 2. Boobs, 3. Beasts and this movie has all three in spades. The action scenes are hyper stylized yet original and interesting. The zombie effects are reminiscent of Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie"", plus they are practical effects, a super bonus considering many films, even those made in 2002 were relying far too heavily on cheap CGI effects. I will offer that some of the acting is pretty ridiculous at best but some performances including Clint Howard's are truly genre classic. Avoiding all story spoilers, as I think this film should be experienced in the purest way possible, I would like to point out overall the story moves at a brisk pace and never tests the audience in their patience.

445,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Wow, Uwe Boll has some learning to do. While I, as an avid gamer who see the potential of games turning into worthwhile movies, it pains me time and time again to see all of these franchises swirling down the toilet because some dumbass doesn't know how to adapt it the right way. Yeah, our expectations are high, but at least give it your all. This movie adds to the mindset of games' lack of adaptability. Granted he had no $$ for this movie, Boll is still green, and it shows(washes with game footage?). However, if you look at it - and this is going to sound really weird - as a B-movie to sit down and pop a few beers with, this ain't that bad of a movie to watch. At the very least, it can show what NOT to do with a film, or great fodder for a drinking game with your buddies. I'll admit that I own this movie and that I watch it on occasion (makes no sense huh). I guess it's my soft spot for B-movies. That said, this is by no means a good movie, or even an average one, but I've seen far worse (Mortal Kombat: Annihilation?) to label it with a lower rating than I gave "

This one had a minimal plot, cardboard characters and high school dialogue but I didn't come to watch ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe"" It had great visuals, an interesting northern Pacific rainforest set and plenty of firepower and a few good actors to keep the amateurs in line. The main action seen was great and very stylized and the cheap video game sequences were funny and underlined another zombie waste shot. It kept me interested in the next scene, waiting for an interesting head shot or a silly line.

448,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"I mean honestly, what were you expecting. It's a film titled House of the Dead. Based on a video game thats already out of date. With a low budget and no name actors. I know my expectations came no where near the top with this one and I was decently suprised. Is it a bad movie? Oh yes. But it's heart is in the right place. One thing for sure is that the filmmakers did a good job capturing the video games atmosphere. There are scenes incorpated into the film right from the game. As a long time game and genre fan I can appreciate the slight throwbacks to it's core audience. The film doesn't really represent any one of the games although I'm quite sure it acts as a prequel to them. The same way the infintely better Resident Evil did. it's about a supposed killer rave(That looks more like a ho down) on a island where the people are suddenly attacked buy a weirdos zombie experiments and turned into food for the fast and ever growing undead population. The film really is nothing more than that. There are some cool but overused camera techniques. Mostly stolen from other films but used in creative ways and some decent splatter fx accompanied with hilariously intentional and unintentional dialogue and scenes. Plus alot of unnecessary gratious nudity. So once again was this film bad? yes. Was it entertaining? damn right it was. It's a gutsy, gory little action horror flick made specifically for the fun of it! And if you see it as anything else well than the joke is on you."
449,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Going to a small island for a party, a group of revelers finds the entire area overrun by vicious flesh-eating zombies raised from the dead by a deadly chemical and must find a way of stopping the creatures and getting off the island alive.

This is an unfairly maligned zombie effort that has a lot going for it. One of the better features here is the rather impressive suspense built up here, whether done through the jungle location where it's all set up in the traditional gloomy, oppressive jungle shrubs that really give off a great vibe or the opening scenes of the chaos-riddled party that doesn't strike as being odd and off-the-wall enough to really warrant that kind of attention which pays off in a rather tense beginning. Compounding it all as well is the film's singular best quality in its relentless action that pretty much runs throughout the film as a whole, initially serving as the perfect payoff for the suspense-filled opening while offering up plenty of exciting moments. There's plenty of action here that starts off with the attacks in the forest filled with oncoming swarms of zombies that are appearing behind trees and underwater all along a rather fun and exciting series of chases and encounters. The main part of the excitement here is the centerpiece assault on the group as they race into the shack which is readily filled with tons of blasting gunshots, zombies heads blasts apart, limbs hacked off and martial arts moves all being utilized against the zombies in a delirious ten-minute plus sequence that also manages to feature tons of stunt-work and gory action to make for a spectacular highlight. Other big action scenes include the final battle in the house where the reanimated bodies all start coming back to life in the lab while the battle in the tunnel features some creepy zombie make-up and leads into the thrilling sword fight at the finale. Along with that fantastic zombie make-up and fun gore, these are enough to build this up against the few flaws here, which include the continuous video-game sequences in the middle of a random scene which is quite aggravating for the quantity of times its done and the selection of scenes it showcases. They're distracting, don't fit the tone of what's happening and seem to be done merely to placate fans of the game. The only other flaw here is the decision to utilize the running zombie tactics that's just completely unrelated to anything in the film that we're given as to the source of their resurrection. These here are the film's only real flaws that hold it down.

Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity, and drug use."
450,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Okay, this movie was just terrible. Uwe Boll is the worst director to ever exist. Bad acting, bad story, bad make-up, bad cinematography, etc. Let's just say there was not one single thing about this movie that was good.

First of all, what the hell was the deal with the 'zombies'? They were gargoyles with glow-in-the-dark red eyes.. zombies don't look like that. Those things were the least scary things I've ever seen in my entire life. I'd be more afraid of a dandelion stem than I would the ""zombies"" in this movie.

The acting was so bad, even worse than the worst you've seen in any other B movie. It was so bad, that it wasn't even funny. Sometimes, in B movies, the acting is really cheesy which makes it funny. The acting in this movie was far beyond that. It was just BAD.

And, that's what's just sad. The incredibly cheesy video games are better in every way than the terrible movie. The acting, story, etc. are all lame and cheesy, but FAR better than the schlock in this waste of film. Even the pixelated, cartoonish zombies look so much more realistic than the black, red-eyed Swamp Thing ""zombies"" in this movie.

How the hell does Uwe Boll keep getting work? He continues his streak of destroying video game franchises, most recently with Bloodrayne, and now I hear he's doing Hit-man, and more.

Hey, Hollywood.. WHY DO YOU KEEP HIRING THIS GUY TO DIRECT?! His movies are the worst ever made in history, and they make NO MONEY. Seriously, somebody needs to kick this jackass out of the film industry."
451,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Uwe Boll, the master of trash strikes again and he strikes hard. This film is an excellent example of what happens when business majors start making movies. Scenes thrown together on a whim, blatant disregard for continuity, a meaningless, pathetically dim witted plot executed with more attention to useless, overdone effects at the expense of cohesive film-making and a suspenseful story. This movie has so many editing mistakes, such a lame direction that it goes beyond words to describe. Boll truly gives directors a bad name!

And what the hell is Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot, Beverly Hills Cop 2, Air Force One) doing in there? How he has fallen! The one, sole, only good thing about this film is actress Ona Grauer who plays the heroine, she at lest provides some eye candy.

I hope Uwe Boll keeps making movies for the rest of his life, so that I can die laughing. Never have I seen such a funny movie. The plot was horrible to say the least.

457,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"In the 'Island of the Dead', a group of teenagers arrives for a rave party organized by some friends of them. They find the place completely empty and discover that the island is full of zombies. They escape to an abandoned house, where they meet the rest of the group, and they discover that a Spanish priest from centuries ago made experiences with dead persons, trying to keep immortal. 'House of the Dead' is silly, has many flaws in the screenplay, but it does not deserve to be among the 'Bottom 100'. It is watchable and laughable of many situations, and I found it a good entertainment. There are some sequences of 'Halloween' and 'Friday 13th ' much worse than 'House of the Dead' which are not listed in the 'Bottom 100'. My vote is five.

458,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Uwe Boll enjoys something of a reputation on the Internet as one of the worst directors in existence; a modern-day Ed Wood, if you will, incapable of making produce that's not completely terrible in every sense. For me, though, such descriptions are unfair to Ed Wood, whose films were at the very least entertaining. HOUSE OF THE DEAD is nothing like; it's an awful film and even worse than the previous Boll film I watched, ALONE IN THE DARK.

An erstwhile adaptation of the popular arcade game, this is a traditional zombie film which sees a group of unwary ravers falling foul of some zombies that emerge from the depths of the ocean to wreak havoc upon the living. So far, so B-movie, but the direction and technical values are of such an appalling quality that even the most generous of movie buffs will struggle to enjoy this. Desperate attempts to interest viewers, such as the gratuitous nudity, fail to work, leaving this a train wreck of a film.

Incredibly, Boll gets everything wrong at every point. The decision to include actual clips of the video game is stupid in the extreme. His direction is rubbish, as is the acting, even from seasoned genre veterans like Jurgen Prochnow and Clint Howard. The effects are poor and although the film contains non-stop action, it's thoroughly dull because said action is so poorly staged. Dull, dull, dull and silly throughout, comic book in style but lacking the energy and excitement of a comic book adaptation. The worst zombie movie ever made? Quite possibly, even with all the silly Italian zombie flicks out there."
459,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"I had heard much about this film, most of it bad. But I wanted to see it for myself. I wish I hadn't. There may be some novelty value in its awfulness but apart from that House of the Dead is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. It looks cheap, with fake-looking gore and terrible effects. Not to mention that it is like the third film I've seen in a row with some of the worst camera work I've ever seen in any movie. The lighting is ineffective also, even for a movie of this genre it is too austere, and the scenery I just couldn't enjoy as a result. The music is loud and over-bearing, starting sluggish in tempo and then rushing on for no real reason. The script is full of overlong and quite frankly lazy exposition, repetitive rhetoric and dialogue that comes across as hackneyed and trite. The pop culture references especially feel thrown in and add absolutely nothing to the actually non-existent atmosphere The story is a mess, what there is is predictable and lethargic with nothing standing out as scary or suspenseful, a lot of it reads of a rambling music video with a cheap attempt to evoke some horror. The direction is incompetent, not surprising considering it's Uwe Boll, whose reputation for making bad movies is notorious. The characters are stereotypical, have absolutely no depth to them and are not likable at all, more annoying above all else. The acting ranges from bland to irritating, nothing better. There are some nice-looking people that unfortunately can't do anything with what they've been given. All in all, simply terrible, a must avoid if preferable. 1/10 Bethany Cox"
460,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"ONE BAD THING: This movie has the notable distinction of being truly awful. Uwe Boll firmly establishes his legacy as the worst film maker since Ed Wood. If you don't believe me, do a web search on his name and look for the petitions to force him to stop working.

ANOTHER BAD THING: This movie is so poorly conceived and executed that it not only notoriously splices clips of the original video game source material into the live action footage, but also accidentally reveals the device used to launch actors during an explosion made famous by the ""A-Team.""

EVEN ANOTHER BAD THING: This flick gives zombies a bad name. By relying on the undead as nothing more than monster targets for shotgun blasts, the movie never delves into issues of mindlessness and animal-like behavior explored by better film makers (see: ""Dawn of the Dead"" or ""28 Days/Weeks Later"").

ONE GOOD THING: Featuring perennial horror favorites Jurgen Prochnow and Clint Howard; as well as, atrocious dialog and attractive women in revealing situations, the movie is ripe for drinking games and ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" type commentary.

OVERALL GRADE: F

463,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Okay, for those of you thinking this is going to be a brilliant adaption of The House Of The Dead game trilogy, don't. This film is about as relevant to the game as Pee-Wee's Playhouse. The plot is that a couple of beer drinking, sex-crazed teens (not an uncommon factor in horror these days) go to a remote island for a rave only to find out that for no noted reason zombies start attacking them! This has little relevance to the game that was about a pair of government agents are called in to investigate disappearances at an abandoned mansion when they run into the zombies. At the end of the game you find that it is a 'pyramid scheme' by the games bad guy Goldman. This movie couldn't have stepped away from the game any further, most of the action happens away from the house on the island. It is a disappointment to know that film makers try to base films on popular games without taking into consideration what the hell the plot was! Do not see this film, the acting is wooden, the action is stale and the frequent cuts to screen shots of the game get excessively irritating. House Of The Dead is horror for 12 year old."

The shoot'm up zombie fest with loud teenage almost rap and Matrix stills buy the score was fun. But it does stand as a particularly bad thing for Jurgen Prochnow - he had to play the skipper to Ronnie Hopward's brother's Gilligan.

But hey - what do you expect in a Zombie movie - they can't all be Dawns and Shauns. I guess you look for the gang of quietly sticky zombies accidentally some poor lamb of a human - usually looking the wrong way for suspense. Well these zombies where a bit louder and they seemed to seek prey, but there were Grade A Hollywood tits all over the house and proudly displayed - so I gotta give back a point or two if you see it ""au natural"" - but if you see it with the tits hacked out for TV - then you have a 3."

When I went to see this movie, the whole theater was full. People started leaving after the first 10 minutes. By the movie's end, there might have been 10 people left. My friend Matt and I were two of those people. One of the major reasons we stayed was to see how far into th movie each person in the theater could force themselves to sit through. This resulted in one of the most enjoyable film experiences of my life.

People have always told me that to get the full enjoyment out of ""Freddy Got Fingered,"" I should only slightly pay attention to the film. To enjoy it, my main focus should be on the audience reactions. This is exactly how I feel about ""House of the Dead.""

There are two kinds of bad movies: 1. The terrible kind that bore the heck out of you and make you fall asleep and 2. The kind that is just soooooo stupid that it's actually funny.

For me, House of the Dead was the second choice. I admit that it was really, really stupid. But I had a great time laughing through the whole thing.

473,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"I had no idea this was based on a video game until I started watching it. So I guess I'm not included in the video game fan category for this movie.

I'm not one to give away any of the plot, and basically you don't need to know about the plot to see a zombie flick, but the zombies in this movie are not generic randomly raised zombies. There's a possibility that some of these zombies are 400-500 years old.

The zombies in this movie do not need to be shot in the head to be killed. Unlike older traditional zombie flicks, these zombies move quick (like in 28 Days later) but are quite a bit more methodical. As well they can use melee weapons. Certainly some of the most vicious zombies around.

Ona Grauer was overwhelmingly sexy throughout the film. Jürgen Prochnow is excellent in his role. Ellie Cornell didn't seem comfortable in her role, but it doesn't take away from the movie and she did well in the action scenes. Clint Howard played his part well, and while the character was somewhat useful in the plot (certainly the whistling scenes were good additions), the character was mostly annoying (likely a writer/director flaw, not the actor's). The others were all quite adequate and each had something good to add to the flick. They should all be able to get more work easily.

It's no blockbuster but is certainly an entertaining zombie flick. A bunch of nobodies become excellent zombie destroyers. It has some really nifty clips that circle the characters which was very well done (and hopefully not overly copied into other movies like the Matrix effect).

The action clips were far more realistic than most modern action movies. Slow motion dodges by the martial artist actually followed the rules of physics and weren't done with any big special effects (No running up trees here or ridiculous bending over backwards so your head can tap the floor and back up). The stop action and slow-motion was very well placed and not overused.

There are numerous video game clips in the movie which sorely take away from the movie and were a really bad idea. As well the narration isn't spoken clearly. Oh,and don't count the bullets fired - they won't add up.

Certainly this movie has more energy and flow then most zombie movies. It doesn't have much creepiness though. This is more of a fun zombie action movie than a horror flick.Think of it as the first Resident Evil without the slower spots. This is pretty non-stop action.

From a mainstream movie point of view, there will be some silly aspects to this movie, but from a B-Movie-Zombie-flick point of view, it should be in any zombie collection.

The actual premise and deeper plot of the movie has quite a bit of potential. Certainly more could have been made with the plot, but it was fun nevertheless.

This movie is INCREDIBLY bad!!!! ALL the acting is lousy--I mean EVERYBODY!!!! There's not one good performance at all! Also, one of the guys is described as being very handsome and being an underwear model. He's not handsome and (very obviously) is not in great shape. They even cast the roles wrong!!!

The movie does deserve some credit--within the first 15 minutes we see two topless women--one of them at great length. Needless to say it has nothing to do with the plot.

Oh--and the ""plot""! What little there is completely disappears by the last half hour. At that point they're all baricadded in a house with the zombies all outside trying to get in. What happens? Out of nowhere, one of the women finds a book and says ""This is book is pretty old. Maybe it can help us."" (????!!!!!?????) WHAT THE F***! At that point I almost left. When a movie is insulting me like that... Really crappy zombie makeup too. They only show it in flashes...for good reason. When you get a clear view at the end it's laughable. And what the hell is the point of showing video game killings every once in a while? Yes...we KNOW it's based on a video game...you don't have to keep reminding us!

Still, I sort of ""enjoyed"" it. It was so bad in every department it was amusing to watch (kind of). Also there's plentiful gore with some nice shots of heads exploding (the MPAA must have been asleep when they rated this one) and there's a (I swear) 10-15 minute non-stop massacre sequence in the middle that is both incredibly gory and hysterically funny (the director slows motion down at random and stops it to circle every single character...WHY???????). This is a perfect party movie. Rent it and you'll have the room laughing in minutes.

So, let's get this out of the way. Uwe Boll's House of the Dead lives up to the hype. It really is the worst (zombie) movie ever made. I cannot stress that enough really...it IS pure crap. Honestly, the only thing this movie is good for is unintentional laughs or a good nap. I found myself dozing off in a few of the action scenes as they were just plain boring. (And for some reason I decided to rewind some of them to see if I missed out on storywhoops! Bad mistake there)! The acting is atrocious, the score is beyond annoying (seriously, techno beats throughout the whole movie??), the story is almost non-existent, the characters are unbelievable and unlikeable (we get nil development and all stupidity) and the special effects are appalling.

For those who have no idea what House of the Dead is about, it is only fair to fill you in. Based off the popular rail-shooting arcade games, this follows a group of teens who are trying to get to a rave on an island. They miss their scheduled boat by 15 minutes, so they pay a smuggler to take them there. Upon arrival, they discover everyone is gone and the place is trashed. Do they leave? Nope, they stay for the free beer and to wander around in groups. They soon discover the island is infested with zombies, so they take refuge in a house and try survive the night.

I do not know what could have been going through Boll's brain (if it exists) when he was making this. Shouldn't a smart, normal human realise they are making a bad movie when your teenage ravers can shoot shotguns, desert eagles and sub-machine guns with 100% precision and accuracy? Oh, and they can also perform high level martial arts! Shouldn't an intelligent man know its a bad movie when your action scenes directly rip-off ""The Matrix"" with poor CGI and dodgy slo-mo? Finally, how the holy $#*& can someone think inserting game footage into the movie makes it better? I am not joking when I say this, Boll actually includes numerous clips from the game during the action scenes and even includes a Game Over screenshot when one of the ravers dies! House of the Dead is consistently good at being absolute trite. With zombies that look identical (and are able to swim, sword-fight and get angered by breaking tanks full of red water), with bullets igniting barrels of gunpowder and with the power to get stabbed and die, but get up and crush a zombie's head only to die again, Uwe Boll has successfully created the most idiotic film in history. The movie is funny, though, and many could find joy at laughing at the many plot holes and clichés abundant throughout. Moreover, the random nudity may please some Congratulations, Mr. Boll, you have managed to rape what could have been at least a mediocre movie! 0/5"

485,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Okay, lets start with the good stuff. Tons of violence and some pretty gory scenes, i enjoyed some of it and this is kind of like an action movie. Now for the bad. Uwe BOll directed it, begins with two minutes of clips from the game, literally gave me a headache and then it showed something that seemed to have absolutely nothing to do with the movie or maybe i wasn't paying attention. THere is a lot of bubbling water for on this island and you start to wonder why there would be a rave party on this island. The film is called ""House of the dead"" and based on some great arcade games, but they appear to only be in the house for about a half hour of the movie and remember those dogs that jump out of the fountain and attack you before you get into the mansion in the games? well, they are nowhere to be seen, nor are the guys running around with chainsaws that look like leatherface, and there isn't a gargoyle like thing anywhere. They could've just called it ""Island of doom"". The film had some ""scary"" scenes before the violence started but then it was all violence with heads being blown up and all that crap. There were girls that used their fists and feet to kill a bunch of zombies, the zombies also died from one bullet to the chest and could jog. The game is about zombie hunters, this is about teens and a coast guard and a crazy fisherman with a crapload of guns all stuck together on an island that is filled with zombies. One of the only things they did right was the ""boss fight"" at the end when they fought the king zombie, the good guys had an axe and he had a sword, not at all like the game but okay. These teens were too good at avoiding zombies and killing them as they had good aim with the guns, could dodge sword attacks and could kill them with their bare hands. In the last fight, the girl is stabbed and falls dramatically then gets up two minutes later as her friend is being strangled by the zombie and then she finishes it off and they live happily ever after. some mindless crap is involved in this movie and the sequel is less violent, but has some suspenseful elements and is actually in the college campus for the whole movie, with the exception of a few scenes building up to it in the beginning, that one had the zombie hunters and none of it was mindless gore. See the sequel and you can skip this one unless your looking for a nice piece of trash to watch on a Saturday night."

488,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Sometimes a movie is so bad, it's good. HOTD is not one of these movies. It's so bad, you'll feel ashamed and dirty all over after the entire affair (assuming you don't turn this off 10 minutes into it).

I had VERY low expectations for this movie. A trailer and teaser came on my Xbox version of House of the Dead 3. It looked pretty bad already, and a teaser is supposed to show all the good bits and make you want to go to theatres. This trailer definitely didn't, so you know you're in trouble as a film maker. It looked like a crappy costume party in the woods, or a high school film student's work. I finally saw it a few days ago to see why everyone hated it so much. Hard as it is to believe, this movie goes way below my worst expectations and even the harshest reviews aren't harsh enough. It's more horrible than I could have ever imagined. Every possible facet of this movie so completely bad! It defies belief that a man can be so stupid.

Sometimes critics have subjective reasons for disliking a film. There is no room for subjectivity here. This movie is an unequivocal and irrefutable heap of steaming turd. Uwe Boll, how can you sleep at night?! Shame on you and everyone associated with this abomination of celluloid garbage. Jurgen Prochnow of Das Boot fame, how low you've sunk!! Canadian punk singer Bif Naked just lost all points for her cameo.

There is nothing redeeming about this movie, unless you count the fact that we see 2 examples of boobage in the first 10 minutes. Never mind the fact that Boll took the name of the game literally and actually made a house of the dead in the wood... Everything about this movie is idiotic. Characters with weapons at the ready stand doing nothing, looking like morons as their friends get chomped by zombies. Boll does the Matrix spin with EVERY character as they fire off their weapon. Lame. The makeup is horrible. Acting is horrible.. The game had plenty of source material and bad guys to choose from. It could've been a great action, sci-fi/horror film in the vein of Resident Evil (which was mediocre as a film, but Oscar gold compared to this monstrosity).

If you like torture, watch this movie. I suggest Drain-o if you really want to kill yourself. It's much quicker."

game spin offs have never been the be all and end all of movies but this could have been fun.a haunted house movie with zombies and huge bosses.no Shakespeare but mindless fun non the less.

they had no idea what they were doing whilst making this. it looks like it was made by a 12 year old who loves games, monsters and tits. and uses these three ingredients in every scene.

in between these scenes they even add a grainy screen shot of the game.

the acting is horrible, clint howard gets the award for terrible over acting of the year, get back on gentle ben sunny jim

anyone who gets a job after this travesty deserves a medal.

in one word this film is turd."
492,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"The only horror to this movie is that it was unleashed on the public. I knew before I watched it that it was going to be a bad movie. I knew that movies based on video games very rarely translate well to movies, and I had heard that this was a stinker among stinkers. Somehow, Uwe Boll managed to lower the bar right to the ground. Ignore ANY review of this movie that is not a 1 (unless someday they let you choose 0).

Horrible acting. Cheesy effects. No story.

No matter how bad you think I'm telling you this movie is, it's worse than you are expecting.

Edit: After further reading and comtemplation, I wanted to express a little more about this movie.

First, there are people that have stated this movie does not belong in the bottom 100 movies. I'm not sure how they can make that an argument for grading this movie higher than it is really worth. Have they actually seen every single movie listed? I know I haven't. I don't care where my rating of this movie makes it fall in some list. All I can tell you is that the movie does not even deserve its current, artificially inflated, score.

Second, the ONLY people that should view this film are film students. I think this movie would make an excellent educational tool for first-year film students so that they can get a VERY clear idea of what NOT to do.

Finally, thinking more about the content of the movie, the best way to describe it is if you put a 9-year old at the helm. Imagine a young person spewing out, ""You know what would be cool?! That spinning camera effect from The Matrix! And little clips of the video game! Oh, Oh! And a weapons dealer! That would be so cool!"" Essentially, that is what this movie is. The unedited ""cool"" list of a 9-year old. The problem is, the movie has nudity and extreme violence, so no 9-year old should ever see this movie."

494,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Imagine a group of adolescent geeks decided to make a movie ""inspired"" by their favorite video game. Then imagine that they secured financing by agreeing to turn their epic into a 90 minute commercial for the game.

We know we're in trouble when a giant SEGA banner fills the frame early on in what passes for ""the story."" But the stomach chunks don't really start blowing until the action intensifies and -- shazaam! -- we are blasted by the editor from the derivatively staged cinematic action directly into snippets of the video game.

It occurred to me halfway through this stinker that it was about as much fun as watching a couple of friends play a video game. But minutes later I realized that it wasn't even that much fun. In this case, the player is the director, and his directorial choices stank like baked ass.

The writers deserve their share of the credit as well. To say the characters are one dimensional would be generous. My guess is that no one involved in this movie had ever seen a horror movie, let alone could pass as a fan. It has all the hallmarks of pretension one could expect from creators who are slumming in the genre.

There is one bright moment early on, when a nubile beauty takes a topless swim. For one teasing moment it seems that we're about to be thrust into a retro horrorsploitation flick, the kind of no holds barred teen hormone catalyzer they used to make before ""Scream"" laid the future foundation for a kinder, gentler, more pc kind of horror flick.

But that moment passes quickly, and the mess that follows is a chore to endure. The zombies are as uninteresting as the rest of the cast. (Note to Jurgen: get a new agent! Fast!) The ""kids"" in this movie run the full gamut from underacting to overacting. In their defense, it's probable that the producers and director were following an agenda to target this movie to ten-year-old game fans, so any acting which might have led to actual scares or suspense was probably actively squelched.

Clint Howard in Gorton Fisherman drag stands out. As demented and lopsidedly comedic as his character is, at least there's a spark of life in him.

The zombies attack. Guns start blazing. The soundtrack kicks in with what can only be tagged ""trance hop."" Too leaden and simple-minded to be trip hop, it amps up the monotony factor tenfold. When the editor isn't lopping in ill-advised bits of pixelated game action, the director is injecting slow-motion whirly-whirl nuggets which instantly remind the viewer that the Matrix did it first, and did it in a much smarter context.

If you're tempted to rent this, pick up ""House of 1000 Corpses"" instead. Even if you've already seen it."
495,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"The House of the Dead is a lackluster attempt to capitalize on the huge success of the classic zombie-bashing House of the Dead video game by Sega Inc. Sure, if you are an inexperienced directing and writing team, you can point at the success of Resident Evil (Resident Evil 2 forthcoming) and Mortal Kombat movies. I'll bet the project was further justified by the huge revenue generated by this title for game systems and in the arcade. However, unlike RE and MK, HofD is merely a button- mashing or trigger-pulling video game. The game lacks storyline depth and this movie does as well. The problem is that a video game is a video game and a movie is a movie, period!!! For example, one of the zombie-killing scenes in the movie goes on and on and on, while characters twirl in circles waiting to be your chosen player for game play. The problem is you're not playing a video game, next scene please. Why are people kissing in this movie when the writers didn't develop the characters or the storyline enough to justify such nonsense. Makes me wonder-How could the teen-slasher formula be so badly interpreted? Sega logos in the background?, it's not a commercial. Special features? pure space-fillers. For example, why would the women of HofD need to train to kill zombies, when even in the movie they are simply pulling the trigger. What a joke!!! SEGA's apparent motto--LETS GET OUR NAME OUT THERE IN A MOVE, WE'RE SEGA. If you want to waste time rent this movie, if not, most of the other horror movies in the horror section of the video store are better than this, even the mindless slashers."

Absolutely the worst cheesy acting not to mention the worst make up ever put on film.( note to the director Walmart doesn't make good Halloween makeup seem scary sorry) The only Thing scary about this movie is how anyone good sit through this entirely. How could the director be so stupid not to notice how crappy this movie is. First off in the zombie scenes u can see normal people just walking around in the background not to mention when the actors walk by a zombie he actually moves his arm so they didn't step on him.

It's a real basic Zombie movie, 1/2 ""City Of The Dead"", 1/2 ""Zombie"", plotwise, but when is that important in this sort of thing? The visual approach is stupidly inventive with the use of video-game sequences (this can't have been on the burner since the game was popular!?), and crudely derivative for it's fake ""Matrix"" sequences. Lots of shooting, without much effect, accompanied by similarly useless grunting. The acting is really no worse than we should expect, Clint Howard & Jurgen Prochnow are fun to watch (Prochnow looks like he's trying to channel Robert Shaw, from ""Jaws""), and, though the gore might be a little light, it delivers what it promises.

I do not say weak character. All roles seem to have multi-personality. Sometimes so coward, sometime heroic, sometime melancholic... *yuck* 3. Irrational.

Not unlike the method employed by Bruno Mattei in Hell of the Living Dead with stock footage of native tribes and wildlife. As much of a hack work Hell of the Living Dead is, it's a masterpiece compared to House of the Dead. Tired cinematography reused under the guise of a fresh hip living dead movie.

House of the Dead is the most ridiculous movie I've ever had the pleasure of mocking. So much is wrong with this movie, I don't even know where to begin.

These kids all go to an island for a rave, get there and the place has been ransacked and there are no people anywhere. Is there one shred of concern for the missing partygoers by the latecomers? Not a bit. As a matter of fact, when zombies start killing people off, there's even less concern. The performances of the young actors are flat and uninspiring, you don't have any sympathy for their plight. The main 'ghoul' in the film doesn't even show up until the very end and what could have been an interesting plot is a ludicrous script with flashes of video game imagery and lots of firepower.

The entire time the outnumbered partiers are racing about trying to escape this Godforesaken flick, not one tear is shed or one genuine scream released. If zombies were chasing you, I think you'd care just a wee bit more about the reality of your situation. One dramatic scene comes when the policewoman has her legs chewed off by zombies while the male lead is dragging her through a window. He offers a half-assed guilty speech on the uselessness of his lifesaving effort. Maybe his performance falls on its face because the rest of the material is so sucky, but really the speech comes too late for anyone to care.

Do not spend any money to see this film. Do not wait for it on cable because you'll never get those 90 minutes of your life back. If you want to see an effective zombie flick, you're better off with 28 Days Later or one of the classics such as 'Dawn of the Dead'.

How can I sum this pile of excrement? Let's see........ 1.The actors here make the Friday the 13th actors look like Oscar Winners. 2. It's slow, boring, and it takes way too long to get to the gore and carnage. 3. During the ""orgy fight between human and the dead"", you hear a rap song repeat the lyrics over and over. You'd swear your ears are hallucinating.....but they're not. 4. I love Horror films, but calling this one a ""Horror"" film can only be true if you make reference to the amount of time you are wasting your life with this film.

521,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Just like everybody else have said, the acting is awful, no story or whatsoever, poor directing. About the SFX, the 360 degree, matrix style shooting, 1 shoot is stupid enough, but for each characters. I mean come on gimme a break. And what's up with all those video game scenes, just to remind us it's a ""video game adaptation""? Jesus, they should have fired whoever think up this idea.

0.0000"
522,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"A friend told me about this film and I thought ""cool!"" I'm a fan of the game like many others and I was excited at the prospect of seeing it turned into a film. I mean, they managed it with Resident Evil, so this should be just as good, right?

Wrong.

There is no story to begin with. It's your basic people-trapped-on-an-island-government-conspiracy trash. It's clear how the director felt though ""we have no story, but get enough breasts on screen and noone will notice"" I mean the chest shots are gratuitous to say the least, and y'know that's the norm with most horror films, but can't we have some sort of attempt at a story? And the acting! The zombies move just like those grey things from the Power Rangers TV series. It's really pretty difficult to tell the zombies from the non-zombies, everyone has the same dull tone when they read their lines. Actually, come to think of it, the zombies are generally far more active and enthusiastic than their supposedly human counterparts.

The special effects are absolutely laughable, they really should have invested in some digital effects for this one, the latex body gear is so naff! I was shocked and stunned when I found out that the film really was made in 2003, I thought it had to be an early 90s flick at least for that low a standard of FX.

The ending is a kick in the teeth. A helicopter lands, picks up the last two victims, some government types mill around and do the whole ""we're in charge thing"" albeit unbelievably half-heartedly, a few lame lines are exchanged and then its off to a shot of the sea and the hero repeating a lame soliloquy about how awful it all was. ...I must say, I agree with him entirely on that point.

Sega really shot themselves in the foot by plastering their name all over this picture.

In short, I want 90 minutes of my life back!"
523,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Of all genres the horror film is the one that where no matter how bad the film may, a viewer can usually get some thrills or can revel in the campy badness of a particular work. This makes almost all horror films ultimately watchable. House of the Dead disproves this theory. The fact that it is based on a video game is no excuse. Every element - the plot, the casting, the special effects even the music is off the mark. They seem to be shooting for a 1990's Scream/Scream 2 ironic slasher style with your generic 20-somethings wandering around on a haunted island waiting to be finished off by some zombies that look like rejects from the Michael Jackson Thriller video. The fight scenes are interminable, excrutiating and sleep inducing. At times for no reason frames from the actual video game are inserted into the action scenes (Is this supposed to affect us sublimnally and make us run out to buy the game?) Maybe in about 40 years time this film will have the retro trash appeal of something like Attack of the Giant Leeches, but I found it to be a tough movie to sit thro"
524,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"The title, really really bad, is an under-statement. It really sucked, I actually thought about demanding a refund at the theatre. There isn't much else to say besides that it really really sucked, bad. I don't recommend anyone ever to watch this mo"
525,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Okay, let me start off by saying that nothing in this will come as a surprise to anyone who's read the other comments. That being said, MY G-D, THIS MOVIE REEKED! I mean, WOW, I didn't know it was possible to throw as much money as they obviously did at something and still come out worse than ANY Roger Corman movie! Corman was probably pitched this movie at some point but declined due to the poor quality of the script! The only reason this movie got made in the first place is that someone said, 'Hey, Zombies are popular. Video games are popular. What game can we get a hold of that has zombies in it? Resident Evil? No, someone else got there first. Silent Hill? No, too silent. People will never sit in a dark room just to be scared silly. Hey, didn't Sega have a game where people ran around shooting zombies? They're out of the platform biz, we could get that for pennies!'

Basically they tried their best to make a movie that felt like the video game, even down to shooting the combat as if the characters were actually playing the game.

The first and major problem is that the original game was horrid. I mean,

bad-movie-merchandising-made-into-a-worse-game-in-two-weeks-and-then-shippe d-out-and-bought-by-morons-and-their-parents-for-christmas horrid. The graphics were boring. The monsters were boring. The levels were boring. The interface was boring. The CASE was boring. In other words, this was a boring game. And that was the ARCADE version. The home version was even worse! With the home version, you didn't even get the shotgun to hold in your hand while you were being bored silly by this pointless game! But I digress.

The second problem is that they went so far as to actually intercut scenes from actual gameplay during the fight scenes. HUH??? Didn't the editor have enough confidence in the effects to indicate that there was an actual fight going on? Not to mention that EVERY fight was shot from the perspective of a video game, which may explain the tedious use of Matrix-style effects. The problem with this is that the game was a first-person shooter (the player proceeds from the POV of the character). Maybe that's why they put in the game graphics, to let you know that they were alluding to the game... Right, whatever...

Anyway, the only thing that made this ENTIRE experience remotely enjoyable was the fact that everyone in the theatre was making fun of the movie out loud, so my sudden fits of hysterical laughter and general incredulity were taken as commonplace and didn't get me kicked out.

To sum up, DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE! Don't even deign to rent it when it comes out on video in a couple of week. Run. Just run."

I watch alot of Hong Kong ninja movies that are basically the result of an unfinished Japanese police drama having footage of ninjas inserted at the end to create something that could technically be called ""a movie.""

House of the Dead is however one of the worst films I've ever seen at the theatres. Walking out half way through, I actually felt I was somewhat dumber for having set through 45 minutes of this piece of garb"
529,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"I have never seen a worse movie.

It is possible to take a shootem up video game and make it into a decent movie.

Mistake 1: absolutely no connection to any of the characters. In this movie you don't bond with any of the characters because... you don't get a chance.

The only character that is sympathetic or even interesting is the Deck Hand: Salish as played by Clint Howard. Except for this unique character, the outcome of the movie is meaningless as all the characters were lifeless from the begining.

Mistake 2: the worst gunfight scene ever. I love gunfights. I love when the heros open up on the badguys and clean house. heck I even like to watch a badguy clean house sometimes. But this gunfight was weird I guess that the best way to describe it is ""Apathetic"" I've seen people shoot with more feeling and emotion while PLAYING THE VIDEOGAME. In this movie it looked and felt like the ""Actors"" were simply walking through shooting everything that moved without emotion.

Why? Where's the trash talking? where's the snarls of rage amongst the gunfire? These are supposed to be kids that got caught at a rave gone bad... but even real soldiers acting professionally and ruthlessly show their humanity.

If you want a GOOD horror movie about a secluded house full of monsters, I recomend Sam Rami's Evil Dead series. DO NOT see the disaster that is house of the dead. I hope that they burn the master and all copies of this movie."
530,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"For everyone that has seen House of the Dead and was upset by how bad the writing was but enjoyed all the references to other Zombie movies, you have to thank Mr. Dave Parker for that. He was the one that put all the other references in there. This movie was actually written a lot better but Hollywood and the other writer changed a bunch of things and ruined what could have been a brilliant script for this movie. If you want to see what a truly talented writer and director can do, watch the Dead Hate the Living, Dave's first attempt at writing and directing a movie. I must say it is one of the best movie's Full Moon has ever put out. In the meantime, take it for what it's worth, a B movie released by Hollywood which I will personally see a bunch of times.

531,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"The House of the Dead COULD have been a really good, really scary movie. The story was there. The location was there. I'll even venture so far as to say that the directing potential was there. HOWEVER, this movie was a complete and total piece of c**p. As a true fan of horror, it actually hurts me to have to say that, but I can't even pretend like this was a good film. I'll give the actors the benefit of the doubt and not say that they were bad because the script was so COMPLETELY awful, they really had nothing at all to work with. Whoever wrote the asinine script should be permanently banned from Hollywood. I mean, really: WHO WROTE THIS AND WHAT EVER MADE THEM THINK THEY HAD THE ABILITY TO WRITE IN THE FIRST PLACE? My only answer is that it must have been written by a couple of 13 year olds who skipped every English class they ever had. In virtually EVERY scene, I was forced to listen to the characters state (in surprised tones) things that were so totally obvious, I began to wonder if maybe they weren't supposed to be blind. At least that would have explained their need to do this. For example, when the surviving members of the group take shelter in the basement of the house, one character says ""Where the Hell are we?"" and another replies ""We must be in some sort of catacombs beneath the house."" Well, THANK YOU for pointing that out as I am just not smart enough to see that for myself. The descent through the floor and down stairs did absolutely NOTHING to help me understand that on my own. I will give the film one positive point: it was visually interesting to watch with some very enthusiastically filmed action scenes (even if they were more than just a little reminiscent of The Matrix). However, even these scenes couldn't save the film as they always tended to drag on for about 10 minutes longer than necessary.

I wanted this film to be good and for the first few minutes, you actually think it will be. After that, it falls completely apart. Imagine everything about this movie that could have been bad and you can bet on the fact that it did in fact happen

If you want to see this, wait for it to come to DVD although whether or not this film is worth seing at all is VERY debatable!"

I will give the actors the benefit of the doubt and not say they were bad because honestly they had what may well be the worst dialogue EVER written to work with. I'm pretty sure my cat could have written a better script. Whoever DID write this used an alias if they knew what wass good for them because they deserve to be banned from Hollywood...forever. TO illustrate just how BAD this stuff was, consider the following example: Upon escaping into the basement of the house, one charachter says: ""Where in the Hell are we?"" and the other replies: ""we must be in some type of catacombs beneath the house."" Well, THANK YOU for pointing that out as I am much to stupid to realize that the opening of a door located on the floor and a subsequent descent of a flight of stairs could POSSIBLY mean something without having a charachter verbally verify things. I will give the film one thing: It has some excellent (if blatantly ripped from THe Matrix) fighting scenes but even these are not enough to save the film as they always lasted at least 10 minutes too long.

It would have taken nothing more than a few minor changers to vastly increase the overall film.

533,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"When ""Resident Evil"" came out a few years ago, many people

thought that the idea of a movie based on a video game would not

work (ie. ""Super Mario Bros."") It was released, it did moderately

well at the box office, and it wasn't horrible. After seeing ""House of

the Dead"", I wish ""Resident Evil"" had failed miserably so they

never would have made this garbage. This is a movie containing

""the rave of the year"" consisting of 25 kids and a VOLLEYBALL

NET! This is a movie containing long, drawn-out backstories for

characters who will die in the next scene. This is a movie

containing a ship captain who actually licks his finger and holds it

up to the air to see if a storm is coming. Some of the zombies look

good, some look like people who wandered on to the set and had

really bad acne. This is one of those movies where they try to

combine too many styles. I can just imagine the pitch meeting...

""It's 'The Matrix' meets 'Night of the Living Dead' meets 'The Island

of Dr. Moreau' meets 'Melrose Place!'"" The movie itself references

at least a dozen other movies, and you wish that you were

watching any one of them. Ironically, most theatres are

programming the ""Resident Evil 2"" trailer with ""House of the

Dead."" The trailer is clever and funny. It's about sixty seconds

long. That minute is better than any one in the movie you are

about to see."
534,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Eek!!!!! This is the very first time I've made a review on a pure horror movie, and boy, what a spooky horror movie it is! Of course, there's ""Manos: The Hands of Fate,"" which is also a horror film; however, ""Manos"" was more of a comedy and a disaster rather than a really spooky horror film (because the man had no budget, the plot and story was weak, etc.) However, thanks to my handy-dandy-trusty calculating device of mine, $7,000,000 (how much it cost to make ""House of the Dead"") divided by a measly little $19,000 (how much it cost to make ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"") equals approximately 368.42105263157894736842105263158. So really, ""House of the Dead"" was about 368.42105263157894736842105263158 times more expensive than ""Manos"" to make.

We were not alone as the rest of the cinema-going public gradually and steadily began to join in our appreciation of what we had just seen. Many of them may have been doing so with a sense of irony or relief. Simply pleased to have made it through such a lacklustre piece of Hollywood bilge. But not us. Oh no! this is a film that we have talked about - not only in the long car journey back to our humble small town - but on numerous occasions at our local, college and with others who have yet to see this delightful feast of zombism.

It is to my shame that I can only claim to have seen this film once as firstly I did not wish to view it again at the multiplex for fear it would not make me laugh with such a relish as in my first sitting and secondly due to a lack of a DVD release date. Get it sorted executive types!! this is cult classic in the making.

You may have seen this film and hated it. My advice to you is forget everything you know about what makes a good movie and sit back, relax and enjoy a slice of Gratuitous over acting, pointless nudity and unapologetic ripoffs of all your favourite action films. The Wachowski brother had better get their lawyers ready for this one as it mimics the matrix's moves with unbelievable incompetence

I really hated the first half of it, when the group of B actors first get on the island and realize that something killed all the other people there. But it really started to turn around for me at the beginning of the zombie killing spree. The whole flashback to the actual video game bothered me at first, but then when they included them into the huge killing sequence it only added to the effect for me. Even some of the characters started to get on my good side, like the stupid male model Simon, Liberty the American flag wearing ninja warrior and the sluttily dressed brunette. Yes a lot of parts in this movie were very cheesy and poorly thought out but, all in all I'd have to say that this is quite a fun piece work.

It offers a cross between Dawn of The Dead and Island of Dr. Moreau. The special effects were grand to watch and the story kept the film going.

It's not a philosophy class; who would expect that from a video-game adaption? And it's also not ""Return of the Living Dead"" either.

But it is a fast-paced, hyper-actively-cut movie with neat effects, just 90 mins. of mind shutdown. The director mixes in the fast scenes also pictures from the video game; I like that, although this seems to be my Minority Report on that effect. When you rent this movie, what you expect is a shallow Zombie-action movie with Splatter elements; and voilà! What you get is a shallow Zombie-action movie with Splatter elements.

See it; enjoy it; perhaps see it again; but don't expect Whiskey from a Water bottle. As a video-game adaption this movie is IMHO not bad; and that's all this movie wants to be, so I won't discuss why it fails so extremely in being a stage version of Tolstoi's ""War and Peace""."

Only redeeming factor is a campy turn by Clint Howard, and a few pair of really nice breasts. House of the Dead is not worth a rental, even it's a choice between this and The English Patient. Go fishing. Play some cards. Learn to cook! But don't watch this movie."

553,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"First point. This movie is rubbish. Complete rubbish.

Second point. It knows it's rubbish and does not try to be anything more than rubbish.

It's dire, but it's fun. A world where the fishermen are creepy and speak of evil prophecy? A world where a rave costs a $1000 boat ticket? A world where the dumb yet cute teenagers run around in tight/no tops? Welcome to House Of The Dead. A world that can exist without such things as plot or script, and just focus on killing zombies. And to be honest, good for them! This isn't high brow art, this is dumb enjoyment, and a fun way to kill an hour and a half. You don't need a massive IQ, you just sit down, relax and watch the inevitable dismemberment as a bunch of dumb teens get what's coming to them. OK, so it has plot holes the size of planets, and characters who act with the most frustrating stupidity. So what? The game was a dumb shoot-em-up, why should this be any different? Splicing in clips from the game adds to the computer game feel. So does having death clips where the screen turns red following flashbacks of the characters action. So why discard this policy after the first couple of kills? This is my one major complaint about the film. But apart from this, if you are looking to disengage brain and enjoy a perfectly serviceable horror film then here you go. And in an age where horror films appear to have lost their sense of fun (I'm talking to you Jeepers Creepers and Ginger Snaps) or are verging on the point of ridiculous (Cherry Falls), this film is beyond vital. Other directors, stop acting like we care about the characters!

Final point, I watched this and Oceans Twelve today. One was a perfectly enjoyable film. The other disappeared up it's own arse with it's pretension. No surprises which is which.

Having fun won't make you blind. Enjoy this film."
554,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"The House of the Dead video game is about shooting zombies, the plot is paper thin and the action is intense. It's all about the zombies.

The House of the Dead movie is about shooting zombies and the plot is appropriately thin. The acting is abysmal, they could be cardboard cutouts reading cue cards. The stereotypes are all in order... the Asian is an expert in martial arts, the blondes are dumb, the brunettes are smarter and the girl with the biggest boobs lives longest. Main characters die so fast you wonder if there will be anyone left after 30 minutes. Camera angles twist and turn abruptly just like the video game. The action scenes are spliced together with scenes from the video game. Forget comparisons to other movies, this is The House of the Dead video game come to life.

Despite the shortcomings I enjoyed the fast pace, the twisty camera angles and most of all, the relentless hoards of zombies that serve as cannon fodder for the teenagers turned zombie assassins. If you liked the video game, you'll like the movie, if you like fast action, guns, zombies and hot chicks, you'll love it."
555,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"The movie goes as follows:

A group of teens are looking for the rave of the year, however the guys are late for the boat by 15 minutes. One of the guys goes searching for a boat and a captain to take them there. They arrive but the captain and his mate know that there are evil spirits lurking on the Island. The movie has EXCELLENT special effects that, I personally think, just raise the bar for movies just to high. I really love the idea of using the video game screens to change between scenes, and I really love the idea of instead of using the stupid ""air wave"" idea for slo-mo bullets, the director (Uwe Boll) uses water and it makes for a great and fun movie for everyone to enjoy. Many people say that there is no plot, but you have to play the videogame first! Rudy, who is the last to survive invents the zombies in the first video game and that is what its about, the beginning of the zombies which are supposed to be stopped on December, 18, 1998 (In the video game). This movie is just ahead of its time and that is why people don't like but if the director reads this, I really hope that you direct the sequel which I heard is in development, I hope that you make it EXTREMELY scary!)

If you know the plot of the house of the dead video game you will LOVE the movie!"
556,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"I saw this Movie on the Fantasy Filmfest in Berlin. I just did not expect anything because most Films made after Video Games are just scrap! But this one is just fun! It is well done, good camera (okay, I think the makers saw the Matrix;-), nice Women, not a too bad Story and the most groovy and extended shootout against Zombies I have ever seen. Add a good score an good Songs and you have a very well made new age Zombie thriller that entertains you 90 minutes from the first minute on!!! WATCH IT"
557,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"House of the Dead is based on the Sega game of the same name. I have never played the game myself but this movie doesn't do very much in the way of persuading one to give it a chance. The story is as follows. A group sets out to go to a Rave party on an isolated island and in their first but not last act of stupidity during the course of the film they miss the boat that was to take them. They coax a cigar smuggling boat owner to give them a ride to the island by giving him $1000. 500 to get there and 500 to get back. With all that cash floating around, the group should have skipped the Rave and went and brought some brains. Well, they get to the island and to sum the rest of the film up, there is a lot of running around, screaming, breasts jiggling, tired and I do mean tired stereotypes of every character, especially the Asian character. That was just ridiculous. Uwe Boll must think that the Matrix is the greatest movie of all time because he uses the camera tricks from that film all throughout the battle sequences, which mind you dragged on way too long. And if all of that wasn't bad enough, Uwe Boll has spliced actual game-play action into the movie. He seemed to think it added to the film, even if the scenes from the game didn't always match up with the live action. I don't even have to mention awful dialog and acting because I can forgive those nuances. They can almost be so bad they're entertaining, but some things I just can't forgive. How Uwe Boll ever got anyone to support him in this film is beyond my comprehension.

3/10 Don't waste your time. I'd recommend it to hardcore B movie fans like myself. But if you don't appreciate making fun of movies then don't submit yourself to this torture."
558,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"To fully understand this movie, you have to look at the source content: House of the Dead (the videogame) is a terribly wonderful game (or wonderfully terrible) full of terrible voice acting, nonstop zombie guts, and a paper-thin plot. Translate that to a movie? What do you people expect?

The movie is exactly what it was meant to be, and as far as videogame to movie translations, this one is probably the closest to its source content than any other. They even splice images of zombies getting their heads blown off directly from the game, so that they can show it onscreen without getting an X rating.

Don't expect academy-award winning performances or anything like that. Expect what you get from the game. I can't even express how happy I was at the very end when the movie makes its SOLID connection with the game series. Fans of the game who payed attention to the ""plot"" will love this."

this film is whole over public audience participation. it is not meant, in order to be fearful, but it is dark. I formed it likes a music video for some techno tunes, where the action scenes go faster and faster, in the Synchronized with techno music.

my dream is different cultures and people to get together - in the cinemas or at the houses - people dance to the wonderful music, socialize and have fun with a film about the purest joy to have there are - the joy in shooting Zombies. it will create peace.

560,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"First off, this movie is nowhere near Romero's classic, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, but it doesn't intend to be, it does exactly what it intends to do, be FUN! And boy is it ever fun, when a group of misguided teens explore an evil island infested with the LIVING DEAD! Uwe Boll did a good job, I honestly don't see why people trash this guy. It's nowhere near Boll's ALONE IN THE DARK, which is a much better film, but this is zombie fighting fun at it's finest, my friends. I really enjoyed this movie and I say that honestly.

561,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"House of the Dead was by far one of the best movies I have seen this year. I am shocked at all the bad reviews I have read. House of the Dead has the same old boring zombie story, BUT! there is a twist to this movie, it's kinda like the new diet coke with a twist of lemon. It is the same old formula with a new twist. The twist is the fact that the filming techniques were different and enjoyable. The 360 degree shot of the characters and the clips from the video game really gave this movie it's own identity. Plus it had awesome character development for such a short film. The only problem I have with this movie is Ellie Cornell, who played Casper. I mean what happend to her, she was awesome in halloween 4 & 5. Did she forget how to act? But she did look great and I still love her, so in the end I gave House of the Dead 10 out of 10. It was original with excellent charcater development, it moved quickly and had an awesome score!!! Way to g"
562,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Come on! what is wrong with you people? what is bad about this film? OK i admit that it is a bit boring during the first 35 mins and it doesn't really follow the house of the dead story but after the first 35 mins that film becomes a gory zombie film. it is awesome! the action was very good. this is a good film i don't understand what is so bad about it. so the story is about a group of people who go to some island for a party which they pay ""a grand"" (even though this is an American based film and i don't believe Americans say ""ill pay a grand""(if I'm wrong i apologize)). when they get to the island everyone has disappeared and a bunch of zombies appear out of nowhere and start to kill them. about 50 mins into the film there is a HUUUUUGE action scene which is a montage of zombies getting killed. the gore was awesome and the song was awesome (and that is coming from a guy who normally listens to screamo!) OK i do admit the acting is sometimes a bit plastic and silly and there is some unnecessary nudity in there but this is a decent film that is worth a rent just for the action scene. this is a 15 in the UK and an R in the us because there is gore, swearing and nudity so it isn't recommended for kids but if you want a good zombie film then check this out."
563,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"This movie rocks! Not 'cause it's a game adaptation! Not because of it's story! But because of it's crazy-gunshootin'style. And let's set it clear ""THIS MOVIE IS FAR FROM BEING WORST MOVIE EVER"". I also love very much The House of the Dead series but it's not a reason for me crap on movie. Personally I loved this adaptation, all those 360 degrees shootin' and THE RAVE-TECHNO music during the gunfights+ I love low-budget movies which all this makes a great movie for me, but I'm not a hardcore fan, no. This movie has a bad story+ babes(those moments that DON'T actually like!) +awesome gunshootin' effect equals: COOL MOVIE ABOUT ""LET'S GO TO THE ISLAND TO CRACK SOME ZOMBIES"" AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE GAME. My friend, my summer house neighbour that lives next to me would put 10 of 10, he adores the move! As for me, I think it deserves 9 of 10.

Oh yeah, and the story: Few teens are late for boat that goes to the island on which is Techno-Party going on. So they pay a navy captain Victor Kirk that takes theme there, as they have arrived, no one's home, where have everybody gone? Wanna know more? Watch the House of the Dead !!!"
564,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Okay this movie is SUPPOSED to be campy. It isn't supposed to scare you really. It is just a zombie flick based of the arcade game. It isn't supposed to be brilliant just entertaining. The acting is fine. The story is simple. The effects are gory and cool. Lots of explosions and blood spurts. Great music and action sequences. Anyone who disses this movie doesn't understand the zombie genre. If looking for a serious scary film or serious zombie film watch Resident Evil. Not this. But in and of itself and what it is supposed to be it is great. The plot holes aren't serious unless you are looking instead of watching the movie in which case i suggest you lessen up. They are just rich kids with no brains. Of course they stay after seeing a blood covered camp they are stupid. And if you were watching it you would see that the person who controls the boat didn't want to go so they couldn't either and then it was too late. Anyways not a masterpiece but better entertainment than any of the crappy remakes coming out lately.

566,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"You know, the very first movie that was ever based on a video game already suckedThe fact that untalented directors repeat this formula is just plain stupid. But what really is retarded is that there are still idiots like myself who actually keep watching this stuff! House of the Dead is based on a Sega video game and that shows rather clearly from the very first minute. This lame excuse for a horror movie is annoyance from start to finish with ridiculous characters, boisterous nu-metal music and awfully cinematographed gore. Empty-headed, ravishing looking teenagers (read: bimbo-chicks wearing hot thongs and an overload of cleavage and hormone-driven boys) set sail to a deserted island to go wild at a rave. But, oh nothe island is congested with zombies. Bang, there's your plot. It doesn't bother me that we're presented the same plot again for the millionth time, actually. The awfulness of House of the Dead goes far beyond bad script problems. Footage from the stupid video game is edited into the film, with an incredibly negative effect as a result! Director Uwe Boll (what's in a name) didn't made no horror film! He just shot a long promotional campaign to praise a meaningless, violent video game! Not one aspect about House of the Dead deserves a little sympathy. There's absolutely no tension or horrific atmosphere (or what else did you expect), the references towards real horror movies (like George A. Romero's powerful trilogy of the Dead) only sound embarrassing from the mouths of the players here and the acting is very atrocious. I should have knownevery film in which Clint Howard stars soon turns out to be a stinker. That must be this guy's birthright or something. Jürgen Prochnow reached an absolute low in his career with this, too. No matter how you look at it: House of the Dead is an absolute stinker! I respect everyone's opinion on movies but if you, by any chance, would think highly of this piece of crap, you're just plain wrong."
567,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"The only review of this one I really read was one on Ain't it Cool news (a site I'm trying to break the habit of visiting) where the guy simply repeated the words ""sucked"" over and over again.

While I kept that in mind as i rented this one, you should keep something else in mind before you read this.

1. I love zombie movies. Yes, I'm one of those guys. Zombie films like Dawn of the Dead and Lucio Fulci's Zombie were part of my initial education of the horror genra back in 1997. It's a genra that apart from a few hiccups, had been dormant since the mid-80's.

2. And this is the kicker: I actually kind of like movies based off of video games. Well, I should change that too: I'll give movies based off of video games a chance. Maybe it's because I grew up in the age of the original Nintendo (and the age of the Atari, now that I think about it, although I was so young then that I had to ask my dad to hook it up everytime I wanted to play it), but I think it's possible to make a video game based movie as long as the film captures the spirit of the game. It's been done before: Both Tomb Raider films are kind of nifty; Mortal Kombat was fun in a Saturday afternoon way; And Resident Evil was OK, I suppose. But it's also been done really poorly: Wing Commander (does anyone even remember that game?); Double Dragon; Street Fighter all come to mind.

So, here we are with House of the Dead, an adaptation of the Sega arcade game (I'm guessing it was available on other platforms, but I'm only familer with the ardade version).

It was one of those first person games where the player used a lightgun to fire at zombies and such that lurched towards them. It was pretty cool, I suppose. And did a fairly good job of recreating the vibe of a 70's zombie flick. So, I actually thought it made a lot of sense to make a movie based off of it.

The Plot: A handful of young adults get a ferry ride to an island where an allnight rave is being held. They arrive only to find the place deserted, except for the legions of zombies being raised by the spirit of a tortured Spanish scientist from the 14th century or something.

Thrown into the mix are a crusty sea smuggler, and an undercover police officer.

The first twenty minutes or so of this is more bland than it is bad. But when the zombies start popping up, House of the Dead reaches an apex of sorts in what its trying to do. Let's just say that when the protagonists launch their big offensive against the dead, the story gives way to what seems like nearly 25 minutes of uninterrupted bloody action.

Bullets fly, heads go exploding, limbs get munched. All to the tune of a heavy metal song that I actually kind of liked. Well, I didn't like it so much as I thought it fit the scene real well. Maybe it's that part of me that grew up in the era of Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, but it's kind of nice to have heavy metal reclassified as ""devil music"" instead of ""I'm mad at my mommy for bringing home a stepdaddy music.""

Yes, it's silly. Yes, the constant screen shots from the video game are a bit much. Yes, like i said, the big battle really does occupy nearly a third of the film's running time. All of these criticisms are valid, I suppose.

Still, the movie worked for me. 2003 and 2004 found horror coming back to life in a way. New directors were going back to the past for inspiration, and bringing back new takes on old stories. Eli Roth's ""Cabin Fever"" drew from cyncical portraits of human cruelty like ""Last House on the Left."" Marcus Nispel's redux of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" did the same, only with a nearly apocalyptic visual sense. Heck, even the 2004 take of ""Dawn of the Dead"" showed new audiences a hint of the cerebral horror of George Romero.

It's amazing how quickly we lose our perspective on the genra. ""House of the Dead"", as far as im concerned, is the best, heck, the only, attempt at bringing the gritty, sloppy, rotten, zombie experience of Fulci back to life. Something I thought I'd never see playing at my local cineplex.

Don't believe me? Well maybe I should give you some perspective. I told myself a long time ago that I wasn't going to complain anymore about ""Scream"" and wave of films passing themselves off as horror through the late 90's, since that genra has pretty much died out now, and that by doing so I was really starting to sound like one of those Fangoria dweebs. But honestly, what would you rather sit through when you go to the movies? ""Valentine"" or ""House of the Dead?"" ""Urban Legends"" or ""House of the Dead?"" ""I know what you did last summer"" or ""House of the Dead?""

Yea, I thought so."
568,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"I must say one thing about this movie is for sure, it was probably the worst movie of my life. I own about 500 DVDs, and sure, half of them are horror films, but I refused to buy to this DVD. My wife and I love the video game, so for sure we were going to see it whenever it came out in the movie theater. We drove thirty miles to see it and paid $10 a person to get in. After about ten minutes, my wife wanted to go. I mean, how are you going to tell us who lives in the beginning sequence of events? How is going to pay $1500 for a boat ride? Why are there no houses on the island and just some old church? Hmmm, I think they should have redone the title there. Where was Neo during on those Matrix shots? I must have missed him, oh well. Hopefully in the sequel huh? I just can't believe how terrible this movie was. Terrible terrible terrible. I wouldn't even recommend the use of showing this movie on cable tv. A waste of oxygen, a waste of time, a waste of film.

At time it just seems like really bad music video. The flashes of scenes from the video game really don't help. Especially as this is meant to be a prequel of the games?

I gave this a rating of 2/10. The only reason it has a 2 not a 1 is for Jurgen Prochnow. He has some great comedic moments. Well great for this film!

570,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Where to begin? This film is a disaster. I've never seen so many bad things come in such rapid succession. It's like the cinematic equivalent of a 200 car freeway pileup. The characters are shallow, one-dimensional, corny, annoying, and generally unlikeable. I didn't care about a single one of them. The actors portraying these ridiculous characters seem to have been given no direction whatsoever, they just stumble their way through the movie trying to make the best of the horror script. The story is dumb, hardly explained, and makes little to no sense. The cinematography is actually not bad at times and the production values are adequate, it's just a shame these aspects didn't go into a better project. Uwe Boll fancies himself as some sort of brilliant auteur who the critics just happen to pick on for personal reasons. It's nothing personal, Mr. Boll. It's your work.

571,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Uwe Boll has come to be known as the worst director in Hollywood. The new Ed Wood, the all time supreme master of crap. This film has mediocre action sequences that make no sense and copy other films, it has nothing to do with the famous arcade game, and agent G is apparently a black guy. Uwe Boll you are terrible and you really had a cornucopia of things hand wrapped and given out to you, but you had to do it your way didn't you? But I still cannot get over how terrifically mental it is to not have G and Rogan be main characters. Instead you had to take a bunch of idiot teenagers that we aren't attached because they are so unlikable, and then you screw up the race of which G is. YOU COULDN'T EVEN GET THAT TINY LITTLE PART RIGHT! This was a golden opportunity to expand the HOTD universe and add on to the classic game. It was a chance to make thousands of HOTD fans become proud that there favorite game series was picking up and expanding more. But this is just a smear of trash, making sega curse the day they made the game and making people curse the day they ever picked up one of the classic arcade guns. This film blows. Bad dialogue, scenes, acting, editing, and most of all directing."
572,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"This is the worst zombie movie I've ever seen and one of the worst movies of all time. Directed by the infamous Uwe Boll, this train wreck of a movie is full of unintentional laughs, plot holes, silly dialogues and awful acting. Every aspect of the movie is completely disastrous and it's safe to say that House of the Dead has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The constant referencing to other, better movies (Jaws, Rain Man, LOTR, The Elephant Man, Matrix) doesn't help either. Also, I don't understand how Jürgen Prochnow, the star of the great classic movie Das Boot, landed a role in this pile of nonsense. The name of his character is Kirk, and he is a captain. I'm not kidding you.

Anyway, House of the Dead is based on an arcade game of the same name. I'm not familiar with the game but I'm going to guess that the movie's plot is in no way connected to the game's storyline – something so inane as this movie's synopsis could only exist in an Uwe Boll movie. Since it's based on a game, Uwe Boll, for some reason, decided to put video clips from the original game into the movie, 32 of them. As a result, the movie's action is often interrupted by the video game clips. I don't know why would anyone in their right mind do such a thing, but that only proves that Uwe Boll has the directing abilities of a mentally challenged monkey. Back to the plot: a group of friends want to get to a rave party on an island named the Island of Death. They are somehow late for the boat that is supposed to take them there, so they pay a big amount of money to a suspicious captain who does. When they arrive, they notice no one is there and the spot were the party was meant to take place is covered in blood. Nonetheless, they decide to get drunk and have sex.

It's noteworthy to mention that the protagonist and the narrator of the story (whose opening narration kind of spoils the movie) doesn't show up until a half an hour into the movie. Not only is the protagonist a problem – the antagonist is atrocious as well. The villain is an immortal Spanish priest named Castillo who, by using some mutated blood (this is never fully resolved), resurrects the dead. His actions, goals and motivations are never thoroughly explained. Of course, there is the scene where a character asks him why did he become immortal. To live forever!, Castillo replies. This exchange of unintentionally hilarious dialogue is as far as Castillo's development goes.

In the third act of the movie, there is an action sequence which runs for about 10 minutes or so (in case you're interested, the duration of the whole movie is 90 minutes). This sequence could have been OK, if it weren't for the aforementioned video game clips interrupting it and for the disgraceful editing. Eventually, House of the Dead ends just like it started – as a messy train wreck of a movie that should be ignored for the rest of eternity.

573,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Let me put this into perspective.

The Battle of Los Angelas (The mockbuster) was awful but had some fun lines and sfx to appease a bit.

Battlefield earth was awful but it had John travolta

And street fighter 94 was actually fun, heck even super mario had a budget to give some value.

This film rivals of the Legend of chun Li, it has such a bad plot but its almost as if the writers from stepbrothers (will farrel movie) tried doing suspense. It matches and (god forbid) actually betters Mortal kombat Armageddon in terms of so bad its not funny.

Put it simply this is the movie that made Uwe Boll despised amongst the gaming community and its not worth seeing the movie for that reason. I have watched this on DVD by the cheap from the public library. It will be returned first thing tomorrow.

Simply put the film as every review has stated involves some 20 somethings who miss a boat to a rave at a hard to get Island and decide to fork out $1000 for the trip to AND back. However this isn't the absurd part, the absurd part occurs before that scene where literally 3 minutes into the film we have a character who narrates saying who has survived the ordeal (that we are yet to see)

Its the same narrator who repeats the obvious such as when the group miss the boat, he mentions it again to the viewer (in a more dramatic fashion but in a clichéd sense)

If the fast forward button was not invented I would had packed the DVD away at this point, storytelling is dead and we spend 15minutes watching this group pay for the absurd trip, and walk round topless. (Even that isn't much of a selling point)

In lazy fashion the film 'reveals' the terrifying secrets of the Island...via a video camera showing the 'rave' disturbed by the undead. I can pick at how well handled the camera is during the filming of supposed massacre but even this old technique that has never been perfected since the Blair witch project adds dread or feels in any way original, and nor does it explain how the zombies can be so clean in their kills. They kill, eat and spill blood on the rave and when the group arrive all they find is one bloody T-short, even then they think its just a prank.

Regarding zombies, their full of contradictions. We see them swim, sneak around in the bushes in very fast and swift movement, run and are quite agile acting not quite like zombies. Even for the zombie fan there is no gore, one or two zombies even have no make-up on! It's even more astounding that 'sega' uses old house of the dead shoot em up clips from the game on the basis it acts as a homage or adds something to the movie.

The music is awful, sounding out of place and the budget is basically rubber suited maskmen. I dislike Anderson's take on resident evil but it is at least entertain and has some good moments.

The acting is terrible with the most boring story they could offer, characters pop out of nowhere without sense, cgi is just a clip from the first house of the dead game (and that is not a compliment) the direction for these characters is non paced and non existent. Even the eye candy dries up very quickly in this film.

This is the 'plan 9 from outer space' for video game movies. it really is that bad. How Uwe boll or his friends have jobs in the film industry (or got their qualifications) I do not know but this is truly dire.

ONLY watch if you have a fast forward button but even as you fast forward you'll find nothing worth watching."
574,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Quite possibly the funniest film I have seen. I was convulsed with laughter through the whole thing. The production instincts are reliably 180 degrees misaligned; it's not so much inept as inspired, in the sense that nobody could deliberately fashion a movie so awkward and off-key. I just can't believe that--this must be the doing of an idiot- savant. I don't find fault with the actors (who deliver inane lines with brio) or have much to criticize on technical grounds. There's always enough going on to keep you watching while they're setting up the next howler of a scene, and any such expectation is never disappointed.

This is an uncompromising, take-it-or-leave-it work of a singular artistic vision and bizarro genius. Judging it as a video game adaptation, or horror flick or whatever, is beside the point. In the right frame of mind you can't go wrong with this hilarious movie. But it's the little things that really make the difference, e.g. when suddenly the name of the raver-girl character, whose costume is patterned after an American flag, is revealed for the first time to be ""Liberty,"" after she's attacked by a monster late in the story (Guy: ""No!!! Liberty!!!! NOOOOOO!!!!""). Minus one star cuz it needed more scenes with Uwe Boll in the Gorton's fisherman's outfit."

That was the worst part of the film! The story was OK. The linear story direction was put well. Now the visuals had its great points and annoying points.

578,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"I first just wanna say the standards people had for this movie amaze me considering the source material. The House of the Dead games are widely considered having of the worst acting found in any video game series period. The House of the Dead games were rail-gun shooters, where you would shoot lot's of zombies with bits of plot about. They were amazing, but their story bits were also shamelessly (intentionally?) poorly done.

This film is actually pretty entetaining as a weirdo horror film goes. The acting is bad, but that's okay because it's campy, and the action is over-the-top but well-shot. The story is cheesy, but that's on par with the source material.

Just look at this way. If they made a truly good film based off the House of the Dead games, it would be a bad adaptation. Go on Youtube.com and look up video-footage of House of the Dead 2. I swear that the actors are foreigners reading transliterati"
579,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"This movie is so incredibly horrifically bad, that it has gone past bad and back to good. This movie is so bad that it is one of the funniest movies ever made. The dialouge is so bad, that every line is humorous, the special effects are so bad they make you giggle, and the video game scene transitions, they are funny every time, surprisingly enough, they never get old. The actors are so bad they make this movie even more enjoyable, including Ron Howard's retarded brother. There is absolutely no continuity in this movie what-so-ever, which is also humorous. There is one fight scene, in which they have to fight their way into a mysterious and/or creepy looking castle thing, and even though it is only a short walk it takes them about ten minutes to fight their way there, they kill countless zombies, and yet when there is a wide shot, there are relatively no bodies on the ground. Another humorous thing is to watch some of the special features, it is funny because everyone in the movie is actually taking it seriously, I was shocked. Not to mention that the blonde actress isn't really an actress at all, because she is exactly the same as her retarded on screen counter-part. Uwe Bol will certainly do down in history as the worst director of all time, which is good news for Ed Wood, incidentally. The cinematography is so cheesy and stupid, it looks like something a seven year old concocted, and the music, dear sweet Jesus god, don't even get me started on how great the music was. It was so bad, that it added to the humor of the movie. I love this movie. It is one of the funniest movies ever made, and I would highly recommend it, if you watch it, you will not be disappointed.

580,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"House of the Dead is the first of German auteur Uwe Boll's computer game adaptations. The film made money for its investors, pleased Gamers and triggered an inexplicable landslide of contempt from just about everyone else. The level of criticism directed at this film is utterly ridiculous. House of the Dead is not only a good zombie movie but also the most faithful adaptation of a computer game committed to film.

The film's storyline is paper thin. A group of annoying college students sail to a remote island for a ""rave"" dance party. Unfortunately, the island is inhabited by zombies and lots of people get munched. That's it. Personally, I have no problem with this bare bones approach to storytelling. Unlike Romero's zombie trilogy, there is no social commentary and the film is definitely not a parable for current societal woes. Uwe Boll has no hidden agenda; Boll's only aim is to entertain and he succeeds with a roller-coaster ride of non-stop action, gratuitous breast nudity and corny one-liners. There is nothing high brow about this film and for that I am thankful.

The most surprising aspect of ""House of the Dead"" is how close it stays to its source material: Computer graphics blend into the action scenes, several characters spin to signify death - a trademark of the game, at one stage animated blood drips down the screen, the selection of weapons is almost identical and the techno soundtrack could have been lifted directly from the game. The end result is a film that plays more like a computer game. The pacing is relentless and the live action violence is stylised to the point where it resembles animation. I found the film's mixed media approach highly innovative and distinctive. Obviously, I am in the minority.

In addition to its highly unusual visual style, the film's other memorable attribute is the zombie action. I'm not sure how zombie fans could fail to be impressed by the non-stop zombie violence. The make-up and special effects are excellent and the set piece outside the ""house of the dead"" is fantastic. Boll intersperses slow motion with editing that would make John Woo nauseous in order to create a highly original spectacle. The scene where the zombies chase Simon underwater is fun and a nice little nod to Fulci's brilliant ""Zombi 2"". Uwe Boll's direction can be described with a lot of different adjectives but ""boring"" is not one of them. The film has an interesting cast, who admittedly have very little to do apart from run and scream. However, it is always nice to see Juergen Prochnow and Will Sanderson makes another notable appearance in an Uwe Boll production.

House of the Dead is one of the better zombie films of the past two decades. I couldn't care less if the film plays like a computer game on steroids. At least House of the Dead has the decency not to bother with the pretence that is has something to say. Some may call it low brow trash - I call it entertainment."
581,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"...but sadly little else, thanks to the empty script. Uwe Boll's oft-bashed first US feature is not the train wreck many bandwagon-haters proclaim it to be, though it is certainly no master piece.

The movie starts out with a flash back monologue that lets the audience know bad things are afoot (like we couldn't already guess that) and then is off and running with some party scenes on a gorgeous island that concludes with a some skinny dipping carnage (is there any other kind). From there the film introduces most of the primary cast as they attempt to reach the ""party of the year"" on the island, only to find instead a zombie wasteland.

OK, the story pretty much sucks. Forget about the script taking chances, it barely can keep itself afloat with clique characters and some awful dialogue. Fortunately, genre regulars Jurgen (Seventh Sign) Prochnew, Ellie (Halloween 4) Cornell, Jonathan (Final Destination 2) Cherry, and the ever lovable Clint (oh just pick one) Howard are on hand to add the right amount of knowing winks to make things alright.

From the production stand point, things are fairly polished given the uber-low budget. Boll is actually able to scratch out some occasionally nifty visual effects to go along with the gobs of creature gore on hand. The zombies themselves are plentiful and damn near every one gets the ever loving hell blow out of them, much to my delight (why else do people watch these things).

It does nothing to advance the zombie sub-genre, nor does it effect a quality story, but the over abundance of zombie carnage ought to keep most horror fans happy.

583,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"I have a pretty good tolerance for ill conceived and cheesy horror and Sci-Fi movies (I once watched SciFi Channel movies ""DinoCroc"" and ""Boa Vs. Python"" back to back on my VCR and had a decent time). But ""House of the Dead"" made me hit my gag limit early on. How early? Try five minutes into the film.

So every day or so, I'd go back and try to watch some more of it from my Tivo, and every time I'd quit in disgust within 3-5 minutes. I kept expecting it to get better somehow, or at least watchable, but it started out as pure crap and never wavered in its unwinking commitment to a level of suck rarely seen in professionally made movies. Eventually I managed to finish it (talk about misguided consumer masochism). And I just have to say...

Uwe Boll is a phenomenally bad director. Just awful. It's obvious that he didn't really give the cast any real direction at all. He just left them out there on their own without a clue, and the results are like watching a first time 'reader's theater' walk-through of the working script. Not one single line of dialog worked. Not one scene was watchable. Not one story element made sense. Not once did the camera work and cinematography do anything but clumsily (and unsuccessfully) ape the ideas and techniques of other, far better movies. Not once did the plot engage my interest. Not once did I feel fear, shock, suspense, anxiety or interest in any of the characters. Timing, rhythm, story arc, character development, believable character reactions, consistent story structure or even decent SFX...""House Of The Dead"" cares not for such things.

And just to throw a final spadeful of dirt onto the grave, some genius decided to edit actual game footage from the original ""House Of the Dead"" game in the middle of some the action footage, a disastrous aesthetic choice that jams the incompetence of the proceedings into the audiences' faces like a hot-tar dermabrasion.

The only reason this movie gets more than a ""1"" is because Jurgen Prochnow is in it and ""Das Boot"" was so great that I can't bear to give a ""1"" (or a ""0"") to something he was involved with.

Not only can I not understand why Boll is allowed to go on making movies...I can't understand why audiences who paid money to see this abomination didn't riot and burn down the theaters. The producers must have arranged to sneak roofies into the oil on the buttered popcorn."

585,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"I read the IMDb scores and reviews before watching House of the Dead and thought I'd watch to see just how bad it was. I was pleasantly surprised to spend an hour and a half watching a decent film; much better than a lot of big budget stuff, such as some of the Hollywood remakes of some horror classics. So long as you understand the budget background, and find lower budget films entertaining - such as great Brit Flicks like Shawn of the Dead -there's something worth watching here. I'm guessing this was more of a Canadian film than USA, and that seems to show in the whole manner of the film. I've often found that many Canadian movies to have some magic ingredient that makes them stand out, but an ingredient that doesn't taste good to the masses.

The effects were appropriate for the low budget background; don't expect the sort of stuff you see in Resident Evil. Apart from too much dialogue to the audience at the beginning, the direction and production quality was good. The acting was appropriate for the roles without being award quality; bimbos were bimbos, tough guys were tough guys, etc. The lead role (J Cherry) was the usual brooding thoughtful hero type.

Simple, unchallenging entertainment that doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. If you are a fan of the original game or game genre you should like it."

587,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Dear director Uwe Boll:

Please stop making what you call movies out of old video games. This... this 'thing' you called a movie isn't really a movie, it's like a music video. A very long music video with a thin plot and laughable characters. So I have an idea for you. Instead of calling yourself a director, and saying you make movies, you can call yourself a 'thing-maker', and just say you make things. Because I will be perfectly honest with you, they sure aren't movies.

Several times while watching this 'thing', I asked myself if you were really there with the actors, directing it, or if you walked away and took a coffee break, took a day off, or, perhaps, went on vacation. You certainly have money to take a break, because the production companies are handing you money to make these 'things'.

See, you accept scripts that have NOTHING to do with the storyline of the video game itself. It's a difficult task, I know. But when you make things like this that has a fan base, you have to take a care that you don't alienate that fan base. If there isn't enough of a budget, then I suggest you don't make the 'thing', or perhaps do something else constructive with the small budget that you have. Because actors that have no idea how to act, redundant special effects, and general chaos of a crapped on script just doesn't bring in the audience, Uwe. Also, splicing in scenes of the Sega video game that your 'thing' is based on was a bad idea. The real problem comes when we see these video game clips over and over again, like as if they made your thing better.

I'll give your thing a 2, Uwe. There were some OK splatter-gore scenes, and yes, you did tell several of your actresses to take off their clothes. And that's all I could say about your 'thing', because there are other filmmakers that make low budget horror films that are much better at doing sex and violence.

Now, please stop making your 'things'."

590,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Movie Snob reporting back with tonight's ""film"", House of the Dead.

Reviewing this ""film"" is a difficult endeavor. House of the Dead is not a film in the traditional sense. Sure it's a combination of a dozen other Zombie movies combined with a MTV style by way of the Matrix, but that isn't why HoD can be considered something other than a normal spook flic. HoD was shot in a way that deliberately de-emphasized the narrative nature of film. HoD, like Tomb Raider before it, was based upon a video game, but unlike other movies based upon video games, this thing never wanted to stray from what inspired it. Actual shots from the video game are interspersed into the multiple action sequences that make up HoD.

Now, this obviously destroys any semblance of suspending disbelief. Shots of Playstation zombies getting their comeuppance during the middle of a cinematic zombie battle make sure that you are brought back to reality. There is no horror here; Hod screams at you, ""hey dummy, this is just a video game. Settle back and enjoy the carnage!"" ...and the carnage is quite good. I'm not sure that I was aware that there was this many ways to splatter a member of the living dead.

I could discuss the cast, the ""plot"", or even the lame script, but what's the point really? House of the Dead is just a 90 minute back story to a reasonably popular video game. If you think you'd like that sort of thing, you'll like this. If not, rent a copy of anything by George Romero and see what a master of the genre can do.

Movie Snob gives House of the Dead a 5."
591,House of the Dead (2003),2.0,Uwe Boll,"Okay, The best way to enjoy HotD is to get in touch with your inner ten year old child. If you can't enjoy Cheesy B flicks like that, then don't go.

If you're the kind who quotes the ""Romero Bible"", don't go. Zombies aren't limited by rules, only the limits of your imagination.

As corny as you might find that, it may be the best way to enjoy this very flawed movie. HotD is, at best, a Roger Corman/Sci-Fi channel type of film. Bad cheese, but I've seen worse.

Best reason to watch: Jurgen Prochnow and Ellie Cornell. They have the most dignified characters, the most common sense, and the best lines. They also have the best death scenes (If you're into that kind of critiquing) Kira, Will and Ona really try, but the script fails them and the other cast members

The music wasn't so bad, and the action scenes kicked butt. I can tolerate the arcade stuff added in. It's not that annoying if you simply accept this as an Arcade action flick and not a horror film. I wanted to see the gang kick zombie butt, and I got my money's worth.

Worst elements: The script dialogue. Ellie and Jurgen get the best lines. Otherwise, there is not an ounce of wit or clever banter.

Rudy is the worst Hero since Stephen Dorff's cop from ""Fear Dot Com"" and Jared Leto's Paul from ""Urban Legends"". Casper and Kirk SHOULD have been the main characters since they at least TRIED to save everybody, while Rudy just stares at his current girlfriend getting ripped to shreds.

Sloppy editing. Stupid teen antics.

BIGGEST mistake in the whole film is to have Rudy open the movie with the lines ""If they hadn't come, they'd still be alive"". This has killed any suspense of seeing who survives in the end!

I don't think it's a terrible film, despite my comments. It's a Cheesy B flick, nothing more. But I do HOPE that Uwe Boll and Mark Altman LEARN from these flaws. A sequal is in the planning stages, which may be better than the first if they write and shoot a more clever script"

First, Rob Zombies atrocious House of 1000 Corpses and now this. Uwe Boll shows (minimal)potential in the directors chair until the bad acting and over the top matrix rip off effects take over. Note to Hollywood Part 2: Stop using the bullet time effects, it was good the first 200 times we saw it. I can only hope that the Dawn of the Dead remake stays away from cgi and any type of bullet time effects and makes a make up/prop inspired zombie flick.

I thought it was impossible to make a bad zombie flick and I was wrong. HoD had potential but the director and actors give up on this doomed venture before it started.

My grade: 4/10! A few decent scenes saved this one from 1/10!

Note to Hollywood Part 3: Some studio spent $12 million on this, shame on you. You should have financed Romero's 4th Dead flick."

Nobody seemed interested in seeing this movie, only 3 were in the theater; two passed out after 10 minutes, and they were the lucky ones. The 'monsters' were the unemployed worm from Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan, and rejected designs for the space creatures in Alien. The creators of the movie obviously didn't want to overshadow the third rate movie monsters, so they hired forth rate actors who apparently didn't get to memorize their lines, or in some cases learn to pronounce the words before filming began. Some scenes are incredibly inept in conveying just what is supposed to be happening, if anything is. If you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this movie is showing, and you don't pass out, you'll laugh at what are supposed to be frightening or suspenseful moments of the film. The implausibility of several scenes will just stun you, and Stephen Dorff's regular spewing of the 'Queen Mary of curse words' conveys the feeling of anyone who pays to see this. If you must see this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until it's in the bargain bin at the video store. If there's any justice in the film industry, one of the main actors will be there to rent it to you."
602,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"I was honestly surprised by Alone in the Dark. It was so bad, I could hardly believe what I was seeing. There are no characters, just a few stereotypes wandering around and getting killed. The extent of the character development was giving each character a name and an occupation, and that's about it. There was no real plot, and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation. In fact, many action scenes just began on their own, coming from nowhere with a pounding techno track. While I was watching this movie I kept asking ""Where is this happening? What's going on?"" The acting was high school drama quality, with stiff wooden delivery, as though the actors were reading from cue cards without comprehending their lines. Their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by horrible sound design. ADR sounded like it was recorded in an open room. The actors were constantly taking obvious care to hit their marks, looking almost robotic in their movements. So, these listless automatons are whisked through a series of implausible and confusing scenarios, often without even the benefit of transition scenes. They were here, now they're there. This was happening, now that's happening. Random scenes with little rhyme or reason. I had a lot of fun watching it. Definitely not worth nine bucks though."
603,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"This movie succeeds at being one of the most unique movies you've seen. However this comes from the fact that you can't make heads or tails of this mess. It almost seems as a series of challenges set up to determine whether or not you are willing to walk out of the movie and give up the money you just paid. If you don't want to feel slighted you'll sit through this horrible film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved, they've all seen better days, but then you realize they actually got paid quite a bit of money to do this and you'll lose pity for them just like you've already done for the film. I can't go on enough about this horrible movie, its almost something that Ed Wood would have made and in that case it surely would have been his masterpiece.

To start you are forced to sit through an opening dialogue the likes of which you've never seen/heard, this thing has got to be five minutes long. On top of that it is narrated, as to suggest that you the viewer cannot read. Then we meet Mr. Slater and the barrage of terrible lines gets underway, it is as if he is operating solely to get lines on to the movie poster tag line. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff, who I typically enjoy) and he does his best not to drown in this but ultimately he does. Then comes the ultimate insult, Tara Reid playing an intelligent role, oh help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she continually gets roles in movies, in my opinion though she should stick to movies of the American pie type.

All in all you just may want to see this for yourself when it comes out on video, I know that I got a kick out of it, I mean lets all be honest here, sometimes its comforting to revel in the shortcomings of others."
604,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"The movie starts out with some scrolling text which takes nearly five minutes. It gives the basic summary of what is going on. This could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect. Soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about, keep in mind this is ALL you will learn about them. The plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie. Not only does the plot change, but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie. I have never played the video game, but know people who have. From my understanding whether you've played the game or not this movie does not get any better. Save your money unless you like to sleep at the theaters."

The direction, editing, sound (do we really need a heavy-metal video in the middle of a gunfight?), costumes (bulletproof vests with muscles on them), and hey, there's no discernible plot either.

To anyone who can't understand, here it is in block capitals for you: VIDEO GAMES DO NOT MAKE FOR GOOD MOVIES! The acting here is, at best, sub-standard. The set design and special effects are poor. Unlike the video game (which did have its scary moments) the movie has no atmosphere of impending doom, no sense of danger or menace. Pacing and plotting is confused and the paper that the script is printed on would have been better used as toilet paper. The main culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a paintbrush. Hackneyed zooms, swoops and pans are spliced into the whole dreary affair at unpredictable moments leaving the audience disorientated and bored.

This movie was no Manos: The Hands of Fate, or Troll 2 (yes, I have seen them both.. twice) but at the same time this movie is No Alien, Predator or even Alien Vs. Predator (Yes, even that movie surpassed this). Movies like this make Battlefield Earth look like a Star Wars it is so bad. Razzie awards lookout, your biggest competition has just arrived in theaters. This film I'm talking about is of course Alone in the Dark. I'll try to take you though a step by step process on why this film was so bad.

Acting- I'll first start off with what perhaps was the best component of this film (next to the ending credits, which played 'Wish I had An Angel', the acting. Christian Slater must be proud of himself, he successfully proved that it is possible to act decent in a film worse then drinking antifreeze. Though all his awful dialog he had to speak, it made me wonder why he just didn't walk off the set halfway. Perhaps it was because of Stephen Dorff being in the film as well (somebody he wishes he could be but fails at it). Tara Reid is a bad actress but good looking and that's all that really matters in films like these. That is not to say the acting was perfect though, it was average, not good, and perhaps the only thing in the film not good.

The Soundtrack- Except for 'Wish I had An Angel', the soundtrack is pointless and bad heavy medal being pumped into the viewers ears, perhaps to disguise the awful story (something I will get to soon). A long and very expensive 2 CD soundtrack is now up for sale for those musically challenged.

The Directing- Directed by Hollywoods favorite director Uwe Ball who brought us the classic House of the Dead. Telling us ""Yes, movies can get this utterly bad and that's just the beginning to my deadly saga of awful movies"". At least it is said to be directed by Uwe Ball. Without being told I would have guessed a monkey was kidnapped from the Congo, brought here and forced to make opinions on how to make the movie under penalty of being shocked. The director of photography was probably a camcorder taped onto a skateboard and pushed forward until it hits a wall. On the scenes where the camera should stay still it is constantly moving, not allowing us to stop anywhere and when it should be moving in action, the camera stops for some reason.

The Producing- Who on earth is stupid enough to put money towards this bomb? I pity the fool... sometimes. Sometimes I'm glad he or she was taught such a lesson to never put money towards garbage worse then dog dung tied up in a bag.

The Writing / Storyboard- Trying to Analise the story is more painful then jamming an ice pick under a big toe and kicking a soccer ball as hard as I possibly could with it right after but I will still attempt it.

Edward Carnby escapes as a child from an orphanage where 20 children where to go under science experiments. He escapes and hides in an electrical outlet where he is electrocuted (this is the point where it got so bad i started to laugh out loud). Then it fast-forwards many years later where he's a paranoia detective. He get's attacked by some zombie that can't be shot to death, kills it and moves on with life. Later on he gets attacked by some crazy looking monster and he discovers secrets that nobody else knows.

Yeah, the plot is bad, really really bad. The film beings with expecting us to read approximately 10 minutes, which felt like 100, of random text about an untrue civilization called the Abskani. The film goes not to have one twist after another, more then the audience can handle, more then the audience wants to handle, more then the audience could ever care about. This storyline is rock bottom bad that even Double Dragon does better.

Overall, miss out on this movie. I gave it a 1 out of 10 but that is because there is no 0."
610,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"I usually start by relaying the premise of the film, but before anyone makes any hasty judgments about my review, let me preface it by saying that I'm someone who likes most films (just check my other reviews). Alone in the Dark is a film by director Uwe Boll, whose film right before this one was House of the Dead (2003). Like Alone in the Dark, it was also a film adaptation of a video game. Almost everyone hated it. Well, I loved it. I even gave it a 10 out of 10! My point in stating this (which will surely turn some readers off immediately) is that if even I hated Alone in the Dark, there must be something wrong with it.

The Premise: Who am I kidding? Attempting to state a premise for this film is about as easy as trying to balance the United States' budget, but here it goes anyway. Some archaeologists discovered evidence of some lost American Indian tribe. The Indian tribe apparently had discovered some means of broaching the ""second world"", which was evil in nature. The bad stuff wiped them out, but not before they could lock the door to the evil world and throw away the key. Later, some scientist/government researcher who had been experimenting with the paranormal, and specifically this tribe, decided to experiment on some kids, to try to produce some kind of hybrid with the second world. (Believe it or not--everything up to this point and then some is told to us in a written prologue to the film--it's just white text scrolling across a black screen with a voice-over also reading it to us). Then, there was something about the kids being in an orphanage, but the government takes them back out, and then a bunch of people are searching for archaeological relics, and there are super humans roaming around, and a bunch of military people are called in and on and on.

In fact, the exposition never really stops. It's like a neverending backstory from hell. There are enough ideas here to fill at least 10 films, maybe 25. But not one of them is presented in a coherent way to create one good film. In addition to the mystical lost Indian tribe and the superhumans, we also get monsters that resemble a cross between Alien and a werewolf, worms that invade your body and turn into snake-like aliens, tunneling worms underground, zombies, Starship Trooper-like wars, evil scientists, underground lairs, gold mines, spooky warehouses, impalements, big mostly unused museums, government conspiracies, golden trunks pulled out of the sea, nuns, explosions, complex backstabbing plots, a very ambiguous romance, car chases, home invasions, kitchen sinks . . . wait, I can't remember if that last one was in the film. Even more amazingly (amusingly?), in Fangoria #240, producer Shawn Williamson was quoted as saying, ""We're spending much more time on story, being very meticulous about that"". Tara Reid called Alone in the Dark ""a smarter film"".

Let me not mislead anyone. A lot of that stuff above might sound yummy to the potential audience for this film, but the problem is that nothing has the slightest connection to anything else. I usually had no idea what any setting's relation was to any other setting, why we were there, or what anyone was doing (at least when each scene began). It's just a random mishmash of settings and clichés, as if director Uwe Boll had 250 unrelated ideas in a hat and pulled them out like lottery numbers. Then when he was done, he and editor Richard Schwadel decided to cut the film by using dice, then reassembled it by throwing the I Ching. Sometimes the film plays like an extended director's reel (which is a combination of short, varied, unrelated scenes that directors circulate to try to get work), but perhaps that's being too generous. I'm not sure Boll would get work if this were his reel.

Just as I tend to at least like most films, I tend to like most actors and most performances. It's very rare that I say that a performance was bad. Well, Tara Reid was bad here--and I'm someone who usually likes Reid. I don't know what happened. For a large percentage of the film, they just move her around the set like a prop. They might as well have just bought a blow-up doll. That would have saved them money that they could have used for some cgi ghosts and vampires in castle and graveyard settings. Maybe they chose to move her around like a pretty piece of driftwood after they saw the dailies of her mumbling nonsense dialogue in a monotone that's usually reserved for entertaining mother-in-laws.

And speaking of that dialogue, a lot of Alone in the Dark plays like a Godzilla film without Godzilla. By that, I mean that it's a lot of pseudo-scientific gobbledy-gook. At least in Godzilla films, there's a campiness to it, because they know how ridiculous it is, and there's a big payoff in that we get to see Godzilla destroy downtown and battle a giant gnat with radioactive death beams shooting from its eyes or something.

Just what Stephen Dorff and Christian Slater are doing here, besides overacting and filing lawsuits against their agents, is difficult to say. I can't say that I thought anyone in the film had a decent performance, although maybe Slater at least saw the cigar. I think that's unprecedented for me.

Still, I didn't give this film a 1. There was some competent cinematography, even if Boll and Schwadel made mincemeat out of it, and the hard rock tunes over the end credits were good. Heck, even the novelette prologue wasn't so bad. I actually thought the film had promise at that point. But this may just be the worst film I've ever seen with a budget of 20 million or more."
611,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Tara Reid as an intellectual, Christian Slater(usually great) as a dollar store Constantine and Stephen Dorff as...well it's STEPHEN DORFF FOR Christ SAKE!!!! I personally just want to thank those brilliant casting directors for the hard work and effort. You guys are on. Heres an idea, just my humble lowly opinion as the movie going public but it follows directly with your previous choices,a movie about the most brilliant neuro-physicist in history invent one pill to cure all diseases ever known to man and get this, heres the clincher they have to be played by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton.

613,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Based on the Atari video game , the film starts with a lengthy opening text . In fact this long prologue was added after several test audience members said they were confused by the screenplay . In 1967 mine workers discovered the first remnants of a long lost native American civilization , the Abkani . They believed there are two worlds on this planet . A world of light and a world of darkness .10.000 years ago , they opened a gate between these worlds . Before they could close it , something evil slipped through . They mysteriously vanished from the earth . Only a few artifacts remained hidden in the world's most remote place . These artifacts speak of terrifying creatures that thrive in the darkness , waiting for the day that the gate can be opened again .Later on , things go wrong when a saboteur breaks a gate and releases the monsters . They go throughout the gate and hell breaks loose . As some scientists , detectives (as Edward Carnby : Christian Slater ) , the beautiful anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) , and agents of the Bureau 713 (led by Cmdr. Richard Burke : Stephen Dorff) of the paranormal slowly unravel mysterious as well as suspenseful happenings with deadly and unexpected results . As a small team of agents to penetrate at an Alien-style complex .Evil awakens. Can mankind defeat the army of darkness unleashed by an ancient evil cult?

¨Alien¨ and ¨Resident Evil¨ Sagas are two good terror/action movies with a lot of attributes which this film version regrettably fails to emulate . Players of Atari's original role-playing adventure/terror game will know how terrifying it was . The main issue deals with creepy monsters made in 3D computer generator in which they are freed when a mysterious man makes the mistake of opening up a secret door between two worlds and letting them mayhem shuffle forth . The strange creatures , Alien-alike , take another pasting in the shoot'em up/monster movie rendition based on the famous video game from Atari . As our protagonists battle their way through the carnage before the final confrontation takes place . Breathtaking images , crossfire , spectacular battles and duels and lots of amusement and entertainment ; but being really mediocre , and sometimes embarrassing . And is added a brief love scene between Christian Slater and Tara Reid featuring a wonderful song in background . The efficient set up is not enough for delivering a nice movie , and the picture falls in ordinay topics , cliches and a salad of eerie monsters including various scenes with no much sense .

It packs an atmospheric but dark cinematography from Mathias Neumann . It contains a thrilling score , and the song that can be heard during the shooting sequence is ""Ghost"" by Mnemic and another famous song sung by Neneh Cherry and Youssou N'Dour during the love scenes titled ""Seven Seconds"" . The motion picture was middlingly made by Uwe Boll who poured a lot of money into special effects ; however , being deemed worst film of 2005 by the Stinkers Bad Movie Awards .All four of the films he has realized that were based upon video games, House of the Dead (2003), Alone in the Dark (2005), BloodRayne (2005) and BloodRayne II: Deliverance (2007) were listed on the bottom of barrel by the reviewers. Most of the other films he's directed, including Heart of America (2002), and Blackwoods (2002) are not widely available in several countries , but have received similarly low ratings among those who have seen them. Having directed 25 movies up to 2011, Boll is panned by the critics and he has received lousy reviews. Only recommended to those who amuse those kind of adventure/action/horror films or those enjoy in general of the Uwe Boll cinema .The film will appeal to fantasy/SciFi buffs with action enough to make it worth looking in on . In other words, it seem likely Terror/fantasy movies genre enthusiasts and juvenile viewers will be delighted because dash horror , action , fights , shots and adventures are thrillingly presented and edited to offer the maximum impact. Rating : 4 ; below average , though some moments results to be entertaining."
614,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"This film looks and feels like Sharknado. The effects are poor, some of the line readings are unintentionally funny, and the action sequences are cut to pieces to hide the frequent switching of actor and stunt double. In some ways it's a shame that this wasn't made by The Asylum. There was a golden opportunity to make a series of increasingly stupid films based off of rip-off xenomorphs climbing out of the shadow realm! Still, if they had done this we probably wouldn't have Stranger Things, and Reid got to take part in the Sharknado series eight years later anyway, so maybe it's for the best this never went any furt"
615,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Honestly, I can't be bothered to spend my time writing about this milestone of cinematic incompetence - life is simply too short. What I will say is that, Alone In The Dark succeeds in only three things: 1. It will make you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. It manages to throw several useless plots into the air but dropping all of them.

and

3. It utterly disgraces the classic PC game on which it is supposedly based by being a complete failure in all aspects of film-making.

Doctor Boll, if that is indeed what you are (I'm thinking proctology here), what on Earth are you doing in a director's chai"

617,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"On my list of ""worst movies ever made"".

There is nothing likable about this movie. It's totally worthless noise.

Honestly, I cannot think of one single redeeming moment... the story is stupid, the script is trite, the characters are 1-dimentional (as is the acting); I could care less if they lived or died. There's nothing special about the effects, nor the cinematography, nor the score. Several pointless scenes of mindless, ear-numbing shoot-em-up's that neither moved the plot along, nor offered any entertainment value, whatsoever.

No one should be subjected to this film, ever, under any circumstances. The only thing this film is really good for is fire kindl"
618,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"This should be my kind of movie. Even if it sucked, it still should have been right up my alley; hell, I like ""Congo,"" and ""Allan Quatermaine"" movies. I have a soft spot in my heart for silly alien/demon/adventure movies. Let's go over why I decided to watch this in the first place.

1. Horror/Sci-fi almost always intrigues me 2. I'm a big fan of archaeology, and this movie does involve a rare treasure. 3. Super-natural enemies with quality FX. 4. Christian Slater and Dorf I generally enjoy. 5. Tara Reid is hot.

So this movie had potential, at least in the cheese-horror section of the video store, but boy did it suck ass. The only redeeming aspects are Slater and Dorf, and not everyone finds them as entertaining as I do...I mean, let's face it, both are melodramatic. But now on to some of the many faults.

Tara Reid. Even though the movie as a whole is worse, Reid's performance is truly awful. We're not just talking bad, I'm talking about nominating Tara Reid for worst performance of the year. I don't know if she is capable of acting, but playing the museum curator is simply out of her league...completely. Watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist wasn't much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn. I mean this isn't just bad, it is laughably bad. Oh, and for those of you curious, she doesn't get naked, only down to a bra in a silly, totally unnecessary love scene.

Even with Reid's performance, perhaps the movie could have worked, but the plot is what dominates, and the plot seems written by a 10 year old. I hadn't realized this was a video game adaptation until AFTER watching the DVD, otherwise I would have appreciated the stupidity in real-time.

The storyline jumps back and forth from Slater's childhood at an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened, he has amnesia, of course. In his adult life Slater was recruited by some Unit 713, a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something. Slater had to leave because he was too rebellious, I guess, you never really know unless it was in one of those voice-overs I zoned out during. The movie starts with Slater hunting artifacts, obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with a ""Chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities."" I may have the exact quote wrong, but you get the idea.

There is an evil doctor that wants to unleash some hellions on earth (no reason given), experiments on children, super demon/alien-human hybrids, ""photonic"" bullets (the demon things can't stand sunlight) and, of course, Slater and Dorf to try to save everyone.

Jesus, I can't even being to wade through the clichéd elements. The script badly needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide SOME depth. I mean, why is this evil scientist so damn evil? Oh right, humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race. I guess he's infected? How did that happen? Oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself. How the hell did that happen? Why and where did he get the super slugs (oh yes, they use the old sci-fi stand by of parasitic aliens/demons which ""fuse"" with the spine of their host)Of course, Slater is, like Blade, half super-slug powered, but his slug ""didn't fully fuse due to an electrical shock,"" thank god. Oh, and the people with these ""fused"" spines, have no idea they're half-alien/demon and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies. Yeah we get zombies.

So lots of crap that could be entertaining, but none of it is.

Also, the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place...at least nothing a little dynamite can't handle.

Not the very worst thing you'll see, but a truly bad movie."
619,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"The title of worse film of all time is one that gets handed out quickly and often. Most of the time it is exaggeration of the fact but I would like to welcome Alone in the Dark to the short list of real candidates: Plan 9 from Outer Space, Battlefield Earth, and the Adventures of Pluto Nash.

As I watched the 90 minute bore I found it difficult to even stay awake even while I was trying so hard to laugh at the film. But alas I felt alone in the dark (I was gonna try to avoid the pun but I couldn't resist) as I looked around hoping to see Mike Nelson and his two robot friends. Alas my friends and I had to provide comedy throughout the film.

So... about the film itself. Lets talk about the action and effects since that should be the only positive part of the film. The film contains evil creatures that are a cross between the Xenos in Aliens (they even call them Xenos), and the creatures in Pitch Black. The can turn invisible at random (and I assure you it is random) and get hurt by light. Also present are small centipede creatures used to control humans that transform them into something resembling a zombie. All of these are shown with outdated special effects that would have been mediocre in 1997. The action scenes are chaotic and are impossible to follow. People shooting randomly on a blue screen stage or an empty set at monsters who were inserted in post. Light quickly flashes on a dark screen making your pupils burn from overwork while bad rock music blares in the background.

And those were the high points. The story revolving around a paranormal investigator (Slater) whose idea of looking tough is wearing a black wife beater Tshirt with a trench-coat and not shaving for 2 days. An archaeologist (Reid) who is rather inept. And a government agent(Dorff) whose lines involve barking order. All three should be ashamed at their performances (not that they have really ever done a good a job before) and the casting director should be ashamed. Reid and Slater are supposed to be lovers in the film I guess. The film contains the single most awkward love scene I have ever seen on film between the two.

Then comes the plot. Quiet frankly the parts that make sense are not interesting at all. The rest is illogical at best. The plot holes could contain the collective egos of all three stars. The film begins with text and a voice explaining the back-story. This opening lasts for over a minute and already the viewer knows they are in for something terrible. This opening narration is later repeated adnausem in the awkward dialog in a very clumsy and heavy handed fashion through the rest of the film. And the ending did not make one ounce of sense. Not only did it not make sense in the world of the film, it simply did not make sense.

Finally the direction of one Uwe Boll. Disgrace, thats all that can be said. His use of shaking the camera to simulate suspense. His lack of direction with the actors. Just watch Reid in scenes in which she is not center focus of the shot. The complete waste of special effects money for bullet time effects. And finally choosing to use voice over to explain something that should be painfully obvious to the viewers.

I payed a $1.50 to see this show at a second run theater. And while the laughs me and my friends provided made it worth every quarter I would advise people to avoid paying any more for this film. Grab about 3 friends and split the rental cost and tear this movie a new one.

Shame on you Uwe Boll. Shame on you Tara Reid. Shame on you Christian Slater. Shame on you Stephen Dorff. Shame on anyone who was associated with this film."
620,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"I give this movie a full ten stars due to the hilarity of its directors commentary, not because of any quality in the film (for there is none). When my brother rented House of the Dead, after his appalled viewing he watched it with the directors commentary to see ""what the hell the director was thinking"". And the commentary was better than the movie. So now we rent this guy's stuff just to laugh our asses off with his idiotic musings.

He actually believes that his movies are works of art!! You'll giggle uncontrollably when you watch Alone in the Dark (and any other Uwe Boll movie) with the commentary. He refers to his ending as ""Lynchian"" (for a reason that the viewer--nor, apparently, the director--can explain. He constantly makes fun of Tara Reid and complains that she doesn't take off her bra. He refers to every shamelessly ripped off scene as an ""homage"". Best of all, he complains that he is a misunderstood genius who has been unfairly criticized on this very site, IMDb. Chances are he is reading this review and others at this moment and plotting about how to incorporate his rebuttals into his next commentary track."
621,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Alone in the Dark is a series of still images edited together. Many of them are pictures of Christian Slater locked in a single facial expression, accompanied by flat, monotone narration. The film contains characters, as well as dialogue, a love interest, a conflict, and a resolution. There is an antagonist and a protagonist, sets and props, and scenes in which things occur. Then there's an ending which features credits. Not the tiniest scrap of a plot to be had.

It appears they made an attempt at a story involving a mad scientist trying to resurrect demons that wiped out an ancient race of people (why?); a young Slater escaped from his experiment and got electrocuted or lost his memory or something. Now the demons have been unleashed and Slater is their main target. I think. The movie suggests it. There then follow endless scenes of people walking around stealthily with their guns drawn, and a major plot point is made out of how cool and buff Slater is. Then I think Tim Conway pops in and insults him while giving him tips on golf... wait, what?... Oh, now it's *Stephen* Dorf? Well, I don't know anymore. I feel like Boll came into my living room for 96 minutes and just sat on my head.

Coleman Francis lives, and his name is Uwe Boll! 1/10"
622,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"It has only been recently that Uwe Boll's seeming masterpiece, Alone In The Dark, has been available here for rental. It completely bypassed local theatres, and was available on DVD in America at least a year before here, which is rarely a good sign. Unlike Boll's previous effort, House Of The Dead, the problem is not so much in the performances or even the special effects. The real problem lies in the direction and editing. Articles have since sprung out of the woodwork describing Boll's inflated self-opinion and inability to work effectively with collaborators. It seems that this includes actors. Reid and Slater do their best with the roles that they have been assigned, but it becomes clear that they are given very little direction throughout the film. At one point, Slater and Reid appear to be running from the Alien-like creatures of the story through a warehouse. To say that they interact very little with their surroundings is an understatement. This scene could have been more convincing, in fact, if they had been running across a floor with a rear-projection behind them.

No, the real problem in this film lies in the direction and editing. A sex scene appears with no linking into the preceding or following scenes. Adding to the film's woes is that test audiences were so confused by the plot that an opening crawl had to be added in order to make the plot easier to follow. Said plot basically follows Christian Slater, who looks nothing like the Edward Carnby of the video games, as he deals with supernatural creatures emerging in our plane of existence and a government agency attempting to deal with them. Exactly where this plot stems from, I do not know, and I have only briefly played one of the games, but I do not remember any of the embellishments Boll has provided (which telegraph themselves with fervor). Compounding the problem is that Boll requires his actors to describe the plot or the point of what we have seen in the scenes. That none of the plot can be inferred through the images makes Boll's incompetence as a director pretty obvious.

To hear it from Boll during the featurette, Atari contacted him and asked him to adapt the game into film. The nonsense of this spin is shown by what outsiders have to sayabout Boll and his films. The writers of a rejected screenplay for House Of The Dead decided that they would rather remain in obscurity than become famous for working with Boll. Speaking as a writer myself, this tells me far more about Boll as a filmmaker than a million featurettes from the lousy DVDs made of his lousy films ever could. Adding insult to injury is that Nuclear Blast paid Boll and his cohorts enough money to make an album in order to have a few of their bands included in the soundtrack. If there were justice in the world, Nuclear Blast would be one of the many record labels outselling Sony by a twelve to one ratio. They are innovators, and have released some masterpieces from the likes of Therion or Agathodaimon. That they have to slum it in dreck like this while Sony saturates the market in their repetitive garbage only adds further insult to Alone In The Dark. I hope that thirty grand could be written off easily.

Soundtracks and bad direction aside, the construction of the film is utterly terrible, too. I cannot really describe the ending for fear of ruining what little surprise the film has, but I bet that Uwe was paying very careful attention to the end of Resident Evil. It is a pity he did not learn that such images only work because of the context they are in, and that context needs to make a certain level of sense. I know it sounds hypocritical of me to call for a film to guide the audience through the plot, but at the very least, Alone In The Dark could have given a small breadcrumb trail, anything to make point A follow logically from point B, so to speak. The idea that we are meant to follow all this action going on in such a confined space, and then accept that some survivor got out and destroyed everyone (even the meaning of everyone is left pretty vague in this film) is pretty ludicrous. Others have described the patent unbelievability of Tara Reid as an archaeologist, but this is in fact one of the least of the film's problems.

I gave Alone In The Dark a two out of ten. As a horror film, it is far too tame to horrify. As an action film, it is too stagnant to move the audience. As a serious acting piece, it has no drama to speak of. Without the lousy or idiotic production decisions, it also loses the unintentional comedy that made House Of The Dead bearable. In essence, it winds up in no man's land. See it if you need an example of how one man can be so blind to his own incompetence."
623,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"I know that a lot of people have spent a lot of time writing wonderful reviews of this film that really describe in vivid detail how awful this movie truly is. I wanted to do the same thing, but after watching this film, I went to my doctor and he told me that I was now mildly retarded. He didn't know I had seen this movie the night before, so he ran a bunch of tests and kept saying ""I just don't get it..."" over and over, but that is a story for a different time.

All I can say is that whatever this movie is supposed to be, it isn't. Was it supposed to be scary/suspenseful? Maybe, if your idea of scary/suspenseful is coming downstairs as a little kid on Christmas morning to see if you got a brand new bike, and instead you find your father naked and he throws strawberry jelly in your face and punches you in your nutsack. Confused? So was I when I watched this movie.

Was this film supposed to be a horror film? Oh, it was a horror. Kind of like if your Mom wanted to scare neighborhood children on Halloween, so she put on a devil mask and painted bullseyes on her nipples and had the kids shoot her in the tits with BB guns. Would that be horrible? Sure would, just not in the way it was intended to be. Kind of like this movie; its not a horror movie, its a horror of a movie.

About 3/4 of the way through the movie I inexplicably started beating my girlfriend. That's right. This film was so bad it made me an abuser. It has also been traced as a root cause of alcoholism, epilepsy, dick cancer, and gingivitis. Oh,. and Stepehen Dorf is in it, so what did I expect? That guy is a no-talent ass clown."
624,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Well, what can you say about a movie whose ""soldiers"" are equipped with paintball protections, even the weapons look like they are taken from paintball. This movie is a Mimic and Aliens rip-off, among others. Even the sex scene is really crappy . It amazes me how this Uwe Boll guy is still allowed to make movies, or even that he gets the money to make them. I mean, at one point, one of the dead ""soldiers"" starts moving before they change the scene. At least that made me laugh. This is the third movie made by Uwe Boll that I watch, the others two being ""In the name of the king"" and ""1968:Tunnel Rats"". They were both way worse, I didn't even get to laugh with those. I think that this Uwe Boll guy should make a last movie in which a character is send from the future to kill his mother before his birth, achieving such task, and then not make any more mov"
625,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Anyone aspiring to become a movie director should definitely watch Uwe Boll's films. Every single one, it seems, contains everything that's bad about bad movies. Alone in the Dark is, of course, not an exception.

The plot is utterly pretentious, boring, predictable and nowhere even remotely near immersive; the acting is among the dullest I've ever had the profound lack of pleasure not to be able to avoid witnessing; the characters are so flat they might as well be cardboard cutouts (not to mention they are all completely unlikable); and the camera work is so shaky and uneven that I actually got a headache. Not to mention the sound, music and special effects might in fact cause brain hemorrhage.

Here's an example: somewhere near the middle of the movie, there's a fight scene. It is set in a room which is almost completely black. Almost the entire scene consists of closeups of the various guns' muzzles as they fire, and the camera won't stop shaking. It's completely disorientating and impossible to follow for several minutes, and then the fight suddenly ends (and thankfully the noisy music along with it). That's about as good as it gets.

In short: this movie is garbage. It's not hard to understand why Uwe Boll has to finance his own films."
626,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"It is so bad I can't believe Tara Reid accepted the role. Director is horrible!!!!! I've seen better Directing and Plots on Skinemax late night! Wish I could get back the 45 minutes I lost before I fell asleep!

To anyone reading this; please do not spend money on this video! I spent $2.00 at blockbuster and returned the movie, saying my DVD player didn't like it. When asked if I wanted to try another copy, I responded that I was in agreement with my DVD player and would like to find a different movie.

I am convinced that even Season 1 of 'Different Strokes' would be more entertaining than this film.

The plot involves paranormal investigator Edward Carnby checking out a new case that involves a stupid plot to bring about the end of the world by unleashing these creatures that are brought to life by cheap computer effects.

629,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"after reading all the dooming reviews, calling it the worst movie ever or boll the worst director i expected some good trash-fun à la future war, but really: all this criticism has absolutely no valid base, its just far far from reality, its a whitchhunt

its not even a real trash-movie, there are a few scenes where you may roll eyes or laugh like a sudden sex scene riot along with a quite inappropriate ""7 seconds"" in the background, but there are many things the movie does just right, even though it takes a lot of inspiration from existing movies of the genre you hardly ever get the impression of really stolen or already seen scenes, the creators even experiment with own methods of staging

the camera-work is really well done most of the time, its versatile and entertaining, sometimes its even experimental - partly successful, for example the distorted zooms

same for the action-scenes, they are also very well done, its good martial arts and has some unique ideas

a part where this movie really shines is the staging of the monsters, in this regard it achieves much more than many competitors of the genre, it doesn't have to avoid the comparison with movies like ""the relic"" here, the beasts look excellent and are superb animated, some scenes are really among the best you can find in any of the alien-clones, for example when professor Hudgens stands on a hill sending out his ""dark minions"", a really nice scene, or the look into a deep cave filled with monsters, or a beast going up in steam - its really excellent, even more if you consider the less than mediocre budget of this movie

the acting is absolutely sufficient, slater remains a bit colorless, Reid has some short weak moments, but overall its just fine for this kind of movie, even some extras can keep a good straight face which is not the rule

except for a somewhat edgy flow, some awkward scenes and a slightly clumsy introduction there is absolutely nothing wrong with this, you see that boll is still exercising but its solid monster-movie entertainment nevertheless

boll-movies have become a shrine for bad movie-jokes, but they all get less funny once you ve seen the movies because they are just not that bad, its no ""future war"" and boll is no ed wood, maybe its because there is a German director buying American actors which annoys the people, or maybe they just continue what disappointed fans of the game started, its funny how even the ""big critics"" join the group of bashing monkeys but well: a study says that 60 percent of the internet users use message boards only to relieve their frustration... :o)

""the breed"", ""reign of fire"", ""starship troopers 2"", ""species 2"", ""alien vs predator"", ""28 days later"" ... after all there are a lot of similar flawed, as bad and worse movies with higher budgets out there, alternatively just switch your TV on and watch one of the countless right wing series like ""4400"" or ""surface""...

if you are a fan of the monster genre and like to see some unique and well animated beasts i really recommend this one, the movie around it is entertaining enough"
630,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Some people count sheep when they wan't to get to sleep, I just stick on an Uwe Boll film and I'm out.

It took me two sittings to get through this film. I can't even begin to give you even a vague 1 sentence synopsis because nothing in this film has stuck, it is that tragic. What has stuck however is just how awful of an experience this film was, YES that has unfortunately stuck like a hot steaming rancid pile of dog sh!t to the bottom of a fresh sparkling brand new Nike Air Max shoe :(

I'm afraid I will have to carry this film to the grave. It's Uwe Boll movies like this which sometimes make me wish we live in an 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' totalitarian society with the ability to write horrific works like this out of our history forever, but unfortunately for us all this society has not arrived yet.

My conclusion it that Uwe Boll is still continuing his quest to De-evolve the standards of cinema with yet another super-turkey. If we continue to fund the 'Uwe Boll's' of this world then it is our own fault that we have got the plethora of endless non-stop dreck coming into our cinemas week-in week-out.

Well, ""Alone In The Dark"" solves both problems! Virtually scare-free, this tepid, spectacularly uninteresting gunfight, er, movie features virtually no scares, but plenty of buff, pretty men in military fatigues running around with their hands on their pen^h^h^h machine guns, firing at whatever it is they're supposed to be fighting at in the movie. There's some tossed-off gobbledygook about Native American artifacts which do... something...

From the many bad reviews I was seeing this to see how bad it could be. Why Ultraviolet ( a vampire flick like Bloodrayne) isn't also rated as badly as Alone in the Dark can only be because of the hot lead actor. Ultraviolet is so much worse than Alone in the Dark.

The story was simple to follow, the acting at most times decent. Reid really didn't suit her role though.

635,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"For all people who thinks Uwe Boll should never do another film: The solution is easy. DON'T see the films he is making. Don't pay for them and DON'T talk about them.

As they say all publicity is good publicity. And Hollywood will keep giving him money as long as they get their money back with a little bit of profit. That's how it goes in Hollywood. They don't care if a film is good or bad as long as they make money of it.

If you watch his films just to see how bad they are so you can tell other people you are an idiot. If you watch his films to have a good time laughing at the bad dialogue or crappy acting/directing you are like me... A B-Movie Lover. It's nothing to be ashamed over. I love crappy funny movies.

I can't say his films are good but there are definitely worse directors and there are a whole lot of worse movies than Uwe's. Maybe not in the same ""budget"" class but still. He seems to make the money back to the producers and that's all that counts in the end for him to keep making them.

Those who watch His films so they can spread the word about how bad they are: It's like going to McDonalds and eating every week and then complaining that McDonalds have the worst food ever? It's stupid and pointless. And if someone ask you why you eat at McDonals all the time you would answer:

""Alone in the Dark"" starts out with the semblance of a plot, though this gets lost about halfway through, at which point the movie degenerates into a sort of mindless CGI shoot-out. The production values aren't bad, but self-conscious direction tends to prevent the viewer from being pulled into the story. If you think about it, however, these same generalizations could be made about a lot of movies, some of which have achieved substantial commercial and critical success.

638,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Based on a popular yet aged video game I was surprised to see this was even a thing seeing as I had never heard much about the old or later games.

I was actually a huge fan of the latest Alone In The Dark game (2008) and I like Christian Slater as an actor so I was expecting to have an enjoyable lazy watch. However this was not the case with the very simple and bland script, visual effects that seemed very aged and the overall disappointing film.

I could have afforded to go on a tangent or two with the characters and story and defiantly needed to be slowed down.

It's defiantly not a film worth checking "
639,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Whenever people think of Uwe Boll, they think of all of his films that can be considered bad. (If not terrible) And the film that most people point to as one of his worst is the 2005 release ""Alone in the Dark."" (Heck, it's the one I've seen many claim to be THE worst film he's made... and others claim it to be perhaps one of the worst films of all time.) It's the one that seems to get the most attention. The most publicity. And of course, the most hate.

I'm not in that camp, though. Oddly enough. In fact, I'd be willing to argue that despite being a fairly terrible film, ""Alone in the Dark"" to me is arguably one of his best video-game-to-film adaptations. Something about it comes off as borderline ""So bad, it's good"" to me. And I honestly found it to be perhaps the best-directed film in his entire filmography, at least from a visual/composition standpoint.

The film follows paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), as he struggles against various otherworldly threats, including deadly creatures, underground caverns, the delusions of a mad scientist, and other forces. At the same time, he reconnects with an old flame (Tara Reid) and comes to odds with government Bureau 713 and a former comrade. (Stephen Dorff.)

The acting is... well. You know. ...bad. Slater is trying and seems to be having a blast, but he's still quite wooden. Reid is amusingly-bad in her attempts to come off as smart and serious. Dorff is probably the best, giving the only performance that seems SLIGHTLY decent. (Though still both over-done and under-done depending on the scene.) And supporting characters are all around the level of ""meh.""

The script is a fairly incomprehensible mess. From scene to scene, you can't really grasp what's happening, what's relevant (or irrelevant), what character motivations are, etc. There's a lot of bizarre leaps in focus and there isn't really any clearly defined focus or main conflict. The film seems to be made up of various meandering subplots that don't quite fit together. In addition, the cinematography is bland. The music is sub-par. Effects range from ""excellent"" (some early bullet-time effects, while tacky, are very well-executed) to ""awful."" (Some of the creature effects being laugh-out-loud bad.) And there's a lot of little issues here and there throughout the production and presentation.

This SHOULD be a 1 out of 10 film for sure. But there's just something about it. I just can't bring myself to give it that score.

In part, it's because I do honestly believe that this is one of Boll's better films. And I believe that here, he shows off perhaps the best visual direction of his entire career. It actually has a few really cool shots that are well-composed, there's at least some creativity shown (even though it doesn't work) through attempts to be moody or exciting with key sequences, and it has the most style out of anything he's really done. Don't get me wrong... the film still isn't particularly well-directed. But it seems to have the most effort put in by Boll out of any of his films. It isn't cheap and rushed like ""House of the Dead"", nor overly ""gritty"" and sloppy like everything he's done lately. It looks the most like an actual decently-budgeted movie out of all of his films.

In addition, something about this movie strikes me very-much as a great example of ""so bad, it's good."" Whether it be chuckling at lazy attempts to make characters look smart (giving Tara Reid glasses, for example), or poorly-executed action beats... I find this film very likable and entertaining because of how bad it is. And that counts for something.

I think that this is definitely not Boll's worst film at all. I don't even think it's in his bottom-5. I found it amusingly bad, and with a surprising amount of style and effort. And that effort alone makes it better than much of his other work.

I give this a very-bad 3 out of 10. Fans of bad movies (like me) should definitely give it a shot. You just might find it entertaining!"
640,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"I'm in no hurry to get in the boxing ring with director Uwe Boll, a man who has been known to use his pugilistic skills to silence his less favourable critics, but I have got to say that this horror/action film (apparently based on an Atari video game) is utterly diabolical—far worse than I ever expected (my opinion of Boll had been reasonably high after seeing Rampage, which was surprisingly effective).

The long-winded opening narration is the first clue that this is going to stink: ancient civilisations, evil creatures from another world, a secret organisation devoted to investigation of the paranormal, and a mad scientist experimenting on orphaned children are clumsily thrown together in an attempt to establish the background to the film, but they only succeed in confusing the viewer before things have even begun. Matters are made even more incomprehensible with a prologue that occurs '22 years ago' but which segues into the present day and proceeds to introduce even more mind-bogglingly random elements to ensure that even the most astute of viewers will be completely baffled.

As the film progresses, more and more nonsensical garbage is haphazardly thrown into the mix, Boll's pointless directorial stylisms making everything impossible to follow, with the occasional voice-over by Christian Slater (intended to help explain matters) only adding to the embarrassment factor. Ridiculous voice-overs aside, Slater's performance isn't all that bad, but his co-star Tara Reid is absolutely terrible and was clearly hired for her looks (yet she doesn't even have the decency to take off her bra during the obligatory sex scene!).

After much frenetic shooting, a smattering of reasonably fun gore, some choice snippets of lousy dialogue ('Some doors are meant to stay shut') and lots of naff CGI creature attacks, during which Boll throws in some lousy Indiana Jones-style adventure and a scene completely ripped off from James Cameron's Aliens (the Xenos—yes the monsters ARE called that—obliterate a team of soldiers, despite the use of automated sentry guns), the film wraps up leaving the viewer none the wiser about what they have witnessed."

642,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"One comment stated that this awful ""film"" was the Citizen Kane of bad movies. True enough but I would go even further. In the novel ""1984"" and various film versions of ""1984"", the hero of the story, Winston Smith, was told, after being tortured by the state for an extensive period of time, the worst torture for him was waiting in room 101 which contained his worst nightmare. We remember that Winston had been terrified of rats ever since childhood because his mother had been killed by rats.

When Winston was put in room 101 by Big Brother's henchman, a rat cage was placed on Winston's face and he was told that the guard on the cage protecting him from the hungry rats would be removed unless he renounced his love for Julia and swore loyalty to ""Big Brother"".

After watching this movie last night on T.V. it is my opinion that had Winston been given a choice between viewing this ""movie"" and telling ""Big Brother' to remove the protective guard on the cage, I am confident that Winston would have said, ""I'll take the rats please""."

The acting was a huge nose bridge rub. It wasn't even funny, bad acting. I wanted every character to die. My favorite line was, ""The hair on the back of my neck just stood up."" Tara Reid. That line was almost as useless as this movie. The action was awful. The guns were shooting a special round, but it made it seem like they were shooting tracer rounds. Also the monsters were poorly designed. They were invisible half the time, so it looked like the guys were shooting laser beams at nothing. Plus, the outfits were paintball gear. Each character looked like they were children playing war.

647,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Some of the hatred for this film has been exaggerated. Sometimes people like to have something to rag on no matter what - right now, for the Internet film community, it seems to be Uwe Boll - and judging from quotes I've read by him, as well as movies I've seen, he deserves a lot of it.

But some of the hatred goes too far. ""BloodRayne"" was already on the IMDb Low 100 before it even really got launched into theaters.

I'll give you an example of the exaggeration regarding this film: One critic I read claimed the opening narration went on for nearly ten minutes, however it lasts perhaps a minute at the most.

The dialogue is pretty bad, and the beginning with Christian Slater telling a young child on a plane that his mother is wrong about being afraid of the dark is unintentionally hilarious. There are other gems such as, ""Looks like a dead end up ahead. I better take a look."" Or how about Tara Reid - a supposed archaeologist (hah!) - referring to Newfoundland as ""New Found Land."" I read here on IMDb that Reid was invited on Jay Leno and wasn't even able to give a definition of her profession in the film.

Christian Slater I pretty much just felt sorry for throughout the film - he's such a good actor and his resorting to crap like this and ""Hollow Man 2"" is a real shame. I am still hoping he makes a comeback. For what it's worth his performance here actually rises above the laughable material.

The special effects are pretty bad, but once again not nearly as bad as I was expecting after reading some message board posts here.

Overall I was expecting something so bad I would have a fun time laughing at it. Unfortunately this film is not laugh-out-loud bad, it's just plain BAD. It's not the worst film ever made - it's not on par with Ed Wood - it is actually just equivalent to most Z-grade straight-to-video flicks out there. If Boll's name had not been attached to the project and it hadn't attracted a theatrical run, I'm sure it would have a slightly higher rating on here and less of a ""fan base"" so to speak.

I'm not supporting the film or saying it's remotely good - it isn't - but I am saying it's about as bad as any other straight-to-video horror garbage.

I wouldn't recommend it because I didn't even have a fun time watching it for giggles - it's just a really lame film that takes itself way too seriously and perhaps its only positive attribute is that it has some amount of (admittedly ripped-off) style."

Normally, i would try to give you a synoposis of the plot, but there is no plot here! In the beginning of the movie, there is this long ass text scroll that is like if they took the opening Star Wars scroll and made it as boring as possible and guess what... it makes no sense! As for the main star in the movie: Christian Slater, as bad as he was in The Wizard, he is so much worse here. He isn't even trying here. In fact, no one here in the cast is trying. I hope that those checks contained a lot of 0's. Alone in the Dark contains one of Uwe Boll's most annoying trademarks, and that is the awful action sequences. They are all shot in such boring angels, that I almost fell asleep during them. Plus, they are literally shot in the dark so you cant tell what is happening. The special effects in this movie are so bad, even Stephen Sommers would say ""Damn do those effects look bad."" There are parts so bad I almost felt embarrassed, like in one scene a soldier was supposed to be dead and yet while people are walking away she lifts her head up. I mean, how did that get past editing? Some people say that Uwe Boll is the new Ed Wood, no, at leat Ed Wood had a passion for filmmaking, Uwe Boll on the other hand just doesn't give a crap. I would say that he is the least talented director in Hollywood, but I believe we all know which infamous duo has earned that title(Hint hint: They directed Vampires Suck and Disaster Movie)."
653,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Maybe I've been desensitized from watching too many bad movie lately but, in my opinion, Alone in the Dark is not much worse than any other lackluster action movie. The plot has more or less been replaced by massive amounts of gunfire and, perhaps as an afterthought, giant dumps of exposition in the form of voice-over monologue. Moreover, the acting is a bit wooden and the dialog is kind of sub par but then again, there are many action movies that suffer from similar problems.

One major annoyance with this film though is the darkness, yes, darkness would naturally be an integral part of a film called Alone in the Dark but having nearly all the action take place in near complete darkness ruins the film as it makes it impossible to see whats going on; this is especially poignant in one scene where pretty much all the light comes from the muzzle flashes of the guns. The lack of proper characters doesn't help either, in the end you have a bunch of cardboard cutouts that you can't see (due to the darkness) and don't care about, the result of which is and utterly unengaging action flick."
654,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Oh, Uwe Boll, your name over time has become synonymous with 'bulls*** video game adaptation'. It's all his fault, too; with the exception of Postal, anything that was once a property in a bit-system has been taken by Boll with his Germany tax-credit-shaved dollars (or as he says in Postal with real hilarity, Nazi gold) will be made bad with his style of dull camera-work and unimaginative and uninspired action set pieces. At best he can garner a few points for some bad-movie fun at times, but the product over all is so poorly produced throughout, from its overwrought writing to the mis(or WTF)casting, to simple things like music and weaponry characters use, or the designs of the monsters or whatnot. Case in point, Alone in the Dark, given a 9% out of 100% on metacritic (about the worst critical average one can get without being Paris Hilton), promises to perhaps be something extremely stupid and badly made but fun... and it's ultimately too dull to care at all.

The plot is so convoluted that you would have to be the biggest slobbering geek for Alone in the Dark the video game (and hell if I know any of them), and it mostly just concerns some paranormal investigator with memory loss and who is an orphan (Christian Slater) teaming up with an archaeologist chick (Tara Reid, who else), and some other prickly paranormal guy (Stephen Dorff) all trying to track some creatures that have escaped from a crypt off of a ship from God knows where over God knows what and blah blah. Yeah, blah blah is a good word to give it, especially with the opening text scrawl going on so long as to make any of the Star Wars opening texts look like log-lines. Honestly, one would come to this at most expecting some cheesy-stupid dialog for the actors to chew on, and even in THIS it's a failure; Slater's narration sounds like it was made at gunpoint via ludes, and Dorff looks confused at to why he's even acting next to Tara Reid. We are too, Stephen.

The monsters or whatever look cheap even in CGI, the action and gun battles are lazily staged and not exciting, and when it should come time to be ""scared"", the director and his so-called DoP just flicker lights on and off. That's right, your six year old would have more imagination than these clowns. It might not be so offensive except that it's chiefly a time-waster that promises to suck in a fun way. I'm not sure what's more taxing on the audience, that a lot happens and none of it, not an iota, is interesting, or that a couple of actors we might've liked in other films are put through the motions of a script that would barely get by the people at SyFy channel. The ending, by the way, is retarded into such a way that it makes only minimal sense, and then gives an Evil Dead ripoff that is just staggering.

While watching the movie Alone in the Dark, I was bored and more engaged chatting with my friends as it went from one big action ramp up to another with the same pale-faced actors and incompetent special effects went along. But thinking and writing about the movie now, it boils me just thinking about going through the experience just for the sake of a few laughs. It's laugh-less. Worthless.

This movie was once in IMDb's 'down 100' and it had a perfect spot there, here's why.

I would like to start out with a small introduction to the director of this movie, Uwe Boll. Uwe is a ex-boxer from Germany who spends his time making self-funded (or sometimes government funded) movies based on popular licenses, mostly videogames. Uwe is a man who rather fights his critics then listening to them, and openly admitted that he NEVER played any of the videogames that he based his movies on. Uwe Boll therefore is the worst possible choice to direct a movie based on a video game, and it is as good as hiring a director to do a movie based on a book he never even read. Uwe Boll is compared to the British director Paul WS Anderson a lot of times, but at least Paul WS Anderson creates movies with reverences to the games he based his movies on.

Alone in the Dark is a video game series that I always had a passion for. Its a classic survival horror game that doesn't rely on big and loud gunfights or armies of monsters swarming around. Alone in the Dark is the kind of game that does its title justice; its best played in the dark. The gameplay, the dialog, and the whole mystery of the mansion you roam in has a atmosphere that few games can match these days. Even Atari's latest attempt to revive the Alone in the Dark franchise has shown us that big special effects and good looking graphics aren't everything. But what do we get with the movie? Loud action scenes, corny dialog, paperthin characters and plot... From that point on I just wanted to punch mister Uwe Boll in the face (in pure boxing-fashion) for completely turning a great franchise into a travesty that has literally nothing to do with the source-material.

Carnby looks and acts nothing like the character he is supposed to be playing from the games. Heck, he doesn't even remotely look anything like a detective to begin with, and his overall performance is horrible. There is also little or no explanation about his character, or any other character for that matter. The only thing that matters in this film are the CGI-monsters (that have no relevance to the monsters in any of the games either) and the loud action-scenes (including really tiresome slow-motion effects) and even that is executed very poorly. There is basically no acting in this film, and everyone seems to have only one neutral expression.

If you by any chance stumbled on this title, I recommend buying or renting the games, especially the first one. When you played that, and then still want to watch this movie you will most probably agree with my frustration. I don't usually 'boycot' any director, since movies are usually a personal piece of art taken from the perspective of the director and producer, but I avoid any movies from Uwe Boll. I don't care if he improves his directing, the lack of humor in his movies, the overall shoddy production, poor characterization and lots of plot holes because I'm not going to watch it. He can direct a modern equivalent of The Godfather for all I care, and I'm still not going to watch it. I'm not going to sit through the crap that he calls film-making ever again. The fact that I even saw this movie TWICE (once alone, once with friends) is something that was a complete and utter waste of my time and I urge anyone to stay away from any movie that Uwe Boll is involved in. He doesn't care about film-making, he doesn't care about story, he doesn't care about the games, he only cares about your wallet."

660,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"After House of the Dead, I thought Uwe Boll had a decent chance of redeeming himself, because how could one make a movie as bad as (or heaven forbid worse) HotD? Well, it seems as though one can, and that one is the man himself, Uwe Boll. Alone in the Dark is just bad, plain and simple, there is nothing good about it at all. It is basically a mish-mash of crap. Acting? Wooden. Script? A mess. Music? Unbearable. Characters? Random. Directing? ..........

Right from the start I knew it was heading up **** creek without a paddle when (Texas Chain Saw Massacre style), text started scrolling up the screen while a narrator reads it out in a deadpan voice. What I found strange was the text basically gave away the twist, and for the rest of the movie it was about the main character Edward Carnby (Christian Slater, who obviously needed a paycheck) trying to unravel the mystery of which we already know the details of. Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff also pop by to pick up a paycheck and add no life to their cardboard characters. However, my beef is not with the actors, but with the stupid story and direction. The main problem with the story was I understood very little of it, it just made no sense. Random pieces of story were thrown in here and there with no explanation (what the hell was the old professor doing in the forest commanding all the creatures?) and the scenes all looked cut and pasted into the movie. One minute the two main characters are making love (where and why I couldn't quite work out) and the next they are shooting aliens with twenty SWAT guys in the same building. And of course, this fight was accompanied by random camera movement, strobe lighting and heavy metal music.

I am going to stop now, because I could write an essay about the stupidity of Alone in the Dark and Uwe Boll. Basically, avoid this movie like the plague it is, go watch ANYTHING else, but just ignore this load of trash.

663,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"There's a lot of negative things to be heard about this movie, and to a certain degree its true. There's some really huge plot holes, there's some really stupid dialogue in it, and of course, there's Tara Reid, who is simply unacceptable for the role of a scientist (or any role in a movie thats not a ""teen movie"").

But those negative points cast aside, the movie IS enjoyable, if you accept it for what it is, a simple action b-movie with some horror elements (not really scary though), monsters and gore. The effects are okay - not top notch but its about what can be expected with this kind of budget. While I'm not a close follower of the video game series, I know that there is only very limited similarity between movie and game - i.e. the main character, the title, possibly some plot ideas but thats about it. The game series is based on horror elements mainly, while the movie is 90% action and almost no horror, so if you're a huge fan of the games you'll almost certainly be disappointed, otherwise there's a chance you'll find it okay."

We have an early winner! There's NO WAY that there can be any movie released in 2005 that is worse then this. It's ""Hudson Hawk"" bad. Tara Reid has got to be the absolute worst actress employed today. Just awful. I rarely write reviews but I had to rush to the nearest computer to save people from this Piece O' Crap!!!! People were walking out of the movie left and right... Mainly Left!!! I have never seen this happen before. If you go see this movie you are an idiot and if you actually enjoy it you need to be shot.

I'm now embarrassed to say that I saw this movie first day it came out. I was excited and was enthused after watching the previews. The movie started bad. You know it's an awful film when the opening intro (ALA Star Wars) is dumb and the guy doing the voice over has a lisp. Stay away from this God awful movie whatever you "
665,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"This was the worst movie any of us have ever seen. Usually when I see a movie I absolutely loathe I might say something like ""one of the worst movies ever"" or ""one of the worst movies I've ever seen"". Not the case this time unfortunately. I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt, I simply can not recollect any movie I've seen (let alone any movie I've seen which was at one point released in theaters) which was worse than this. I don't so much mind that the special effects in this movie aren't even on par with the likes of the boring garbage they send straight to the sci-fi channel. I don't mind so much that there isn't one good performance in this movie. Here's my problem with this movie. We get a 2 minute backstory/ history lesson on the history and culture of an ancient Indian tribe that is nothing more than white letters on black screen. When the movie starts, it has just about nothing to do with anything we just saw. The movie continues like this for the next hour and 40 minutes. it felt like there were like....eight eighths of eight different movies which, just coincidentally had the same cast members, edited onto one film strip. The entire movie is incredibly disjointed and leaves so many plot holes it's unbearable. To me it felt like every scene which moved the ""plot"" forward was just introducing new and random pieces of the puzzle which don't even fit together. Nothing ever ties back to anything. Not to mention the AWESOME slow mo wire work hand to hand fights which look nothing short of ridiculous and out of place and gun fights which use some ""video game-izing"" techniques which would look sub par and stupid on the console video game system that the game of the same name was originally released on.

Just so none of you get it twisted.....I refused to pay money for this movie so i bought a ticket for million dollar baby and snuck in to this.....trust me....go see million dollar baby.

The only way I can recommend this movie is if you'd like to know what the worst movie all time would look like so that you can appreciate every other movie you'll ever see more."
666,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"It should come as no shock to you when I say that Alone in the Dark is a crappy movie. To put it bluntly, it's as if a dung monster defecated, ate the result, and then vomited. The final product would still outshine this movie.

Seemingly based on an ancient (!) Atari video game, the movie has something or other to do with a portal to the bowels of the earth, the unleashing of demons, and ancient civilizations. Something about there being two worlds, that of darkness and that of light. (Guess which one's ours.) Oh, and 10,000 years ago a really super-duper advanced civilization opened the portal, demons came over and had a blast, then wiped out the civilization. Which is why we've never heard of them, conveniently enough.

Christian Slater, perhaps pining for the days of Heathers and Pump up the Volume, plays Edward Carnby, a paranormal researcher to whom Something Bad happened when he was 10 years old. He's hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of said advanced civilization. Carnby used to be part of a secret institution called 713, which has been trying to figure out what happened to that long-ago civilization. But Carnby believed he wasn't going to be able to find the answers he sought, so he left the group.

But see, these beasties are out, and they get their prey in varying ways, such as gutting them, splitting them down the middle, implanting neurological control devices in them, or just turning them into killing zombies. Yes, it's another zombie movie.

That's about as distilled I can make the plot. It's pretty convoluted and incomprehensible. In similar movies, one might see the intrepid researcher/adventurer figure things out a step at a time, and when we the audience are mentally with the researcher, it's a lot of fun. But when the scenes shift from attack to attack with no perspective or context... not so much fun.

The acting is dreadful, save for Slater, who (although he almost seems embarrassed to be in the movie) showed he was capable of carrying the acting load. He had to; get this - Tara Reid is cast as a museum curator! Honest to goodness, I thought I'd seen the casting of a lifetime when Denise Richards was cast as a nuclear physicist in Tomorrow Never Dies. But Reid here matches Richards, crappy emoting for crappy emoting. Hightlights include Reid pronouncing ""Newfoundland"" as ""New Fownd Land,"" Reid delivering most of her lines in a dazed, throaty monotone (kinda like she'd been on an all-night bender for the past week before filming), Reid - a museum curator, mind you - spending a lot of the movie in a midriff-bearing top and hip-hugger jeans. Oh yeah, she was as believable as Jessica Simpson giving stock quotes. Oh, why must the pretty ones be so dumb? (Note: I don't think Tara Reid's all that good looking. She looks like she's in perpetual need of food.) Almost everyone else in the cast is completely forgettable, except perhaps for Steven Dorff, who played Burke, one of the leaders of 713. Dorff's character wasn't terribly well developed, but nothing in the movie was, from the sets to the characters to Tara Reid. But I digress.

Anyway, the perplexing and utterly preposterous storyline is tough enough to follow with the film moving at such a breakneck pace, but director Uwe Boll tosses in a pounding, mind-deadening soundtrack; it's so loud you can't hear what the actors are saying in some of the scenes! That can't be right. Given the acting level, however, perhaps thanks are in order to Mr. Boll.

Oh, and a fun note. The opening moments of the movie include narration... of the words that are crawling across the screen at the same time. Remember the first Star Wars? You heard that now-familiar Star Wars theme while the prologue crawled. There was surely no need for narration; why do I need some doofus to read what's on the screen for me? Were the producers simply looking out for blind people? Maybe that also explains why the soundtrack was so loud - they were also looking out for hard-of-hearing people. Also, the narrator inexplicably had a lisp for the first few lines of the crawl - then lost it. Bizarre.

Alone in the Dark is a loud, dopey mishmash of dreadful acting, an incoherent script, and ham-handed directing. Hardly a note rings true. There's so much chaos that the audience simply gives up caring about the characters and roots for their demise. Even in the dark, the demonic creatures seem cooler and much more developed by comparison.

Ironically, since there were only three other people in the theater, I watched this Alone in the Dark. I wonder if Uwe Boll planned it that way? I can't quite give this the lowest rating, because I had low hopes for it to begin with - and because it never grabbed me enough for me to get worked up about it. It's atrocious, although Slater redeems himself a tiny bit."
667,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Alone in the Dark is not a film for the faint of heart, nor the faint of patience. Just a word of warning.

It begins 22 years ago, when Professor Hudgens took 20 orphans and subjected them to bizarre and unprecedented experiments in the hopes of saving the human race. Basing his research on material culled from archaeological digs for an ancient tribe called the Abskani, Hudgens succeeds and hides his work from everyone  including the government that funded it. As his experiments come to a close, one of the orphans, named Edward Carnby, escapes and makes off into the wild to live free from Hudgens' controlling influence.

Now fully grown, Carnby dedicates his life to exploring paranormal activity across the globe. Once a member of the secret government unit Bureau 713, he has become a one-man agency, and finds that his latest discovery, a small ring-shaped artifact, may hold the key to a recent increase in paranormal activity around the world. Reuniting with his estranged archaeologist girlfriend Aline Cedrac, Carnby begins to search for answers and hopefully save the world.

What he soon discovers is that Bureau 713, led by Agent Richard Burke, is similarly aware of the recent surge in activity, and determined to find the same solution he now frantically searches for. Reluctantly joining with Burke, Carnby begins to unravel the web of mystery that surrounds his artifact, Professor Hudgens, and even himself. As more and more evidence of a connection appears between his own past and that of Bureau 713, Carnby must decide whether to help save his friends  and possibly the entire human race  or abandon them to uncover the long-hidden truths for which he's been searching all of his life.

Now for the record, I have heard and read many stories about people walking out on bad movies but never actually witnessed it. Well, now I can saw I have. About half way into the flick, two people walked out of the theater that only had about ten people in it tops. And to be honest, it wasn't going to get any better. I have read so many, countless, reviews on this movie being God awful. I was really counting on this one to be good. I wanted to see it so bad, and I wanted to love it so much. But I can't.

The film is far from being the ""Worst movie ever made"" that so many people are making it out to be though. Bare in mind, the mad man that is responsible for the turd that House Of The Dead made this flick, you'll most likely get a rough idea of what not to expect. Uwe Boll seems to have improved his direction slightly with this one, and for the better. The movie is not completely mindless, as House Of The Dead obviously was. Tara Reid's performance was god awful, and thankfully, despite her having second bill, she does not over power the film.

Slater and Dorff have definitely seen better days. This movie is probably their worst as a matter of fact. I assume a few dead presidents had something to do Slater's and Dorff's involvement in this flop. I mean, the script isn't exactly Casablanca. But then again, but movie is? I have a feeling I'm going to be flagged with many negative comments because of this review. I do like this movie.

What I like about it is that the action is not constant, but rather it builds more on suspense and horror rather than blood and gore. Boll's direction is quite unique. It's become a little professional than his ladder House Of The Dead, which relied souly on mindless action. He seems to be able to make you jump on some scenes which he tried to do in House Of The Dead, but ultimately, he fell on his face with a ridiculous silly action flick that tries too hard to scare with action and gore rather than building up suspense. He succeeds with the suspense here.

Overall, Boll is bad director, and he just chooses bad projects. House Of The Dead was one of them. Alone In The Dark was also a bad choice, but he seems to have found to a way to approach this film differently than House Of The Dead (I can't put my finger on it, but it's there) and hopefully he gets better at it for his next films, BloodRayne, Far Cry etc. Which I am anxiously awaiting. I'm ready to see what Mr. Boll will have up his sleeve for his following films. Hopefully he WILL improve on BloodRayne.

My conclusion is simply this: Uwe Boll's career is soon to end in America, I'm not afraid to say. The man simply cannot direct. A blind mute has better direction than Boll's movies for crying out loud. But he does know how to entertain. And unfortunately, that is pretty much all Hollywood has to offer us right now, and Alone In The Dark succeeds on that level, yet fails on almost every other. I'm on the fence with this movie. I can easily say I enjoy it, but won't bother with it until the DVD arrives. If that. The ending is what really bummed me out. If you see it, you'll know what I mean.

668,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"I did not want to comment on this movie, but reading too much comments totally destroying it got me going! It is not (that) bad, in fact it is quite nice, with some tracing/tracing like detectives on a trail as well as firefights with demons end dragons with special ammo to be able to kill them. Christian Slater is not at all that bad in this movie, OK not top notch but it has not to be a Oscar candidate has it?

I liked it, in fact I bought an illegal copy which ended at 43 minutes, cause I liked it I bought another 2 weeks later(were told this one was good) to be able to see the movie until the end.

I gave it a 7(maybe it would be a 6- if there were not that much people giving it that much bad comment"
669,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Investigating a supernatural force, Edward Carnby finds himself on the toughest case of his career. With an archaeologist helping him to trace his findings back through time for centuries, the mystery only gets more complicated the further they delve into it.

So this is my very first Uwe Boll film and you know what? It isn't as bad as any of the other mediocre films out there. Maybe people just wanted to join the bandwagon? Well, getting that controversy out of the way, I found this film mediocre. The directing style looked incredibly amateur, which is surprising.

As for the story, I had no idea what was going on yet I was slightly entertained. It was much less boring than ""The Return"". The movie actually has some good special effects for the creatures and their design looked great. Although there are some clichés, this film managed to put TWO (yes, you read TWO) clichés to rest! Now the most recent movie that did that was ""P2"" and this was another one.

To find the two, I guess you'll have to watch the movie. Other than that, the performances were mediocre. Anything else to point out? Was this the worst movie ever? NO. Should you watch this movie to make sure? I don't know and I don't care. I just mildly enjoyed it with its cheesiness and fun."

673,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Consider this movie a patient in the ER with a gunshot wound to the head: It starts off flat line, and the next two hours of CPR are completely pointless.

The movie begins with scrolling text, and a horrible narration done by the guy who voices all those See-and-say Playskool toys. This goes on for about 3 minutes, explaining....nothing.

Christian Slater's character is introduced, as an investigator of Paranormal Activity, for an agency run by the government known as Bureau 713. Now, when you hear this, you'd think ""X-files"". No...actually, think more along the lines of ""Crossing guards who tried out for SWAT, and got rejected."" The organization is compiled of a bunch of scrawny soldiers in skateboarding helmets and paintball vests spouting tactical non-sense and waving hands in the air as if they're trying to give hand signals.

The story, from what I got, was this: This race of Hell demons came upon Earth, and a mad scientist tried to merge human subjects and the race together. He used 20 orphans as test subjects, and now, twenty years later, he has decided to continue his research.

Somewhere in there fits some crap about an ancient race that tried to contain the deamons....wow, to be honest, I just got totally lost...I'm sorry...and you will too, so don't even bother seeing this. (Recently, movie prices were just dropped in my area...so thankfully I only wasted $10.00 instead of $14.00)

From a technical standpoint: There is no plot..the characters are as dry as the turkey I ate for lunch...These ""elite soldiers"", as I said, run around in knee pads, skateboarding helmets, shooting at anything that moves, and even things that don't move..like the sky..or ground. There's one scene that shows closeups of guns firing in the dark for maybe five minutes...the producers didn't do it, but I will for you.

WARNING: THIS FILM MAY CAUSE SEIZURES. VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED.

The movie is just full of poor acting, and what didn't make any sense to me is this: These soldiers flip down their tinted visors...while in the dark...searching for a monster that is entirely black. Whoever wrote this script I am sure is on the street now begging for change.

678,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"ALONE IN THE DARK is sheer genius, an absolutely fantabulous amalgam of no less than six different monster-movie concepts, low-budget effects, Christian Slater and crap. German uber-hack Uwe Boll shrugs off any shame in the crafting of this cinematic clinker and delivers an instantaneous (and unintentional) camp classic.

Follow up to his 2003 zombie-lark HOUSE OF THE DEAD, Boll is back and proving fairly consistent, this being his second of two god-awful horror video game adaptations that provides more laughs than scares. In HOTD, Boll had almost zero budget, but made up for his technical limitations with a rotten script, lousy actors and a constant barrage of violence and sex. The genius of that film, however, lies in how boldly and unapologetically bad it is, and for the right audience, watching HOTD can be a great experience. ALONE IN THE DARK is much, much worse... and subsequently ten times more fun.

The ""x factor"" must lie in the amount of money those poor, witless European donors throw at Boll when he convinces them his movies will break even. This time the effects aren't bad, the action is polished, at least relative to HOUSE, and the actors are a lot better... known. Christian Slater delivers what should, God willing, be the defining performance of his dead career (either this or the Blockbuster exclusive PURSUED), bringing almost no weight or believability to his Ed Carnby, but a deliriously intense delivery on such lines as, ""No Hudgens! Don't be insane!"" Tara Reid can only be stared at for so long before you can almost see the dialog on the page as she drones on about whatever archaeological plot-furthering babble that her assistant museum curator (best joke in the whole movie) contributes. And Stephen Dorff is and always shall be very, very Stephen Dorff. The rest of the cast is filled out by one of the staples of a Boll film: random, untrained people off the street who bring a warm, campy quality to the backgrounds of each scene.

But the real star of this movie isn't the leads or the chatty extras; it isn't even the terribly familiar monsters (imagine H.R. Gieger's love child with a Velociraptor and Lon Chaney's makeup and you've got a very general idea of what they look like). No, ALONE's real star is Uwe Boll's direction. He masterfully guides this thinly-plotted tripe into utter oblivion and unavoidable audience confusion. In what could only have been born of a post-production, in the editing room, rough-cut's finished ""Oh crap!"" moment, the first three minutes of the film contains nothing but essential background information presented in a very engaging white text-scroll... and read aloud. It's kind of like STAR WARS... except not at all. You know you're in for a fun movie when the entire dose of antecedent information is dumped on you inside of the first three minutes (yes, it takes that long).

It's hard to tell where the visual aspect of the movie went wrong, as (only on a shot-by-shot basis) Uwe actually demonstrates some visual skill with the camera. However, once the shots get assembled together, AITD is a mess. The action scenes (especially a worthless fight between Slater and former-Sixers owner Pat Crocce) make BOURNE SUPREMACY look steady, the creature scenes are sloppy and lacking in continuity, and the shoot-outs are a bloody mess. Taking a page from EQUILLIBRIUM, Boll goes for the blinding-white-muzzle-flash-in-pitch-black aesthetic for one seemingly-endless sequence that actually gave me a headache. ALONE is a visual mess with only a handful of honestly good moments, and all of those are stolen from better pictures than this. I spotted ""homages"" to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, JURASSIC PARK, ALIEN and ALIENS, EVIL DEAD, the Watchowskis, Woo and Romero (for some reason there are zombies in this one, too). And each one is funnier than the last.

It should be noted that I haven't talked about the plot at all, which I've avoided doing thus far for several reasons. First of all, the plot is barely there as it is, and it provides enough solid belly-laughs that I wouldn't dare give away. Seconldy, I was laughing so much I honestly didn't catch much of the story, and what I did hear I barely understood. Thirdly, it's almost too ridiculous to summarize... but let me try. Christian Slater plays an orphan and once-agent of the secret government agency ""713,"" which is essential THE X-FILES with big guns... and in Canada. Slater, now in exile, tries to find pieces of his amnesiac past in an orphanage while simultaneously sleeping with Tara Reid, the aforementioned museum curator studying some fabricated Native American tribe of Satanic alchemists. Monsters. Guns. Crappy sex-scene. Hilarity.

Boll has recently said that HOUSE OF THE DEAD was intentionally bad, a self-deprecating satire of zombie movies. He wishes. The fact of the matter is, the man couldn't make a good movie if Orson Wells himself came back from the dead and mentored him for a decade or two. However, what he can do is deliver D-material horror schlock that will absolutely enthrall anyone with either booze or a very masochistic sense of humor.

679,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"I tell you what, i cannot believe the negative reviews this movie has managed to gather up on IMDb! my opinion, it's computer game fans just being picky! and disappointed because Vin diesel wasn't cast with Angelina Jolie or something, it shouldn't be in IMDBs bottom there's much worse like doom.

I took this film as a stand alone horror thriller flick, with a talented cast of Tara Reid and the very good Christian Slater, and they pulled it off well, some great effects with some equally as good action fighting sequences, they tried putting some new shooting scenes together, like they did in Equilibrium, which i think is a different & new look about action shoot em up movies! the only performance i found a bit dodgy was with Stephen Dorff, acting like a cardboard cut-out quite afew times! but many other actors have done the same, & wont be the last. but I've seen the same negative remarks about Resident Evil & Apocalypse, so if you enjoyed them try this! there's many other worse titles you could choose like The Grudge, Hellboy, or The Scorpion King."
680,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"The sound of IMDb users clambering onto the anti-Uwe Boll bandwagon is almost deafening. Alone In The Dark is leading most of the ""worst"" categories in this year's IMDb polls and three of Mr Boll's films (Alone In The Dark, BloodRayne and House Of The Dead) have been voted as being in the top 20 worst films of all time.

I'm not sure why Uwe has become IMDb's undisputed whipping boy. It might have something to do with the fact that Boll specialises in the generally reviled art of computer game adaptations or more simply, due to vote rigging by the bored computer geeks who largely populate IMDb. Regardless of the reason, ranking Alone In The Dark as the 20th worst film of all time is utterly ridiculous. The film is no worse than scores of other action/adventure films that hit the market each year and is, in my opinion, much better than some of the trash in IMDb's top 250 (Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith, Batman Begins and Toy Story 2 for starters).

A plethora of reviews have highlighted some of the film's weaker points. The plot is confused, the special effects are occasionally poor and Tara Reid is not exactly convincing as a brilliant archaeologist. I would respond that the plot, while far fetched, is never incoherent and is really beside the point in this kind of genre. The special effects are generally much better than those you would see in most American films with an equally low budget and the occasional dodgy CGI alien is rather endearing to genre enthusiasts. And as for Tara Reid, give the woman a break. She can't spend the rest of her days exposing her surgery scarred breasts at Hollywood parties in an intoxicated state. I think she gives a very respectable performance in a rather unforgiving role.

Now for the film's good points, which have been largely ignored. The film is technically very competent and Uwe Boll directs the film's action sequences with panache. I especially enjoyed some of the camera angles used to capture the firing of the UV bullets. As with all true auteurs, Uwe Boll's films have a distinctive style and that is particularly true of Alone In The Dark. The film's interesting look lies somewhere between film noir and a comic strip. This is used to great effect in the film's artistically filmed and unexpected conclusion. The performances of Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff display a lot of charisma and Tara Reid is captivating in her own way. As a fan of B grade and genre films, I also liked the odd CGI aliens and other dubious special effects.

Uwe Boll continues to forge ahead as a true cinematic pioneer, being the undisputed king of computer game adaptations. This pursuit appears to be much too low brow from IMDb users but I'm sure Uwe is having the last laugh, making entertaining films and watching the money roll in."

682,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"I thought that Christian Slater and Steven Dorff where fantastic in this film. I found the story different and the special effect were very good. Reading other comments about the film I feel people now expect far too much from movies. I recommend that you should watch this film as it has a lot of elements action, sci fiction. I would say it is one of the better Christian Slater films I have seen in awhile. I found this Uwe Boll film to be a big improvement on his previous film as I feel it had much better direction and story line. When you look at Christian Slater's career he really hasn't done enough action movies and I feel that he is very suited to that gen"
683,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"It would be easy to view this movie as simply another wretched entry in the recent spate of video game/horror movies. However, director Uwe Boll has brilliantly deconstructed this genre and cloaked it in the guise of Alone In The Dark.

The first 3/4 of the movie is devoted to setting up the conventions of the genre - invisible monsters, secret government organizations, the lone wolf investigator (brilliantly underplayed by Christian Slater), the implausibly attractive assistant (Tara Reid at her most self-aware). The setup, akin to Sondheim's Into The Woods, establishes conventions which the second part of the movie gleefully deconstructs. The last quarter of the movie turns all previous convention on its head, willfully ignoring its own rules and exposing the entire genre as the mindless pablum that it is - all while confusing the audience to such a degree that we are left with no alternative but to reject the overt meaning entirely and grasp at the underlying substance - which, as Boll masterfully renders, is nothing. He even taunts the audience with clues as to his actual intent - Reid's obviously intentional mispronunciations, climactic fights which end with non-exploding grenades, Stephen Dorff's entire performance. The simultaneous construction/deconstruction of the movie could be accomplished by no one save an artist on the level of Dali, which Boll undoubtedly is.

Ten out of ten."
684,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"This movie was not a complete crap fest. It had so so acting, but a decent story that evened the movie out. The Acting wasn't spectacular but it certainly wasn't as bad of some of Uwe Boll's movies. House of the dead was far by worse. The story was really good, it had me going until the last bit. The action scenes were great. They are very stylized and detailed. Sure it rips of ""The Matrix"" some what, but it does it very well.

The wardrobes in this movie, must have been picked from a four-year old, however. The Bureau 713 combat suits are obliviously paint ball armor. I mean come on. They're dealing with the PARANORMAL not the semi ad-normal. They should have metal or bullet proof vests on.

This movie also has enough plot twist that it can get confusing. How ever most of them are reveled within 30mins of the movie. So PAY ATTENTION! Other then that I really don't have that big of a problem with Alone in the Dark. It was decent for a Uwe Boll movie. Nothing more nothing Less. However if Uwe Boll truly put his full potential into this movie, instead of just thinking about getting this movie re-leased in theaters, it could have been a lot better.

However I just noticed a sequel is coming out, I don't see why. The ending left a loose end, but not a big one. It really dose not need a sequel. Well, neither did Blood Rayne. But now that's going on to it's 3rd movie. It really does bother me that Companies are trying so hard to get video game movie's out to the fan boys. Alone in the Dark had a lot more potential. Instead they wasted it on a cheap director, but hey. The movie COULD have been great but, Uwe Boll chose mediocre. Still, it wasn't that bad. You should at least give it a try."
685,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"In 1967, mine workers find the remnants of an ancient vanished civilization named Abkani that believe there are the worlds of light and darkness. When they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago, something evil slipped through before the gate was closed. Twenty-two years ago, the Government Paranormal Research Agency Bureau 713 was directed by Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), who performed experiments with orphan children. On the present days, one of these children is the paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), who has just gotten an Abkani artifact in South America, and is chased by a man with abilities. When an old friend of foster house disappears in the middle of the night, he discloses that demons are coming back to Earth. With the support of the anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) and the leader of the Bureau 713, Cmdr. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), and his squad, they battle against the evil creatures.

In spite of having a charismatic good cast, leaded by Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, ""Alone in the Dark"" never works and is a complete mess, without development of characters or plot. The reason may be explained by the ""brilliant"" interview of director Uwe Boll in the Extras of the DVD, where he says that ""videogames are the bestsellers of the younger generations that are not driven by books anymore"". Further, his target audience would be people aged between twelve and twenty-five years old. Sorry, but I find both assertions disrespectful with the younger generations. I have a daughter and a son, and I know many of their friends and they are not that type of stupid stereotype the director says. Further, IMDb provides excellent statistics to show that Mr. Uwe Boll is absolutely wrong. My vote is three.

Title (Brazil): ""Alone in the Dark  O Despertar do Mal"" (""Alone in the Dark  The Awakening of the Evil"")"
686,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"I saw this movie just to see how bad it really was. Director Uwe Boll is directing another movie that I was interested in called ""Bloodrayne, another video game based movie, and it's due later this year (2005). Obviously, after seeing the trash that is 'Alone in the Dark', I hold absolutely no hopes for any of his past or future pics.

I won't go into the plot, because, well, there really isn't any worth mentioning. Bad action scenes, a run-of-the-mill story, and ridiculous plot holes sprinkle the movie like the cheese that it is. However, I won't give this movie a vote of 1. There are other worse movies then this (I just can't remember any right now). The only saving grace of this movie is that there was an actual production value showing SOMEONE in the Special-FX dept was awake. The CGI wasn't too shabby, and the makeup dept did the job as well.

Remember Christian Slater? Remember him, WAY back in the day in Tarantino's True Romance? How about Interview with a Vampire? Murder in the First? He's a good actor, so what is he doing this for? There was an interesting read by Blair Erickson, who was assigned to write the original script for AITD, but walked out on Boll after doing rewrites. Erickson was so disappointed by Boll's constant harassing him of the script, that Erickson and the rest of the screenwriters walked out. After Boll hired other writers, he then phoned Erickson back, wanting to know if he could use some of his script ideas, WITHOUT PAY. Erickson seemed to have said no, for here is what he said:

""For those of you who actually give a s***, the original script took the ""Alone In the Dark"" premise and depicted it as if it was a actually based on a true story of a private investigator in the northeastern U.S. whose missing persons cases begin to uncover a disturbing paranormal secret. It was told through the eyes of a writer following Edward Carnby and his co-worker for a novel, and depicted them as real-life blue-collar folks who never expected to find hideous beings waiting for them in the dark. We tried to stick close to the H.P. Lovecraft style and the low-tech nature of the original game, always keeping the horror in the shadows so you never saw what was coming for them.""

To me, this sounds like a better script then what Boll used. Which proves to me that Boll is a bad director, and has no eye for a good movie, much less turning a decent script, or at least a decent IDEA of a script into a good movie. After 'House of the Dead', someone should really stop Boll from making movies based out of good video games, or ANY movie for that matter.

688,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"This movie could be considered torture. In the theater I couldn't help but think of A Clockwork Orange. Honestly I sat through ninety minutes of this crap fest before I walked out. (I never walked out on a movie in my life and I saw Jaws 4 in the theater) I can't believe that I waited that long. I just couldn't believe it. It was almost a quest to walk out of the film and have something to hold onto. Like, it was bad but at least the sound track was good. Nope. Nothing in that film was good. Acting? Bad! Story? Bad! Sound? Bad! Cinematography? Bad! Sound Track? Bad! Special Effects? Bad!

I'm discouraged that other people have actually given this film good ratings. They must be family and friends to the cast in crew. All I have to say the only merit this film has, is the idea that at least you can where it like a badge of courage that you managed to watch the whole thing.

I could comment on the story but what story. Can anybody tell me what it was about. I got the idea of the dimensions and Alien looking things and parasites. But the Zombies, the Mad Scientist. I knew I was in for a bad time when the prologue lasted for five minutes and was read by a guy with a lisp. So many things are wrong about this film but I can some up the problem with this. The movie refused to stick to the reality it set forth. I can believe in section 8 or creatures from another dimension. I can believe Tara Reid is a scientist. What I can't believe is that when the creature kill a security guard at the museum where she works and section 8 shows up and explains what is happening that Tara Reid would go back to work like nothing is happening.

So bad it goes to funny to bad again. Terrible!!!!"
689,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Most of us have played the games about a paranormal investigator called Edward Carnaby, this game gave Resident Evil (A.K.A Biohazard) most of it's features. The most famous of the games is probably Alone In The Dark: A New Nightmare.

But even if you haven't played the game the film is still as enjoyable and easily understood as it explains the set at the start.

The main two roles are nicely played by Tara Reid and Christian Slater. Aline Cedrac is an old flame of Carnaby's and in the games is a Professer specialising in ancient languages, in the film she is the assistant Curator for Pr Hudgens (Matthew Walker).

The script is gripping and eerie as Aline and Edward must fight the evil that wiped out the Abkani tribe.

The acting is very dramatic and it is though they are not them but the people they play!

what i didn't like was how the film was not based around Shadow island but an enjoyable film in any case!!"
690,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"In the early 90's Atari was Atari, and Resident Evil a twinkle in Capcom's collective psyche. Alone in the Dark, however, having been developed by then upcoming French publisher Inforgrames, was already doing the rounds, busy inventing the third person, variable camera genre that one day would give gamers stuff from the various Res Ev titles to more contemporary efforts like Silent Hill, Devil May Cry and Onimusha.

Therefore to see AITD's movie conversion owing so much to Resident Evil's big screen tenure struck one as deeply ironic. How did the tables turn so? It doesn't really matter, because at least for the first hour, director Uwe Boll's action flick kept its act together by providing solid, rollicking adventure fare with heaps more charm than the last RE entry ever mustered. The film displayed the same smooth execution we saw in Boll's 2004 video game interpretation, House of the Dead, and hopefully serves as harbinger of good news for his helming of another game-to-celluloid metamorphosis, coming attraction Far Cry.

Anyway, AITD the movie had very little to do with its game namesake, since none of the original series' Call of Cthulu Gothic charm made its way through, neither did the misty, almost Victorian locales cross over in the transition. Chief protagonist Edward Carnby has returned, done by Christian Slater in a much needed chance at coming back into Hollywood's limelight-infused embrace. Slater gave a respectable go at doing Carnby, although he decidedly lacked any serious one liners, thus depriving Alone in the Dark serious merit. The producers, to our joy, chose to stick with an R rating by not cutting out the gore and good language, somewhat negating the effects of dry, choppy dialogue segments bereft any memorable moments.

Other characters included archaeologist Aline (Tara Reid) and paranormal investigation Bureau 713 chief Burke Richards (Stephen Dorff). In the story, Carnby, himself employed as detective in all things unreal and spooky, just came back ""to town"" (Vancouver looking a bit too much like Raccoon City) bearing an ancient artifact from a long-lost civilization. Demented professor Hudgens (Matthew Walker) wanted the relic for his world domination scheme, of course, and since he and Carnby shared a sordid past, their paths soon crossed as a chase to get the item in question ensued, taking viewers to several locations. Bureau 713, led by Dorff, stepped in to save humanity from Hudgens' plans, and proceeded to engage armies of creatures known as Xenos in several quite impressive battle scenes as part of the overall plot progression.

AITD looked and felt like a B movie most of the time, adding to its charm, assuming you're forgivingly inclined. Sure, the CGI wasn't up to major release standards, but such minor niggles became easy to ignore amid the film's overall enjoyable content and surprisingly absorbing action. Speaking of which, one had to note a significant amount of attention to detail went into crafting these combat elements, with good set and costume design.

Towards the end things began to fall apart, sadly, and by minute 90 it had all reached a hasty and laughable conclusion, but even so, this one had that unique, shamelessly straight-to-video vibe, the one you perhaps remember longingly from defunct Dolf Lundgren releases and others featured on The Movie Channel's midweek late night schedule. Besides, it had a brief appearance by sultry Hong Kong vixen Francoise Yip (Black Mask), so who's complaining? Better suited to casual movie watchers than hardcore followers of the eponymous series, Alone in the Dark was a light-hearted mix of action and SF horror adequate for a quick caper fix and not too much beyond.

Rating: * * *"
691,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"This movie was beyond terrible! There is no saving grace to redeem it and create the feeling that you got at least some entertainment for your $7.50. The plot is superficial at best; the special effects are bad. The actors are flat, as if they checked their brains & emotions at the door in order to endure the pain of making this movie. The action sequences are trite, except for one lengthy epileptic scene remarkable only for its jerky cinematography that completely obscures any actual action that is occurring. It's as if the director (who, in my opinion, should be banned from ever setting foot on a movie set again) took elements from more entertaining action flicks, threw them into a blender until they lost all ability to entertain, and slapped them on screen.

There may be people out there who enjoy this film, but the entire audience I saw it with trashed it terribly. I strongly advise anyone not to go see this film but to beg Lions Gate not to allow this director (Uwe Boll --who also brought us House of the Dead) to continue with the video game franchise movies he has slated. It seems as if he licenses the franchises based solely on the success of the titles & throws the plot that actually made the games successful out the window. Do not be fooled if you enjoyed the game -- this bears no resemblance to it.

During one particularly lengthy Good Guys vs. Creatures shootout, I kept waiting for the equipment to flip over and show Tonka written on the vehicles and for someone to step out of the monster suit.

Truly a travesty that I don't feel ever should have been allowed onto the big screen. Save yourself & go play the game -- you'll have a lot more fun."

695,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Sorry kids, but I have to beat a dead horse. Herr Boll has made quite a name for himself. I guess someone has to step up and occupy the bottom most rung of the film ladder. This series of ridiculous, incoherent...stuff, as so many on here give testimony to, crowns him King of wasted film. There's no real point in discussing the movie, if that's what it is. Just because you see moving images when you press play doesn't mean it's a film. There's money here, you can tell, which makes it even worse. So many daring, imaginative filmmakers out there would love to have had this budget. But no, Boll is given yet another project to insult moviegoers. When Boll makes personal appearances he does get crowds, people just love to have their photo taken with him and get his autograph. I'm personally offended by this practice in that it only encourages him. Truly bad movie making should not be praised or encouraged. There are bad films out there that are fun, we appreciate the effort, especially if the filmmaker was sincere but fell short. But this is just another example of a man's insistence on his talent, confident in his abilities, arrogant in the face of audience reaction, time after time. I see in the trivia he blames the script. OK. This mess should come with a manual and some sort of medication. Boll is making Zombie Massacre due out in 2010. May God Have Mercy On Our Souls."

697,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Don't get me wrong. This film is pretty bad. But it's definitely underrated. I believe a lot of people genuinely hate this film. But I also believe a lot of people just go with the hype and give it a low rating because they hear everyone else hates it.

The film, as far as I understand, has nothing to do with the games whatsoever. Which may be why a lot of people hate it. I never played the games, so I wouldn't know. But as for the plot, people do exaggerate how confusing it is. Heck, I've never played any Alone in the Dark games, I watched the movie on my computer while chatting with my friends and I wasn't that confused. So it can't be that bad. Granted there are a few things that are never explained, and leave you feeling dissatisfied at the end.

The ""villain"". Old professor who injects himself with demon blood and wants to unleash a bunch of demons to take over the world. OK, for this type of film that's perfectly acceptable. But we never ever get to know why he wants to do this, what made him turn evil or why he's even necessary to the plot. In fact, his presence is actually just needed at the very, very end for one very brief sequence. So he's a totally useless villain that can't help but to confuse the audience.

Then there's some jumping in time and very unlikely happenings. For example, in one scene Christian Slater and Tara Reid is attacked by zombies in his house. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Stephen Dorff and his gang shows up. Alright, I can buy that. But why does he bring Slater and Reid along to the old abandoned goldmine? And couldn't they at least explained to the audience a little better that they were going to look for the old portal mentioned at the beginning? Also, why the heck does Tara Reid, who works at a museum, follow Slater, Dorff and a team of elite agents down into alien infected territory? The script isn't smart. Nor is the dialog. But the acting is alright. It's very uneven, with Slater and Dorff giving good performances, a bunch of other guys giving mediocre and a good chunk of the cast giving awful, but at least Slater and Dorff manages. Likewise, the music is very uneven. When it tries to be suspenseful, it suffers. But in action scenes, it's good.

Speaking of the action scenes, they are fairly nice. Very well shot and visually impressive. To bad there's to little variation. It's basically just a bunch of agents shooting aliens with their automatic rifles over and over again. Gets tiresome after awhile, despite the music and the nice visuals.

I wouldn't mind it if Uwe Boll made a straight out action film sometime. In fact, it might turn out quite good. But suspense and plot are not his strong points.

Overall, it's a pretty dull movie. It's not really that bad. Just dull. That's it's main problem."

Christian Slater, along with Tara Reid, and Stephen Dorff (who gets hardly any time in the movie) walk around shedding their clothes left and right and attempting to act in front of the camera in this wreck of 96 minutes of what a b-movie fanatic might just call a ""movie."" For everybody else, Alone in the Dark may be that one crapfest out there with enough bad editing, bad dialogue, bad direction, and bad acting to beat Plan 9 From Outer Space's record for worst movie of all time.

Dr. Uwe Boll finally proves to us that he is helpless, and even though God himself won't stop him from making movies, he is going to keep making clunkers till somebody shoots him in the head. The problem with him is that he has no taste in film; he thinks everything goes good with Matrix special effects. Someone should tell him that Matrix special effects belong in the Matrix movies, and not in horror video game adaptations. You will constantly see slow moving bullets and time slowing down as people jump through windows and swing punches during fight scenes. These effects cause a lot of money to film. Dr. Boll actually spent more money to lower the quality of his movie. Only he is capable of doing that. And on top of that, the overall creature effects looked like something out my Playstaion 1. The man intentionally made it to seem that way, and further lowered the quality of the movie, of what might of been a good movie if executed properly.

Brendan Fletcher, of Freddy vs. Jason fame, shows up in the movie and impresses the audience with his short but powerful performance as the surfing tax driver. Since when do surfers drive taxi cabs? In Alone in the Dark, they do.

I can go on about how bad this movie is, but I would be just repeating what the other two thousand negative reviews have been saying about this movie. You know, I'm a very optimistic guy. If one of my professors told me I only had a ten percent chance of passing the class, I would stick in there and hope for the best. As for Dr. Boll, I had the same optimism and for his other turkey, House of the Dead. Now this is no HotD review, but the movie was awful, and perhaps it was not his fault. Something could of gone wrong during filming, and maybe--just maybe--Dr. Boll isn't that bad. So I had some hopes for Alone in the Dark, but I now know since I have seen his latest film, I am positve: Dr. Uwe Boll cannot make a good movie if his life depended on it, and with the way his career is going now, I won't be surprised if something happens to him. Especially with all this anti-Boll messages popping all over the web.

705,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"If you could imagine taking an existing franchise, a somewhat successful one, say House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark, and then putting that franchise in a blender with all of the worst elements of every film ever made, set it on puree for 10 minutes, you would still have a better film than this one. Any attempt to list the inadequacies of this film, or of this director, would take me over the 1000 word limit of IMDb, as well as causing me to dwell on one of the worst films I have ever seen, in my opinion.

It is films like this one, as well as House of the Dead, that convince people that video games do not adapt will to film. I disagree and think that video games can provide an excellent framework for a good film. Even the best of books will not make good translations to film when the source is totally ignored. When a movie is so drastically different from the source it is based on, with only the title in common, then that ruins the experiences of those that enjoyed the game as well as for those that were looking forward to a decent return on their $7.50.

For myself, I would like my money back, please, Mr. Boll, as well as the 1.5 hours I just lost.

By the way, I'd like a new vote scale of 0 (should never have been made). At least with a film rated 1 (awful) there's usually a few good zingers that can be thrown at the film to make it enjoyable. This film does not even provide that."
706,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"You will invariably come across films where the only plausible response is, ""why?"". As in, why bother making it at all? You can rarely pin it on one person, and those who do are missing the bigger picture. Regardless, Alone In The Dark did not need to be made. This film should never have been released.

You watch it. Things happen, with only the most tenuous connection making a plot out of the story. This aspect of the film is so bad that, without the introductory dialog, there would be zero hope of the viewer understanding why these things were happening. So, the core of any successful film is, in my opinion, the story and the plot; there is a story here, but it's ridiculous. There is a plot, but it's too loose to do its job.

You watch it. You see Christian Slater overacting, stiff and lifeless. You see Brad Doriff, miscast and unnecessary. You see Tara Reid. And seeing Tara Reid is fine in my book, but when she starts talking, the magic is lost. You see bad acting everywhere, bad casting and ridiculous dialog, poor execution and performance all around.

You watch it. The actual fear from a horror movie is nonexistent; I challenge anyone to describe what truly scared them about this film. The entities that are meant to scare you are nearly void of purpose, poorly designed, digitally executed in a shoddy, video game-esque manner that detracts from the live action film you're watching, and, more than anything, are not scary in and of themselves.

Nothing about this film is scary. Nothing about this film is redeemable. For their budget, they could have filmed somebody playing the classic PC game it is ""based on"" (in quotes because, beyond the lead character's name, there is nothing in this movie that relates to that game) for two hours and made a more enjoyable film. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Another smudge on Uwe Boll's credibility, but not even close to being completely his fault."

709,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"I only give one star to one movie, and that is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Even the worst films I've seen I give two stars to, because they are at least not the worst films I've ever seen. Now if you were to ask me what my least favorite movie of all time was, I would say Wanted, but I can't deny that Wanted is a better movie than Alone in the Dark.

I have not seen any other Uwe Boll movies besides this, I guess I should consider myself lucky. This is simply a movie that does everything wrong. I haven't played the video game that this movie is based off of, so I can't say if it's a good adaptation, but the film is just so bad, that even if it was, it wouldn't help.

The writing is terrible, there are plot holes everywhere, it rips off a bunch of other movies, the characters are bland and forgettable, the dialog is bad, and it feels clustered. The acting isn't much better, I can't blame these actors, they didn't have much to work with. It almost seems like they know how bad the movie is.

And the direction is horrible. At points, I can't even tell what's going on, the editing is so annoying at times. The ending doesn't make any sense at all, and there are continuity errors everywhere. There is literally a scene where it was pitch black outside, and the five minutes later it's sunny, and I don't mean the sun is just rising, I mean it looks like ten in the morning.

The CGI is ranges from average to bad, and the worst part of the film, it's just really boring. I thought that at the very least the film would be so bad it's good, and there are a few chuckles to be had, but for the most part it's just a snore fest.

Alone in the Dark is the worst film I have seen thus far. It didn't tick me off as much as some other films, but it really is a terrible inconsistent film."

Despite a large budget, explosions, lots o' special effects and some well-known actors, this film is a total dog thanks to a writing staff of lemurs as well as a director who has all the grace and charm of Caligula with a migraine! The characters in this film have MORE swagger, bravado and spout more macho bull-crap dialog than you'd find in 10 bad action films combined! Seeing Christian Slater and the rest spitting out their lines with such ridiculousness really, really got on my nerves--especially since, like it or not, these folks AREN'T exactly the action hero types. Such swagger and manliness just seems very ill-placed and dumb. And, speaking of dumb...whose idea was it to feature Tara Reid as a brainy scientist?! I think Carrot Top or Barney the Dinosaur could have carried off a bit better! Some keys that this is a horrible film were the phrases ""based on a video game"" and ""Directed by Uwe Boll"".

711,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Dungeons and Dragorns 1 is far better than this! With a comment like this you know the movie is trash since D&D 1 is utter trash.

The scroll at the beginning reading out the back story to the whole audience. fine I would have preferred some film scenes but OK. Then the story builds up, not great but OK, the pointless fight scene at the beginning could have been left out but fair enough. then the night scene when the power goes out and the characters are left in the dark. that was good and was even mildly scary. but a film is only scary when the monster is left in the dark until the climax. Uwe must have got bored because very soon the monster is revealed upon us which would have been OK but then the guns are brought out and this where the film is sadly destroyed.

the acting gets worse, the dialogue becomes unbearable and the story is left to root. The story is OK in the beginning but very soon a bucket full of new back stories are thrown into the mix making the story even more confusing.

I didn't watch the whole film, my brain shutdown about 46 minuets in and it become painful to watch.

I tried to skip onwards to the existing part of the film but that was as like watching paint dry. when the climax is boring the film has been wasted.

I have never any of the alone in the dark games but i have heard that the early games were very scary and were more like thrillers rather than action games and that the games were better than this wreak of a film."

Not a gamer so not bothered about anything related to it. Christian Slater does a good Constantine impression whilst Tara Reid ........very bad actress. But the story is quick paces. Some good stunts. Pretty good effects for the time and some good gory moments also (the split head is awesome) So this is far from the worst film ever made. The one out of ten scores are just daft. It's really not that bad. Try watching the sequel to this and tell me it's better!? Ha ha. Nope. Now that IS a stinker.

Christian Slater plays very good and convincingly - one would really believe him that he's an expert for paranormal activities.

727,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Let me begin by saying that if you trust the other reviews here, you may also want to judge the latest Killswitch Engage CD by reading Blender and Rolling Stone. Much as the reviewers of those magazines are unfamiliar with, incompetent, and unqualified to review metal music, so too is the average reviewer here, mind corrupted by one too many J. Lo and Tom Hanks emo-fest, unable to write anything even remotely qualified about horror, fantasy, or monster movies. Throw some action into the mix and disaster beckons.

The movie was a nice blend of comic book styling, action/suspense, and big CGI monsters. If you like the Aviator, stay away from the movie (and by reciprocity, writing reviews of said movie). If you are looking for a simple, fun, action/monster movie based on a video game few remember, then go see it if there is nothing better you have been anticipating. The movie isn't great, but it isn't bad either. It is simply a decent, fun movie, for those whose expectations aren't misguided. The beginning was a little slow, the volume too loud at times, and the ending was great. The movie is Alone in the Dark, not Fried Green Tomatoes. Again, chicks and guys who dye their hair (Maxim readers anyone?)should avoid.

I can hardly wait to see the people who gave this movie low marks make a stab at reviewing the next Judas Priest or Slipknot CD."
728,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"I know, it's fashionable to hit on Boll right now. And he's clearly not a great director, so some of it is justified. However, while this movie isn't the next Reservoir Dogs or The Matrix, it's an enjoyable little action/horror flick with an intriguing story.

First of all, technically, this movie is quite well done. The computer effects aren't exceptional, but they're better than those in many recent Hollywood flicks. The creature design is pretty cool, too, even though some close-ups of the monsters are visibly computer generated.

Acting is generally sub-par, but not annoyingly so. I like Dorff and Slater, and they deliver their part. Some of the supporting cast is pretty bad, but they aren't on screen for too long.

The main weakness of the movie is the script. There are some plot holes, and the story is a bit complicated. But if you pay attention, read the intro and listen to the voice-overs, it's quite easy to follow what's happening. Large parts of the story seem to be taken from Lincoln/Child novels, which is just fine with me since I think more of their books should be turned into movies.

The film is about 50% horror and 50% action. While it couldn't stand as an action movie or as a horror flick, the combination of the two make it quite interesting. The action scenes are well filmed, with great music scores and some interesting camera perspectives. The horror scenes deliver the scares, and caught me off-guard four or five times.

All in all, this isn't a memorable movie, but it *is* a very enjoyable movie, clearly better than some of the recent Hollywood action/horror movies like Species 3 or Cat Woman. It absolutely does not deserve the low rating it currently has. If you like action/horror movies, rent this. Don't expect a movie in the level of Underworld or Blade, and you won't be disappointed."
729,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"From the director of House of the Dead? When I first saw AITD, I was unfamiliar to Uwe Boll, the director. I was interested in the film, so naturally I chose to see what people were saying about it on IMDb. I was shocked at what I read! First and for foremost: Uwe Boll has established himself; most people know of him. Why? Terrible movies? I don't think so.

Dr. Boll and his work have been bashed from every angle,and some unjustifiable and rude comments have been made. People seem to find themselves in the following of ""Boll Bashers"" whom can't stand his work.

Why? Is it because Dr. Boll doesn't give up? Because he makes movies that some don't like? I don't think so. I think it's a trend. See Boll, Bash Boll; no true justification. Lay off the terrible, direct insults.

Second: The Film ***may contain spoilers*** Alone in the Dark. I do believe that there was a miss-casting w/ characters and some things didn't seem to original (story), but I won't ignore the fact that it had some awesome shots and nice character models and creature effects.

The battles between the creatures were interesting, and cool, but I think what lost people was it's darkness. Yes, the film was dark; literally. Some shots, you couldn't make out what was happening. For instance: The final battle w/ the 713 soldiers and the creatures, there were some cool gore effects, but they were hard to see due to the lighting.

The cool thing about this movie is the actual look and feel. The film possessed a very 90's creature-feature feel... what's that? The 90's was full of creature films that used the a lot of CGI w/out puppeteers. AITD some what uses this idea because there was very few puppeteers in it. But it was cool, and I liked the creature's design.

Third: See it.

Watch the movie and form an unbiased opinion. I know most will not love it, but I can't see everyone hating it...

I own the DVD. I love it.

Why? The special features and commentary.

Ever watched one of those commentaries and all they talk about it ""yogurt"" or personal, stupid stuff? Well... Dr. Boll's is not like that! He actually talks about the film, the technical aspects, his feelings, and his true thoughts of the film business.

Fourth: Hate it or like it! Hate it or like it, is that what AITD is about? I am not going to sit here and explain the reasons why one would hate it, because truthfully, it has its downsides, but looking at the glass half full is better.

All in all: The film has entertaining moments and dull ones too. It's a quick ride... fun and interesting.

Watch it.... if you don't like it, move on.

BTW, I can't wait for Bloodrayne :) -JVL"
730,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"I don't view movies like ""Alone in the Dark"" because I'm looking for high art, gripping suspense or outstanding performances by cast or crew. It's nice when I experience it, but I really only want to be entertained. And it takes very little to at least entertain me.

This movie had less than that bare minimum standard to offer.

I imagine the performances were okay, but with such bland, cliché dialog how can you really judge? There was no suspense, the monsters didn't really have much to offer in the way of scares, and so much just doesn't make sense when you stand it up against common sense.

I felt my heart drop when the movie opened with so much back story scrolling up the screen that I immediately wished they'd made THAT into a movie. Even with so much information given at the beginning regarding certain aspects of the story, you don't really find out anything about the characters throughout the movie to make you feel like it would be bad idea if they were killed.

The entertaining story was the back story. What they put on the screen seemed more like epilogue.

My other theory is that they all showed up at the set without a script, decided to shoot some random scenes of cool looking paramilitary guys shooting CGI monsters and leave it to some guy in the editing room to make sense of it. Maybe some scrolling text at the beginning would say something about a plot and that would do it. The deal is, the producers had Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff at the hotel, the paramilitary costumes were ready, there was a little sun in Vancouver, the heavy metal soundtrack was ready and the CGI guys were already animating the monsters, so why waste time waiting for the writer to do a p"

737,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"I gave this movie a 5 out 10. You would probably ask why I would do that. I'm in no way a fan of Boll's other movies. But this movie was great to enjoy if you are looking for a movie where you can shut down your brains and just look at it. I saw House of the Dead and I hated it. It was one of the worst zombie movies ever made. Having played the game Alone in the Dark, I did enjoy this movie. Sure allot of things were wrong: the plot holes, the directing, etc... It is great to see Tara Reid do things that she wouldn't normally do. Most directors wouldn't cast Reid as a scientist, but here she does play one and you have to respect her decision to do such a thing. I mainly rented this movie for the idea that this movie was based upon a video game and I wanted to see how he did it. Another reason were Stephen Dorf, Tara Reid and Christian Slater. I like seeing them on screen, so I wasn't disappointed in their acting abilities. They did give the best of their abilities under the direction of a director who isn't a A-class director. This movie can be compared to Van Helsing, the Mummy Trilogy and many other movies who are nothing more than mere entertainment and should be viewed as such. They aren't a masterpiece. Alone in the Dark is a action-horror movie with the emphasis on action and not survival-horror like in the game. It is great to see that Uwe Boll does take on the challenge to direct movies, mainstream Hollywood wouldn't do. Or the fact that Boll is not afraid to deviate from the game storyline. Perhaps in the near future, someone in Hollywood might come up with the idea to remake those Uwe Boll's movies and possibly even do it better than he does. But for now, we will have to do with Boll making movies based upon games. It's a acquired taste, this man's movies. I do hope that the next movies will be more quality than quantity, but I fear it would be the opposite."
738,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"There should be a rule that states quite clearly that movies like Resident Evil are supposed to be made in the spirit of the game, not in the spirit of blowing up everything possible. RE was a survival horror game, and a damn effective one at that, yet Paul WS Anderson managed to make it like any other video game movie to come along. Alone in the Dark is essentially the same kind of a spirit as Resident Evil, so of course, there is the slight hope the director will manage to have some piece of a brain enough to make a horror movie and not an action movie. Instead, Alone in the Dark just proves that there is no longer hope for video games becoming movies.

The plot, despite the fact that it obviously isn't supposed to matter, is the largest of many problems with the movie. The movie starts with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important, as after a minute passes, the audience stops caring and just sits through the rest hitting the object closest to them. Then there's something about an orphanage, some artefacts, an ancient tribe, some bureaucracy and some demons, all of which get so jumbled together that the viewers really can't follow with what is going on. Characters move in and out of the plot like candy, some having huge build-ups for meaningless deaths. Basically, what I can understand is that some demons got released, and Edward Carnby (Slater) has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage which has failed on him. He finds an artefact involving the demons and brings it to an ex-girlfriend anthropologist (Reid), who of course he manages to have sex with right away for no good reason. Then, out of nowhere, all hell breaks loose, and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander (Dorff), who apparently has a mutual hatred for Carnby.

It's all ridiculous, and the reason I don't really understand it isn't just because it's complicated and jumbled, but it leaves no room for anyone to really care. Instead, I highly recommend that, if you must see this film, bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion.

The action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little, right? Too bad, this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made, with enough quick cuts to behead a coop of chickens. Considering that this is based on a horror game, not an action game, it is especially annoying.

The first action scene involving a man chasing Cranby from a taxi is among the worst I have ever had to witness, and the rest isn't all that great either. The demons look somewhat cool, though the fact that they turn into powder when killed takes away all that effect. Scenes involving lots of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera zooming and panning faster than the head of a crack addict. It's all the kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps children in bed at night.

The acting is what I like to call taking actors and making them do nothing. Slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie, though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on. The same is true of Dorff, who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent (something that has happened to him a lot). Reid is pretty much exactly what she should be, background sex appeal, as whenever she tries to act it is a disaster (as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning).

In all, this is the type of movie that worries me about future video game movies. If they keep ruining the spirit like this, it's only a matter of time before Samus Aran is killing Middle-Easterns with an AK-47 and Tommy Vercetti is fighting a squadron of aliens. Unlike Resident Evil, however, this one doesn't deserve a second chance, as I don't think anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie is. It's bland, uninteresting and unexciting. This is the movie equivalent of diarrhea; it's all thrown together, nothing really fits and, in the end, you're just glad it's over.

I know, he finances them all himself through some kind of bizarre German fund, but even so, his ability to keep making movies despite absolute, complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe.

It wouldn't be so bad except that video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy. I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark series of games. Even the latest one, the New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of game play. There was a good movie to be made out of Edward Carnby's adventures, but this is not it. Now Uwe Boll has gotten his hands on Bloodrayne and Hunter: the Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Doom? I can only imagine the swath that this guy is going to cut through game-to-movie adaptations if he's not stopped. Someone needs to take away his line of credit, or these video game publishers need to wise up and realize that when they make a bad movie out of a game that kills the franchise, no one is interested in that title any more.

Think about it, is House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark a viable game title anymore? No way. A new House of the Dead game comes out for X-Box and nobody's gonna care. The title is dead, and all because of Uwe Boll. So if any of you out there work for a game publisher, or know a game publisher, or have access to a game publisher... please warn them.

This movie itself is not even worth reviewing. I can't separate what I didn't like about this pile of dung from the rest of it. Literally, everything about it sucks. The writing, the acting, the music, the CG effects, the editing. I thought that if I waited until it came out on DVD and then rented it with low expectations, I wouldn't be disappointed. Boy, was I wrong. Never underestimate Uwe's ability to turn out a big, steaming pile of BOLL sh*t."

742,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"I remember reading all the horrible, horrible reviews for this film when it came out. I meant to go see how horrible it was but it was out of theaters in three weeks. The only other movie to manage that is Gigli.

When the movie came out on DVD, I bought it to see how awful it was. I couldn't think of the sheer horrible attention that this film was getting was possible. After seeing it, I can understand.

First off, let me say that this film is not without some cool shots. There's a nice shot at the beginning that shows a bullet being fired from inside the gun, which I thought was neat. And the way the monsters in this movie die is sort of cool to look at; but it gets old after the first time you see it.

Let me start with the worst thing in this movie: Tara Reid. If bad acting was a sin, then Hell would've chucked Tara Reid right out since she's so unbelievably awful in this movie it's unthinkable. And of all the roles, she plays a curator. Now if she played a dumb, empty- headed sex toy then maybe I might be able to forgive her for how she treats her character. Apparently, Uwe Boll didn't realize that, although he did seem to think that if she took off her shirt in the movie, people would see it. He just didn't realize that making her do that in the middle of the film at the absolute wrong moment just made the movie even more hilariously bad. And is that a Mexican song or something during the scene of dry humping? I couldn't tell.

Which brings me to my next complaint: Uwe Boll shows off some of the worst directing skills you'll ever see in a movie. I mean, I'd give House of the Dead an F (and I only do that for very few movies) but HotD would score at least a B compared to this screwed up piece of junk. The movie starts off with a very, very long narration that causes immediate confusion (and read by a horrible narrator) and from there, the cuts are really, really dumb. There's this one point where Slater and Reid are looking around a building that's been destroyed and the screen blackens out. When it comes back, Slater and Reid are shooting everywhere and suddenly, an entire army has joined them. Huh?

And someone did NOT bother checking the mistakes in this movie. At one point, a team breaks through glass, but the glass breaks before they touch it. Tara Reid's earrings switch colors in the middle of one scene and after Slater walks away from a dead comrade, you can see her begin to get up.

As for the story... I was really lost. Something about an old tribe releasing darkness and someone ""opens the path"" or something and all the evil monsters pop out. It's just an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes (the technology is so advanced here that no character ever needs to reload in this film) that get, quite simply, BORING.

I bought this movie hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was. I didn't laugh, but I still think it's stupid. Very, very, very stupid."
743,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"First the only points of interest I found with the entire film: the CGI shot when the camera went inside Christian Slater's gun as it fired off two bullets, and the Nightwish song over the credits.

Now the Bad: Ever talk a person who knows about something - say, Edgar Allen Poe's writing - but doesn't really know it? Ever meet a person who can imitate martial arts, but not actually fight with it? Or run into a guy who can go through the motions of an art form without truly understanding his medium? My personal favorite, ever run into IMDb users who've read dozens of reviews and (wrongly) assume they can write something useful?

Alone in the Dark is an exercise of uninformed imitation; it's a montage of images pulled from better films, linked together by incoherent thoughts that masquerades as a plot. It's as though Uwe Boll decided true originality was impossible, so instead he'd borrow elements from everything and call it style. Someone must have left off the first part of that Hitchcock quote, ""Self-plagerism is style."" Emphasis on ""Self"" Uwe, ""Self-plagerism."" Got that? Good.

From the opening TCM meets Star Wars text crawl (minus the John Williams fanfare) to the final Evil Dead shot, Alone in the Dark is one idea right after another that is done better in better movies. It doesn't bother me so much that ideas are taken from other materials, it's the fact that Boll takes someone else's ideas and ODs it on steroids. The shining example would be the shootout at Carnby's place, ripped from a scene in Equilibrium.

The unlit ""gunfight"" from Equilibrium worked because 1 - there wasn't much (if any) camera movement or cutting, 2 - it was very brief, 3 - the focus stayed on one character, and most importantly 4 - it was intended as an abstract view of a gunfight. Alone in the Dark attempts a similar scene, except to make it his own Uwe Boll moves the camera, cuts, quadruples the length, shows more characters/monsters, and tries to make it a valid gunfight within valid geography. The end result is incoherent chaos in the frame, chaos that the audience will not care enough to even try to follow. I can easily see people nodding off in the middle of the climactic scenes, sadly.

Which nicely brings me to my next point - I had no investment in this film on any level. I didn't feel anxiety when the monsters lurked in the unknown abyss of darkness, no sense of dread came over me when the monsters swarmed and severely outnumbered the good guys, I got up to get popcorn during the sex scene, and picked out a new ring-tone for my mobile phone during the final battle. As a side note, three weeks ago I watched my new DVD of Hitchcock's Psycho and was amazed at how excited I felt watching the opening credits - yes, you heard me right, the opening credits to a 45 year old movie that I've already seen . . . many times.

I'm baffled by the lack of suspense both Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead have. Apocalypse with all its hellish terrors can be upon the main characters, and the glowing digits on the DVD player counting down the rest of the running time has more suspense. Maybe it's the fact that Boll, instead of keeping his eyes on the road and steering this horror vehicle at its intended target, he's too busy looking over at Sam Raimi, Kurt Wimmer, Peter Jackson and not realizing he's about to rear end a cop.

Slater worked just fine, Dorff did all right, but I suspect they'll be picked on by critics since the rest of this film will put viewers in trash-all, leave no survivors, mood. Tara Reid, on the other hand, is fair game, because her performance is worthy of a possible Razzie nomination. She failed to convince me that she was associated with a museum in any way. She delivered her lines as though this was the first time in her life she said this many big words in the same sentence. I was not convinced she had any knowledge of, much less mastered, the vocabulary this character is supposed to use on a day-to-day basis.

Her delivery sounded like an actor struggling to recite lines without knowing what they actually mean. Ever listen to someone try to speak a language they barely know? There's a certain flat tone to listen for since the person is struggling over the vocabulary, giving them no room for expressionistic vocal inflections. Tara Reid plays these same notes while reciting the historical mumbo-jumbo that's supposed to make the plot make sense.

In the end, Alone in the Dark is a step up from House of the Dead; however, strangely enough, House of the Dead is the more entertaining of the two. An analogy - House of the Dead is the main attraction at the freak show who is so hideous that you have to see it to believe it. Alone in the Dark is just a really really ugly guy on the street."

748,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"I've seen some bad movies in the last year or so, but this one is more than just bad. It's a personal insult to the audience.What's even worse it's supposed to be based on two things I somehow hold dear: a) H.P. Lovecraft and b) Alone in the Dark video game series.

The movie was probably meant to be a rendition of a 4th game in the series (which was also a VERY bastardized version of the original trilogy). The first three games were set in 1920's and involved an middle-aged bespectacled private investigator Ed Carnby who gets involved in some paranormal phenomena. It was all very creepy and atmospheric. The 4th one involved a younger, cooler, kick-a** Ed Carnby who somehow got a serious weapon store at his disposal, brandishing even a laser gun (!). Blah.

And now we have a MOVIE version of the WORST part of the video game series. Do we have a case of garbage-in-garbage-out here, ladies and gentleman? Well, no. Uwe succeeded in making bad material infinitely worse. To the point where it makes ABSOLUTE NO SENSE AT ALL. The video game's plot is Shakespeare compared to this pile of crap.

I think the problem lies in the fact Uwe didn't quite get the grasp of English language. For him, ""horror"" means ""lots of SFX and loud soundtrack and explosions and bimbos working as museum curators"". I mean, Tara Reid? What was he thinking? Uwe also thinks that horror movies must include Matrix-like camera work, and basically look like a Britney Spears video. Cos that's like cool and fizzle-wizzle and the kids will dig it,yo.

I'd like to say that this is a movie for younger audience. However, I don't know how young exactly should you be to possibly enjoy this. This movie gives video games a bad name, gives Hollywood movies a bad name, and (what's actually good) makes ""Uwe Boll"" a bad name to have."

The man took a solid premise for a game: that being a private investigator inexorably drawn into supernatural, lovecraftian events, and voided his colon all over it.

We have three moderate celebrities: Slater, Reid, and Dorff. Slater is painfully wishing for his Kuffs days, trying to be the jaded wisecracker. Reid can't pronounce half the words that were churned out for her cliché of a character, and Dorff's only purpose in this movie is to miss his cues and scream obscenities.

There is -no- valid argument to defend this movie; neither comedy nor schlock nor camp factors. Uwe Boll is a disgrace to the very concept of storytelling, regardless of the language he's in.

762,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"A hundred thousand years or so when the moon doth glow there comes a film so horrendously bad it's fantastic. One of those cinematic experiences that forces you to simply laugh hysterically, rolling in the aisles at the utter farce and feeble attempts at film-making. From the music and editing to the directing and oh-so-stellar acting, the film becomes ingrained in your memory as one of those all-time ""so bad it's good"" films to cherish forever...

ALONE IN THE DARK is not one of those films.

Alone in the Dark is such a horrid film that the notions of character growth, suspense, or even plot don't even come into play. The film is utterly pointless, as the entire plot and all its secrets are divulged in the ""Romping Room Story Time"" at the beginning, where a laughably bored narrator reads a five-minute long short story with the passion of a Prozak junkie that makes Ben Stein seem like a Shakespearan thespian. The film might have well just taken the actual script and voice actors from the video game and just added beginning and end credits. There is no horror for the horror buffs. No suspense for the suspense buffs. No impressive special or visual effects that couldn't find on my XBox, and certainly no sex (just bluntly obvious dry humping with a bra-clad Tara Reid in a scene as sexually titilizing as watching a one-eyed, three-legged badger hump my refrigerator), and quality acting equal to...let's say, a car dealership commercial.

So, in short, this film is essentially a true testament (along with such winners as Racing Stripes) that Hollywood has officially ran out of ideas, and was so desperate to spend money that ALONE IN THE DARK was just ripe for the picking. However, there is a great upside of this magnificently atrocious film. It makes you dumber. Much dumber, and hopefully after enough marathon viewings of Racing Stripes and Alone in the Dark, Hollywood may achieve its ultimate goal of lowering our IQs and expectations to such an extent that this movie, and all other movies like 3 Fast 3 Furious surely due out next Summer, will seem good and entertaining and life-affirming. So keep on trying Hollywood. You're not there yet, but you're on the right track! A for effort."

765,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"""Alone in the Dark"" reviewed by The Correct Critic

""Alone in the Dark"" is an appropriate title for the first film I ever saw alone in a dark theatre. It's a good thing I saw this disaster alone, because if I had asked a friend along, I would have been dreadfully embarrassed. Most of the January-February movie fare is as tempting as my mother's cream cheese and jelly sandwiches. With the Oscar buzz high, studios feel the hype over the Best Picture nominations will drown out any talk of these duds. Hollywood may even make a few million dollars off these disgraces without drawing criticism that 90% of movies released in January or February are not worth two dollars, let alone nine or ten. That said, ""Alone in the Dark"" barely qualifies as one of these duds, because it is hardly a movie. The plot, if you insist. Well, there is no plot, but rather an incomprehensible premise based on an Atari video game. Christian Slater plays Edward Carnby, a paranormal investigator. An insult to the Warrens, Carnby is trying to solve a mystery. During Carnby's youth, he and eighteen other orphans were abducted from a home for a brief time. Carnby possesses little recollection of that fateful night. Tara Reid plays Carnby's girlfriend/ex-girlfriend, a museum archaeologist specializing in Abskani artifacts. Tara Reid as a scientists  yeah, that's believable. Attempting to show she is no longer the All-American Pie girl, Reid adds a rough edge to her voice, only to sound like she suffers from emphysema. Her acting suggests she is smoking something, and I am not talking about nicotine addiction. Thrown into the mix is a mad scientist, a team of paranormal investigators under the title 713, zombies, and half-invisible creatures. The filmmakers feel these elements tie together; the audience may not share their perspective. The director, Uwe Boll, is on the same level as Ed Wood, a man voted Worst Director of All-Time by a critical survey. But while Ed Wood and his monster movies were laughable (come on, the man was a transvestite), there is nothing funny about Uwe Boll. I was astounded to discover that this man, who has his characters spout the cliché lines ""It's happening again"" and ""Some door were never meant to be opened,"" actually has a Ph.D. in literature. ""Alone in the Dark"" is one of the two worst movies I have seen in my life. The other is a film adaptation of Antigone our English class viewed last year. That horror consisted of five spoken words, a nails-on-the-chalkboard score, and a bunch of females licking each other. You can always identify the worst movies, because they are literally painful to sit through. The obnoxious, ear-splitting noises (meant to scare) and the flashing of machine gun fire in ""Alone in the Dark"" gave me a headache. They should have cut the movie down to 30 seconds, and aired it during the Super Bowl as a live action Halo 2 commercial. Does ""Alone in the Dark"" have any redeeming qualities? Aside from instilling aspiring filmmakers with hope and confidence, NO. If I had the time, I would definitely stand outside my local cinema and picket this garbage. This is the movies at their absolute worst - the ""Citizen Kane"" of poor film-making folks. A sin against the art, ""Alone in the Dark"" will be damned to the ninth circle of Dante's inferno, where it will spend eternity frozen in black solitude."

Nothing was good about this movie. The story was forgettable (I seriously don't remember it), the acting was high school talent show-ish, and the script was a mistake. It had to have been a mistake. I can't find another way to explain how a script as bad as the one used for Alone in the Dark could have been written. And the action... Director - ""Lets play some rock music while the actors shoot guns in a dark room! Wooo! It'll look cool."" Not an exact quote, but I bet it comes close.

Alone in the Dark isn't ""so bad its good."" Its just so bad. It was so bad the filmmakers had to add a 200 word title scroll just to clarify their mess for the test audience who originally screened it.

First, the plot is choppy and leaves the viewer filling in logical holes. The acting is also choppy and has that cold, impersonal feeling you'd get if it was created by computers themselves. Further, the plot is unoriginal and boring. By the time the climax scene comes, you've long since given up on caring about the characters or the outcome.

We're used to seeing great characters and rich game environments being diluted in the translation, after all the genre and most attempts at it are continuously mocked, but this had NOTHING to do with the game. The clue is in the Title: ALONE in the DARK. The fevered anticipation the game arose in you is kin to Dallas crawling through the Nostromo air ducts, not some sub-par Starship Troopers style shootouts on a building site.

At no point did I care about the characters, they could all be wiped out and it would be of more interest to watch the CGI creatures go about their daily lives. The plot is non-existent, as if each actor is playing a role in a different film, turned up on the wrong set and went through their lines, not a shred of story is told.

In all this isn't a bad film, as we know, bad films can be quite entertaining, this is just a hollow pointless waste of 90 minutes or so. Some OK camera work saves it from a 1.

In addition - worst thing about this movie is that it probably killed the gaming franchise, and that's where the true horror of this movie lies."

Anyone who has done this will know what I mean. The only thing funnier than how horrible this movie actually is, is how amazing Uwe Boll thinks it is. Pay close attention to the sex scene, the commentary on that scene is comic gold. It's like the man lives in his own little world, in which there are no greater directors than himself. He truly lives up to his Ed Wood comparison. However, I would suggest watching this in the company of friends, to share the humor with.

775,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"i think perhaps my expectations were suitably lowered... i kept expecting it to be a lot worse than even the most ridiculous, steroids driven movies...

sure the cuts between scenes were amateurishly abrupt, tara reid is possibly the most miscast museum curator in history, the script is as fetid as old cheese, it's a bit dull for an action movie, and it hasn't really got any scares... but it's just standard fare... i can think of a few movies that are equally bad or worse (bad boys 2 springs to mind... and resident evil 2)...

uwe boll seems to have his own distinct style... it's a bad style, but you can see it coming like a neon pink volkswagen...

i kept wondering if Christian slater and stephen dorff were blackmailed into this movie, or had gambling debts (mind you, dorff was in feardotcom... infinitely worse than this)... Christian's comments in the ""making of the movie"" featurette made me sad...

the story is silly, but it's not really as hard to follow as some would have you believe... it is derivative and threadbare (but how many aren't in this genre?)... the creatures do look like bad lifts from many monster flicks of yore... in fact at times i had deja vu, like i was seeing the relic again (the marines dropping into the museum, etc etc)... but hey, some of those movies are only a few points better than this...

i think my biggest problem is that i can discern no connection to the games... unless the 4th game is a little different?... carnby has too many friends and helpers... the biggest sin is he is not truly alone in the dark...

although i sort of stood up for this, it really is a very bad film... it's reasonably short (probably the best thing about it) but it's not as boring as say, ghost of mars... rent this only if you're curious, or you really want to watch a guns and monsters movie that requires no mental participation on your part..."

781,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Edward Carnby, detective of the paranormal, unexplained and supernatural, investigates a mystery (the recent death of a friend) with clues leading to ""Shadow Island"" that brings him face to face with bizarre horrors that prove both psychologically disturbing and lethal, as he discovers that evil demons worshiped by an ancient culture called the Abskani are planning on coming back to life in the 21st century to once again take over the world... and only he and a young genius anthropologist with an incredible memory (and his ex-girlfriend), Aline Cedrac, stand in their way, at a gateway to hell. Standing in Carnby's way, however, is the impact that a brief encounter with an evil spirit called the Queen had upon his mind, as he slowly finds himself overpowered by the forces of darkness as they eat away at his very sanity...

Uwe Boll became known to the world with the video game horror based film House of the Dead. After the horrible reviews and box office, someone somewhere decided to let Uwe Boll destroy another video game franchise, this time it's another horror video game, Alone in the Dark. Which frankly is how you should watch the movie, if you have to that is.

Alone in the Dark goes wrong in so many directions, the first would have to be the screenplay, which has too many plot holes and confusing storyline that no one can tell what is going on. Throw into the mix a director that has no clue what he is doing except throwing an explosion here and a shootout there. Boll did one thing right, make the movie about soldiers shooting creatures, instead of your everyday party goers, such as seen in House.

Alone in the Dark suffers from a lot of different things, but even if you didn't know who Uwe Boll is or how bad the script actually is, you must be able to notices the horrible casting job. Who in their right mind would think of Tara Reid for a genius anthropologist? Her lines range from horribly delivered, to ""hey look over here"" or ""hey check this out"". Slater plays an Indiana Jones type character, who lacks the charm, wit, courage, intelligence...basically everything that makes Indiana Jones.

Stephen Dorff isn't that bad of an actor, he just has the unfortunate curse of choosing bad movie roles. Either he needs a new agent, or needs to get better material thrown his way. Frankly military leader hunting the beast who has conflict with the lead character doesn't do him justice.

A lot of the scenes are laughable when Boll tries to make them hip for the new generation. Such as the characters being in total darkness, then shooting the bullets that have lights on them which light up the characters and the screen. Boll should take some directing lessons and not try to make something look appealing.

It's obvious that Boll doesn't care about the story, or just doesn't understand it, the characters, the music, basically everything that makes a movie with the exception of special effects. Boll tries to make the film cool with it's ""slo-mo"" and of course the shot where the monster jumps at the screen.

Apparently someone out there thinks Boll is doing something right because he has numerous video game titles on the way, next up is Bloodrayne. I can only hope that when FarCry hits the theatres he will learn from his mistakes and make at least a decent film for once in his life."
782,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Alone In The Dark is one BAD movie and tied with Deuce Bigalow for worst movie of the year. I wish that was ALL I had to say but of course the IMDb stipulates a word count and all that.

I'm in two minds about what kind of bad movie is a worse kind of bad movie. A low budget dreck like Red Zone Cuba, Monster A Go Go and Manos. Or a huge budget disgrace like Gigli, Superbabies or this guff. You see movies like Monster A Go Go and Manos happen because the director hasn't a clue. Movies like this happen because the director is a stupid, money grabbing idiot who simply doesn't care about his audience.

It's more shocking when you consider that Uwe Boll (The mastermind behind this shocking crap and already has some real garbage under his belt) has created something that only happens once in a blue moon. The really terribly bad horror film. Everything about it is a mess. Cheesy CGI, bad plot, insane random camera cuts and appalling soundtrack.

Alone In The Dark is a dreadful movie that should be watched by absolutely nobody. Woo hoo! Review over. Give me a bud, roll on 2006 and may I NEVER speak of this again.

Don't watch this film."
783,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Alone in the Dark is Uwe Boll's kick in the nuts to Hollywood after House of the Dead's punch in the face.

If anything it proves just how much of a master manipulator Boll is. After forcing Artisan out of business over the flop that was House of the Dead, one can only assume the normally credible Lion's Gate Films only released AITD under contractual obligation after acquiring Artisan's assets. Because AITD is an even bigger example of complete lack of coherent film-making ability, plot exposition and just plain stealing poorly from other movies because it was supposed to look cool instead of because it fitted within the movie's framework.

But then that's the point, isn't it. Boll isn't trying to make a coherent film because he isn't trying to direct Alone in the Dark. He's just trying to manipulate Hollywood.

Alone in the Dark, like House of the Dead, Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, Bloodrayne and the other 3 or 4 projects that are ""announced"" or in ""pre-production"".

These aren't movies to be directed, but investment portfolios. Every single one of them rushed into production under the pretence that the tax law Boll and his investors are exploiting may be closed within the next 2 to 3 years. The more bomb projects he can release within that time-frame, the more money he and his investors can gain. Why bother making a good movie when a bad movie's making you a mint anyway? The result is movies like the awfulness of Alone in the Dark.

Alone in the Dark, like all his other movies are just a cynical exploitation of Hollywood's current trend for lazy film-making.

And to those who support Boll by calling him misunderstood or the next Ed Wood, congratulations, by making a cult figure out of the man, you're just making it easier for him to get investors but giving him notoriety.

For more information, read here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php?s=&threadid=21699 As an aside, just don't ask me how he's getting his cast-lists together.

784,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"*hits self in head* I was going to rent Shaun of the Dead over this piece pile, but something drew me towards this. Mostly because I like movies about weird things happening with aliens, FBI and the paranormal all in one. And Christian Slater, for some incomprehensible reason. Why? Why would he want to act in this? I really disagree with some posters here, despite his talent, really that dialog couldn't be saved.

People would be a little shaken up over the events in that film, and it really takes more work to establish characters who didn't. Being an aspiring fiction-writer, the storyline pained me. Heck it reminded me of something I'd write at two AM during a 'free write' just to get the stupid out.

I don't know. I liked the bit at the beginning with the rolling words, that kind of thing might've gotten a person slightly nervous. I just couldn't stop thinking of the old man, Fischer I believe his name was, that just rolled on into port with a bunch of dead bodies and blood strewn over the walls. How did that process go? Just so everyone knows, I didn't finish this. Turned it off when the surgeon guy (well the one that scanned Carnby with... something) was standing in his kitchen with his wife. Before that my attention had begun to deviate rapidly, so the details might not be a hundred percent."

786,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"In short: This one could have had potential, but it wasn't realized. I didn't play the game the movie is based on, thus I am not influenced by it, but I just assume it is a cool, atmospheric one. The movie is neither, nor.

The movie starts with a short sequence of a boy running from a group of soldiers. We are told that he fled from an orphanage. The nun that runs the building gave her group of 20 childes away to a government agency for demonic experiments (in the sense of the word). Quite patriotic of her, don't you think?

In an instant, it is some twenty years later. The boy is a treasure hunter now (or something like that, it is never really revealed) and has to flee again. This time the villains are after an artifact that he found, that can open the door to a dark dimension full of demons. So far with the story, there isn't actually much more to it, really.

The movie has all the clichés, that a mystery thriller cannot live without: beasts, experiments on humans, unmarked helicopters, liquid-filled ammo (seems to be a new trend), mad scientists, some geek handing out cool equipment and dark places of course.

The characters change their attitudes toward each other within the blink of an eye from rage to ... Now, what do you think? There MUST be a sex scene in every Hollywood-movie, right?

Christian Slater: The character of Christian Slater stays shallow all the while. Did he ever express grief, compassion, fear, doubt or terror? Maybe yes, had they only shown his face close-up now and then. Okay, he has some mildly amusing scenes, but that's it. That's not enough to get in touch with a character or feel with him. Sorry, Chris, I'm sure next time you will be in the movie that brings you back! Tara Reid: Plays an archaeologist. She really looks cool in that movie, giving it an interesting look, but not much more. Her acting is sufficient. Stephen Dorff: Poor guy! He ruled in Blade and in some other cool movies. What are you doing in this dark place? Still, Stephen is the one with the most vivid character.

The sidekicks are mostly cannon fodder with no given personalities. They just seem to fall and stumble through the badly written script, which does not offer possibilities for them to show that they are sophisticated human beings. If only they did it with some style, it would be easily excusable. Hint to the script writer: Just add a little tic or habit or attitude to them (adds a huge amount of life and makes us feel sorry for them, if they die).

The logic in this movie seems to be beyond my intellectual abilities. Or is there none? It seems to me they put the characters together by force. Not to speak of the story threads that they introduced but never finished. Sometimes I just sat in the theater and thought: 'What the hell is this scene for?' Sometimes it's even worse than just the usual ""What, there is a monster? I think we should split up!"" And I can stand A LOT if I am at least entertained well, which wasn't the case here.

The director does his job. He is not really gifted, but he can let a guy hold a camera. Wild, disturbing camera movements in the fight scenes are common nowadays, alright. So the action scenes are okay, sometimes even good, but did he ever work with actors before? Actors act and The Man makes sure, that the camera gets it. You should improve your abilities here. Just my opinion.

The editor must have been living in a very dark place, too. It seems he made a pact with the script writer to ruin the story of the movie. Sometimes, when the camera fixes on a person, you think: Now it's time for the actor to show what he's paid for. Half a second later there's a cut. Huh? Humor is there too, slick one-liners and so on, but nothing memorable at all.

The creature effects were quite nice in the way that the beasts flashed between visible and invisible. I liked that. The music was okay, but sometimes strained my endurance. A little more subtlety would have been better. Too bad poor Nightwish had to crown the end credits with their beautiful music. This movie ends as always nowadays, open to a sequel (hope there will be none).

Summary: Don't waste your precious money on that movie! Now and then I even expressed my discontent with the movie to my neighbor, which I NEVER did before in my life! At least I didn't leave the theater. Total Time Toilet. Therefore: 3 *

Watch in cinema? No Rent it? It you have nothing better to do in your life Buy it? Are you kidding?"

790,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Oh, Uwe Boll. Not only were you terrible with comedy, you don't seem to understand the basics of horror/action filmmaking either. Or dialogue. Or human interactions.

Alone in the Dark starts with an impossibly long text crawl that explains, in confusing detail, the world that the movie takes place in. The thing is, what's actually there isn't that far removed from what other movie that combine paranormal investigative teams, ancient cults, and otherworldly dangers. I was reminded of Hellboy, and while Hellboy isn't Guillermo del Toro's greatest work, it does cleanly establish the rules of its alternate version of reality that involves Rasputin, the Old Gods, a demon baby, a secret government organization, and a few Nazis trying to bring about the end of the world. Alone in the Dark tells a similar story but it's told in such a convoluted way that it's really hard to simply figure out what is going on.

There are flashbacks to the main character's childhood that seem to end with implications of a bunch of dead kids, but they're all alive twenty years later and have been turned into some kind of unkillable monster zombies. There's talk of a secret division of the government out for paranormal research and defense, but its history is really unclear until the very end when some of it gets cleared up (way too late to matter). The basic professional relationship between the professor who disappears and reappears at will and the secret division is muddled at best. This movie didn't have to be a great work of art to just arrange the information of how everything works together across, but it also wouldn't have taken that much effort. Maybe Boll was trying to be unpredictable, but he ended up just being confusing. Or, he's just an awful storyteller who has no idea what he's doing. There's always that.

To make the movie experience even worse, it's not populated with characters but human looking automatons that spout expository gibberish at each other. No one seems to have a discernable motivation to do anything. They do it because it is their type and they are in an action horror movie, so those types must be followed. Dialogue is stilted and unnatural and most of the actors are really just sleepwalking through the whole thing. The only exception is Stephen Dorff. Poor Stephen Dorff...he was almost Aragorn, you know. He gives his all in this ""film"" as the badass and hardnosed leader of a squad of secret government paranormal troopers. He throws tables and emotes, dammit, he emotes, but the character is threadbare and no one else around him cares.

The movie is also largely flatly lit. Everything set inside during the day looks like it was filmed for a cheap television show. There are no shadows and everything seems so two-dimensional. When the CG monsters attack, the lights go out and we get a bunch of darkness that's equally flat. The absolute low point of the film is probably the moment when there's a desperate attack on our ""heroes"" in the dark with guns blazing, and the music cranks up some kind of pulse pounding hard rock. It's so completely antithetical to the idea of how to build a sequence in an action/horror film that I laughed.

This film is shoddily made, confusingly assembled, boringly performed (save poor Stephen Dorff), and doesn't understand the basic building blocks of a horror sequence. Oh, Uwe Boll, my life would have been better had I not decided to try your ""movies"" out."
791,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,Warning: Spoi
792,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"As expected by another direction job by Uwe Boll, this movie is once again terrible. Boll really seems to have a talent for creating horrid films, and this is one that again does not disappoint.

While it is slightly better than House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark really does not have any redeeming factors whatsoever. There is a lengthy opening title sequence which, unlike something like Star Wars, is even narrated. I mean, does Uwe Boll seriously believe his viewers to be analphabetic? Does he think nobody that views his films can read? If the viewer's intelligence equals the intelligence of his films, perhaps that would be the case. It features characters that do not have any character development, no definining traits and no personality. Somehow Boll also manages to get an horrendous performance from every actor in his film. I get that most of the actors in his film are usually terrible, but Christian Slater, who is by no means a bad actor, is just absolute garbage in this movie. Boll has also done this to other critically acclaimed actors such as Michael Madsen, Ben Kingsley, Burt Reynolds & Ron Perlman. These are great actors, but somehow in films with Uwe Boll they are all just absolutely horrible, and seem to not have any motivation to be there. The same is true with Christian Slater in this one, as he wanders through the entire ordeal as if it is a struggle for him as an actor.

The acting as hinted to in my previous rant was once again terrible. Tara Reid is the most obvious example of this. This is an absolutely terrible actress further made ridiculous by the terrible writing this film has. She is this stereotypical sexy secretary who is, ofcourse, blonde. Let's not forget that she is also wearing glasses so that the stereotype becomes full circle. Apparently Slater's character is her boyfriend, although we never get to see why this is the case because both characters are soulless, cartoonish, monotonous 'people' that do not resemble any actual human beings whatsoever. The screenplay is as usual in a Uwe Boll production once again garbage. The most evident example of this is during the ridiculous conversation between a kid and Slater in the airplane. The kid states his mom says there is nothing to be afraid of in the dark, to which Slater answers: 'Your mother's wrong kid, being afraid of the dark is what keeps most of us alive', like it is common knowledge in this world that Abkani gateways open between darkness and light.

It also features narrative exposition. But do not expect something along the likes of The Shawshank Redemption or Goodfellas in this. The narration is absolutely atrocious. Literally everything that Slater narrates in this film consists of obvious facts that have been shown to us in great detail one scene or a couple of scenes earlier before. It is an insulting display of exposition, and it further makes me realize that Uwe Boll does indeed think that only idiots watch his films, because it is in the end ofcourse also an idiotic film itself.

Action sequences feature horrible editing and a lot of shakycam shots. There is never a clear overview of anything in any action sequence, but there is one scene in particular one has to point out. There is a scene when the Xeno's ( Yeah... this name is not an Alien ripoff by the way... definitely not. ) invade Slater's home and out of nowhere these paranormal investigators ( Who seem more like the SWAT instead of what they are supposed to be ) show up. What follows is a sequence that features an extreme amount of cuts, hilariously unfitting heavy metal music & an obvious lack of vision due to there being no lighting, Which brings me to my next point, the lighting of this film. This is a film with horrible lighting and terrible production values in general. There are so many shots in which the only thing visible is pure darkness. The one scene i just mentioned is the worst example of this, but there is literally nothing to see in this entire film. Everything is just complete and utter darkness. This cinematographer is on par with Uwe Boll's qualities. The CGI & visual effects look like cheap 1990 videogame garbage. Especially the one scene where a gate opens and loads of the Xeno's are visible. It just looks so bloated and ugly.

While there is much more to argue about substantially in Alone in the Dark, the bottom line i tried to summarize is that is has terrible acting, writing, lighting, CGI, special effects, narration & characters. The only positive thing i can say about it is that it is better than Uwe Boll's House of the Dead, but that's not saying much. It is still definitely one of the worst films ever made."

This starts as a standard horror movie, and no spoiler, this is the lines written before the movie starts; about ancient forgotten native Americans nobody remembers but they screwed up and opened a portal they FORGOT to close, to a dimension with horrible being wanting to take over earth. Good job there! But it's got Slater and Dorff in it, it could not be...that bad, right? AND - it's got lots of artefacts! Artefacts are cool, right? (20 Of them!!)

About 15-25 minutes in you realise this is just not a sub-par horror flick, it's a punishment, it's actual abuse of adult viewers. I mean, I'm putting my rep on the line here telling you I've seen this. Can I write a best seller about this at least...and get some money? ""I saw Alone in the dark - How I got back to life"".

He's meant to be one of the worst directors ever, but do you know what I think? I think he's a genius. No, I mean a complete wizard. I think he was trying to make a bad movie and wanted to create the dumbest, most sadistically awful trash in the history of cinema. Well, he certainly did that. But he must have been aiming for that! No sentient human being could produce something like this. I have encountered young kids with more directing talent. Alone in the Dark is awful in every sense. It can be funny, but not that funny. The acting, the writing, the direction, the plot... I could go on and on. It's a movie I don't really want to think about, since when watching it I felt like it was literally making me dumber. It was a genuinely unnerving experience seeing something like this had made it into cinemas at all. AITD is one of the worst films I've ever seen and to be honest, I don't want to talk about it. I still believe Uwe Boll is some sort of evil genius. As a result, I kind of respect him, since I refuse to believe a human mind, given a sizable crew, a generous budget and beloved source material, would be capable of something like this. I hope I'm right anyway.

795,Alone in the Dark (2005),2.4,Uwe Boll,"Alone in the Dark is one of the early films in Uwe Boll's career which went nationwide into theaters which has helped kill his career. This is considered one of his worst films and one of his worst reviewed films since it was one of his biggest. Based on a video game (having not played) I had no thoughts how decent an adaptation of the movie is to the game. With this movie, it is everything in which it has been criticized for. It is terrible, messy, confusing and hard to follow. Things do occur but it is confusing and a boring watch. The film takes itself too serious which hurts it.

It isn't one of those typical cheesy ""it's so bad it's good"" films that are bad films but still entertaining and unintentionally funny. Alone in the Dark is just bad and it isn't funny. For a decent sized budget film (having a $20 million budget), Alone in the Dark feels cheap and the story is very weak. There could have been at least some thrills, suspense or jump scenes but it was very bland, uninteresting and even the creatures looked unsatisfying.

But half an hour into the movie and it all went for a toss due to a very very weak script. The on screen appearances of the actors was good but it wasn't really backed by any actual acting.The dialogues were over cheesy and ludicrous in all aspects. Probably Priyanka Chopra was the only watchable element of the movie (or may be I am being biased).

Frankly an hour into the movie and i really felt like leaving (I don't know why i didn't). Trust me guys, its one of those movies which is meant to be forgotten and if you haven't watched it and are planning to, then forget the time and money that you are going to waste on this and just save yourself from the agony that might scar you.

The only way this movie could be watchable is with a group of friends who are making fun of everything possible whilst the movie plays."

You should not pay for this garbage and also should not waste your valuable time.

This film was not only pathetically terrible, but also a story line that made no sense. The usual sarcastic one liners fell flat.

803,Gunday (2014),2.4,Ali Abbas Zafar,"I would like to introduce myself as one of the Bangladeshi movie lovers. Probably Gunday is getting great response in India. But this film has started disaster in Bangladesh. Does the director understand that this project has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes done this film.

At the very beginning of your film,they are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think their script writer was plastered while writing the script. If their information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? India joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. India didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. Director can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us.

2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. they showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in their film. It's tremendously humiliating for us (All Bangladeshis).

3.According this story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous!"
804,Gunday (2014),2.4,Ali Abbas Zafar,"Its making money and thats the headline. Just a spoiled effort. Action and over-dramatic dialogues are its USP. Rest is just another Bollywood weekend movie.Bangladesh liberation war was modified as Indo-Pak war without giving proper exposure to facts. Bangladesh was born from the war between India and Pakistan ! Thats the terrible blunder. So any person who knows the facts will be disappointed. As we know from the previous review Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who declared the independence of Bangladesh in 26 March, 1971 and after that the war began between East and West Pakistan. East Pakistan later became Bangladesh, a sovereign state. Along with 90000 soldiers Pakistan army surrendered to the commander in chief of India and Bangladesh joint forces.The movie violated the sovereign feeling of Bangladeshi peoples. I'd rather prefer to watch ""The Busturd Child"" (2013) Hindi drama film directed by Mrityunjay Devvrat showing and emphasizing the real events that took place during 70'"
805,Gunday (2014),2.4,Ali Abbas Zafar,"Calcutta later Kolkata historically such a rich and old city was never known for only a bridge and gangster! It was the capital of the British India and known for many fine historical establishments; Fort William,Victoria Memorial,Howrah Bridge,Marble Palace, Dakesshar Temple are few examples of it! And if for great people of course for Tagore and Bose not some gangster!

And when it comes to the history of Bangladesh; Bangladeshis were fighting this war since the beginning of the year 1971 and India got involved in December 1971. In history it is written as Indian army fought along side the Bengali freedom fighters.

It is an utter nonsense and stupidity to portray such false impression of this great liberation war as an India-Pakistan war!

From this perspective I review this movie as a very poor script movie."
806,Gunday (2014),2.4,Ali Abbas Zafar,"The one area where Bollywood has achieved excellence and perfection is publicity / promotion. The art of pre release promotion has taught them how to sell their even average / substandard productions at good profits. The much awaited, hyped and promoted ""Gunday"" is finally out in the theaters and yet again, net result is ""Total Disappointment"". The movie from head to toe lacks attraction in any field (Story, Music, Direction & even Acting).The handsome combo of Ranvir and Kapoor proved insufficient. Irfan Khan selected a B Grade movie and disappointed his fans. PC is continuously on the way to destruction with another flop appearance. The charisma of YRF and embodied cast could not bring desired results. Although film may achieve a good business (May touch the magical Figure of 100 Crores Club)but it can not be termed a movie to watch. The idea of late 80s once again failed. It is a wake up call. I mean how long audience can be fooled by exaggerated promos and publicity. At last, it will fall. So Wake Up!!!"

Pakistan army killed 3 million people in Bangladesh. Of course then Indian govt. helped freedom fighters a lot and at the very end of the war, they sent their army to help freedom fighters on request of govt. of Bangladesh.

I strongly condemn this matter. It should be edited without any delay. Me & all the Bangladeshi people respect those Indians who sacrificed their lives in the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971 and we remember the contribution of Indian govt. at that time. But it doesn't change the history.

Bangladesh born in a long turmoil ending up a 9 month long war against Pakistan Army in 1971 but the liberation story starts far more from 1952 by language movement. India joined with their military forces in 3rd December 1971 and the Pakistan Army surrendered on 16th December 1971. Meanwhile India supported Bangladesh by restoring refugees, food, finance, arms and with many other things.

This is movie review page where I am opposing one specific content of the movie which is terribly hurting an entire nation. Yash Raj films still didn't respond in this matter where as Bangladeshi's are strongly opposing it specially the youth society.

Indian people have a lot of misconception about the history of Bangladesh. This is not very welcome, but this is understandable. Common people are not expected to have knowledge about the history of a foreign country. But when one of them is making a movie on that history. he simply can not do the same mistake. And from this well-known producer, this kind of negligence is never acceptable.

856,Gunday (2014),2.4,Ali Abbas Zafar,"In this movie they manipulate the history of our Muktijuddho. The Bangladesh Liberation War(Bengali:Muktijuddho) was a revolutionary independence war in South Asia during 1971 which witnessed the birth of the modern state of Bangladesh. The war pitted East Pakistan (later joined by India) against West Pakistan, and lasted over a duration of nine months. It witnessed large-scale atrocities, the exodus of 10 million refugees and the displacement of 30 million people. The war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the Pakistani Army launched a military operation called Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. Bengali politicians and army officers announced the declaration of Bangladesh's independence in response to Operation Searchlight. Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the Mukti Bahini (Bengali ""Liberation Army""), which engaged in guerrilla warfare against Pakistani forces. The Pakistan Army, in collusion with religious extremist militias (the Razakars, Al-Badr and Al- Shams), engaged in the systematic genocide and atrocities of Bengali civilians, particularly nationalists, intellectuals, youth and religious minorities. Neighbouring India provided economic, military and diplomatic support to Bengali nationalists, and the Bangladesh government-in-exile was set up in Calcutta. India entered the war on 3 December 1971, after Pakistan launched pre-emptive air strikes on northern India. Overwhelmed by two war fronts, Pakistani defences soon collapsed. On 16 December, the Allied Forces of Bangladesh and India defeated Pakistan in the east. The subsequent surrender resulted in the largest number of prisoners-of-war since World War II."

Bangladesh became independent because of the gallantry of the Bengali people consisting of men and women, young and old, soldiers and civilians. All together the Bengali people fought for 9 months against Pakistani army and made their motherland an independent sovereign country with the sacrifice of 3 million lives.

It is a historical, world wide recognised fact that Bangladesh is the only country in the world's history which is liberated by it's people for their freedom of language. This movie misrepresented the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. It is a disrespect towards Bangladesh and its people.

The movie director Ali Abbas Zafar, producer Yash Raj Films should have taken the correct history of the Bangladesh Liberation War 1971 into their consideration before attempting this movie. When a movie is made based on any historical event, sincerity, preciseness and correct context must be taken into consideration.

But on the subject of part 2, oh boy I was wrong. It depicted our Liberation War simply as a war between India and Pakistan. The script writers have cleverly re-written the entire history of the war and spat upon the memories of millions of people who were killed in dark chapter of our history. It also depicted a Bangladeshi Army Officer involved in Arms Smuggling to India and use children as sex slaves. This movie is a heresy and an insult to our country's history and our nation. I deeply condemn such deliberate misrepresentation of the history of Bangladesh and our people. The fact is, our struggle started from 1952.

It was our great leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who declared the independence of Bangladesh in 26 March, 1971 and after that the war began between East and West Pakistan.

To pass this of as a Third Pakistan vs India war is a total fabrication . Shame Shame Shame on YashRaj group.

Bollywood is notorious for being simplistic & one dimensional when it comes to historical references, but this movie really takes the proverbial cake. Perhaps they should learn from Hollywood film makers , who successfully stylise historical events in an entertainment vehicle.

The story writers of Gunday are historically ignorant (probably because they never went to school) and this movie is the proof of their insolence and ignorance. This movie insulted & sullied the image of Bangladesh in every possible way and it even fabricated a new degrading war history of Bangladesh.

In the beginning, the narrator says: Bangladesh is the result of an Indo-Pak war but the truth is: This war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the Pakistani Army launched a military operation called Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. Bengali politicians and army officers announced the declaration of Bangladesh's independence in response to Operation Searchlight. Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the Mukti Bahini (Liberation Army), which engaged in guerrilla warfare against Pakistani forces. The Pakistan Army, in collusion with religious extremist militias engaged in the systematic genocide and atrocities of Bengali civilians, particularly nationalists, intellectuals, youth and religious minorities. Neighbouring India provided economic, military and diplomatic support to Bengali nationalists, and the Bangladesh government-in-exile was set up in Calcutta.

India entered the war on 3 December 1971, after Pakistan launched pre-planned air strikes on northern India. Overwhelmed by two war fronts, Pakistani defences soon collapsed. On 16 December, the Allied Forces of Bangladesh and India defeated Pakistan in the east. The subsequent surrender resulted in the largest number of prisoners-of-war since World War II.

The Bangladeshis are very proud of their war history because they fought and earned their independence. Without any provocation, the Gunday Crew and Hash Raj Films have insulted the Bangladesh and It's people. Therefore, they owe the entire Bangladesh an apology."

You probably are getting great response for your new film Gunday in India. But this film has started disaster in Bangladesh. Do you understand that this project of yours has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes done in your film. 1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your velitation didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us. 2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us. 3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous! We consider the mistakes in your film to be unintended. Therefore apologize to us and correct the mistakes. Or else we will have to take different action. Thank you."

The maker and director of the movie should have done a homework on the history of the birth of Bangladesh before making this movie. Those engaged in making this movie do not have in-depth knowledge in history. Before making any movie based on historical events, a study on history is a must. Unfortunately, no one related to making of the movie has done that. Above all, if you watch this movie, you will be provided with some false pieces of information.

The war pitted East Pakistan (later joined by India) against West Pakistan, and lasted over a duration of NINE months. It witnessed large-scale atrocities, the exodus of 10 million refugees and the displacement of 30 million people.

The war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the Pakistani Army launched a military operation called Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. Bengali politicians and army officers announced the declaration of Bangladesh's independence in response to Operation Searchlight. Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the Mukti Bahini . which engaged in guerrilla warfare against Pakistani forces.

Do you understand that this project of yours has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes done in your film.

1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your velitation didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us.

2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us.

But, if you don't respect others history then how could you be so sure that people will not protest it. I don't frequently watch the Bollywood movies, but when i heard that ""Gunday"" movie is made of our liberation war perspectives then i was so enthusiastic to watch it. The first line of the movie is ""16th December 1971, the second highest surrender between India-Pakistan war after second world war and emerge new nation Bangladesh""..what the hell is this line?? They clearly mentioned that it was a India-Pakistan war and after that war creates Bangladesh. Let me say, how many people of Indian army were killed in that war compare to Bangladeshi civil people.

But the songs of this movie has always been one of my favorites - kunto maula, gunday title track. ITs when I started reading the reviews I really understand where these low ratings are coming from. Its rated 1 start by mostly those Bangladeshis who do not agree with the story of the movie. I understand they may not relate to the story but then if one was to rate the movie on its story I would rate it 8/10 and acting will fetch 7.5/10 but the climax of the movie is what really made me cry. Through out the movie I was slowly drawn into the close bonds the two lead characters share on the screen. It makes you cry at the end. Then climax is full 'paisa vasool' worth the money. It have seen the climax at least 10 - 15 times. Its when the movie ends you make sense out of the story, background narration by the two gundays makes it worth a worth second time. Don't go by the 1/10 rating these Bangladeshis have given because it shows how much Bangladeshis would like to be a part of this nation called Indian out of which they were born. 1 start rating is not due to bad story or bad acting but because it deeply hurts a Bangladeshis ego / sentiments. I have always considered Bangladeshis as brothers but then after all during 1947 they (as a part of Pakistan) had decided to part from India on the basis of religion - such stupids are difficult to find anywhere in the world."

The Pakistan Army, in collusion with religious extremist militias (the Razakars, Al-Badr and Al-Shams), engaged in the systematic genocide and atrocities of Bengali civilians, particularly nationalists, intellectuals, youth and religious minorities. Neighboring India provided economic, military and diplomatic support to Bengali nationalists, and the Bangladesh government-in-exile was set up in Calcutta.

India entered the war on 3 December 1971, after Pakistan launched preemptive air strikes on northern India. Overwhelmed by two war fronts, Pakistani defenses soon collapsed. On 16 December, the Allied Forces of Bangladesh and India defeated Pakistan in the east. The subsequent surrender resulted in the largest number of prisoners-of-war since World War II.

964,Gunday (2014),2.4,Ali Abbas Zafar,"...than watch this seemingly absurd, sheepishly long flick having 3 main characters and 1 special appearance where the latter does a more meaningful part than the main actors.

First of all, I still can't understand why Irrfan Khan's appearance has to be quoted as a ""cameo"" when he shares at least 20 minutes of screen space. Secondly, what were the writers thinking while authoring the twist in this film? The twist is so feeble, a 10 year old sitting beside me guessed it right.

Starting off with a childhood story about two friends who later become partners in crime, Gunday tells the story of how a woman can wreck havoc in friendship. But, after making this point, the plot fidgets. The twist actually smears the whole thingy with glittering banality. Love breaks friendship! Okay! That's cool! But why did you have to bring up a twist and re-frame the whole goddamn thing? That love did not break friendship. Why?

Arjun Kapoor's last stint in Aurangzeb was appreciable and it was one of the best movies of 2013. But, he overstates himself here, maybe due to the competition with ever charming Ranveer Singh. The latter does a better performance and has a better character, so to speak. Priyanka Chopra is a cabaret dancer, yet she tries to instill good values in other characters and request to stop the indecent act. Lame!

Irrfan Khan is the only appreciable person, but his dialog delivery is poor. Maybe, it all has to do something with the extremely unprofessional direction. The cinematography is fine, but why so many slow-motion shots? Music is fine, but 6 songs aren't too much?

At the end, what was a relieving climax also is turned into another long, slow-motion scene which culminates to dramedy. Every single factor of the movie is unoriginal, not to mention how during almost all the dialog delivery, the poor direction shows up like a spinach leaf on your teeth after dinner. Many scenes involves discontinuity wherein we expect the scene to end with a short conclusion, but in we are shown a new sequence. This was particularly terrible.

BOTTOM LINE: Last week's Hasee Toh Phasee told a better story. Gunday, due to its bad story, direction, screenplay & editing is just 3.4 out of 10. Even the two child actors couldn't entertain me. I chuckled maybe 3 or 4 times. But, the question is: is that enough?"

972,Gunday (2014),2.4,Ali Abbas Zafar,"""Gunday"" follows a familiar territory of best friends turning foes for their common love. What follows is an action packed story of petty thieves turning into the city's biggest outlaws and a cop relentlessly following the criminal duo. Such stories used to be favorite among the '70s film makers. Story-wise, the film isn't more than an average '70s action film full of improbabilities. You can't just digest Ranvir Singh and Arjun Kapoor as the most notorious bandits of Calcutta in the 80s as the film projects nor the police action against them looks much realistic. Overall, ""Gunday"" is weak in its story with unlovable characters and tastelessness. Performance wise too, the film falls short for the under performed roles of Irfan Khan and Priyanka Chopra. If the film grips a little, it's for the fast pace and the technical aspects of the film.

They grew up to become the messiah for Calcutta people but their friendship is torn apart when they fall in love with a common girl. Directed by Ali Abbas Zafar who gave us light hearted Mere Brother Ki Dulhan, Gunday is an action potboiler of 70's era where grand entry and punching dialogues by hero were welcomed with whistling and screaming in the theater. Zafar does fairly good job in keeping the audience alive but suffers from lackuster screenplay in the first half. The film boast off some high voltage drama but half baked romantic track spoils the mood. The second half picks up and will keep your attention till well executed climax. Few twist do add dome spice to the film. Art direction is ma gnus. Cinematography is outstanding. Songs are good.

975,Gunday (2014),2.4,Ali Abbas Zafar,"Watched ""GUNDAY"" –

I heard somewhere that this movie is a tribute to Legendary Friendship movies of Bollywood like ""Sholay"", ""Kala pathhar"". Along with Multistar cast, Yash raj Banner, Heavy Promotions and not but least the director Ali Abbas Zafar (Who previously directed MERE BROTHER KI DULHAN) make ""Gunday"" a sure watch movie to me.

The movie starts with a very promising note. It took you in the year 1971 when a new country was born named ""Bangladesh"" and also born a new group of people called ""refugee"". It also gave birth to two young orphans - Bikram (Ranveer Singh) and Bala (Arjun Kapoor).They faced war, struggled for food, saved themselves from a pedophile and ultimately managed to escape to Calcutta and here the story starts. During the struggle for their existence they understand that there is no straight path written for them and starting from stealing 20 kg of coal, the two friends grow up as the Biggest Mafia of Calcutta controlling the illegal trade of coal, timber and fish. This part of the movie is so high paced that it will automatically tighten your seat belt for the upcoming ones. As the movie goes on Nandita (Priyanka Chopra), the most beautiful mysterious (?)Cabaret dancer, walked into their lives. They both fell head over heels in love with her. Now Enters ACP Satyajeet Sarkar (Irrfan Khan), to counter force for Bikram and Bala. Besides, a hardcore and no-nonsense but still having a good sense of humor cop Satyajeet(Irrfan) is aware of the fact that 'United we stand, divided we fall' and is extremely happy to see that the Bikram and Bala have forgotten the ages-old maxim . But ACP doesn't know that they both are two bodies, one soul. After lots n lots of twists and revelations, the Gunday of this story, i.e., Bikram and Bala reach their inescapable destination.

""Gunday"" is a tribute to the Amitabh Bachchan style cinema of the seventies when the movies contained a proper story, good songs, superbbb dialoguebaji, attitudes, when the movies were action-packed and anger-packed terming the system as the villain which directed the innocent individuals on the wrong path. This movie is old wine in new bottle but this old wine renders a highly enjoyable kick to the consumer, i.e., the viewer. Action along with the Dialogue of the two heroes(in childhood as well as in the adulthood) is the best part of this movie. The first half proves damn engaging for the spectator. The story dips somewhat to some extent in the post-interval session but, the script-writer and the director brought it back on track and ended it with a high-octane climax in a coal-mine at Dhanbaad and the movie does not leave any sense of dissatisfaction in the viewer when they came out from hall saying ""pyaasa usul bhai"" or ""total masala yaar"" or ""superhit hai bhai"".

Regarding acting it's a challenge to overcome each other in such a Multistar cast(Ranveer, Arjun, Priyanka and Irrfan) movie where every one is a very good actor .But without any doubt I want to say that Ranveer Singh steals the show completely from frame to frame. Priyanka Chopra is just like a sizzler in the menu card. If you are a boy (whether single or engaged or married or father of 2children),you cant close your eyes for a moment and cant time to look other co-actors in the song sequences where Priyanka is performing.

On a whole a complete action packed masala movie you just loved to watch. As Friendship , Love, Betrayals(!) are on the air now on this valentines week this movie would surely be in your wish list.

6. Shitty dialogues.

7. Bad casting.

8. Horrible camera work.

The timeline of 1971 war between Bangladesh and Pakistan (Which was later changed as Indo-Pak war 1971) was full of lie and manipulation. Bangladesh was never born from the war between India and Pakistan, 1971. It was a long history and clash between Bangladesh and Pakistan since 1952 Language revolution. Later India joined the war (3 December, 1971) and helped the Freedom Fighters' of Bangladesh. As a Bangladeshi, I am not denying the fact that India helped us a lot that time, but its my right to protest against the proper manipulation of a country's birth history! It was our great leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who declared the independence of Bangladesh in 26 March, 1971 and after that the war began between East and West Pakistan. East Pakistan later became Bangladesh, a sovereign state. Along with 90000 soldiers Pakistan army surrendered to the commander in chief of India and Bangladesh joint forces. The instrument letter of surrender clears the fact. Anyone can search in internet and even in wikipedia for the truth : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War"

The Bangladesh Liberation War was a revolutionary independence war in South Asia during 1971 which witnessed the birth of the modern state of Bangladesh. The war pitted East Pakistan (later joined by India) against West Pakistan, and lasted over a duration of NINE months. It witnessed large-scale atrocities, the exodus of 10 million refugees and the displacement of 30 million people.

The war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the Pakistani Army launched a military operation called Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. Bengali politicians and army officers announced the declaration of Bangladesh's independence in response to Operation Searchlight. Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the Mukti Bahini . which engaged in guerrilla warfare against Pakistani forces.

That would obviously be a distorted history.

Now, come to the movie Gunday, written and directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, an Indian director, who's educational qualification is quite dusky as it is described (!) in his Wikipedia profile.

In these days of WiFi even in an impassable Africa region, the writer of the movie doesn't know the real history, on what he has worked.

Interestingly, there was no one in the movie team who knows the real history.

Priyanka Chopra, one of the major cast of the movie and who has been educated in the USA as far I know and who has worked with the like of Pitbull, doesn't have the instinct to refuse a movie which distorts history.

Over 100-year-old India's film industry now facilitating an uneducated, ignorant director like Ali Abbas Zafar, that should be a great shame for them.

Now, come to CBFC (Central Board of Film Certification), which certified the movie to be viewed to people across all over India who are not really uneducated or ignorant, which they should have known.

My question is, why are all the 26 chairpersons of the board assigned for.

The release of the movie clearly reveals that either they don't know the real history or they have no respect towards the history of how a nation fought to uphold their existence.

As they say, garbage-in, garbage out. Start with an L Ron Hubbard novel (your first mistake) featuring a completely plagiarized dark-skinned, war-like and hairy alien culture with wrinkly foreheads (if this sounds like Klingons to you, I thought so too!), and add unfortunate Barry ""can't get a break"" (or maybe it should be 'cant pick a script') Pepper and all you need is Travolta himself - playing the arrogant, merciless, slightly effeminate and quite under-sized leader of the alien colonists. Remove any hint of character development from the script and use the worst of the worst black box technobabble explanations for plot devices. Finally, stay true to the idiotic gibberish you based the film on in the first place, and you've got the makings of a rolling-on-the-floor comedy.

In fact, opening night, in a packed theater, people started laughing out loud about 20 minutes into the film and never really stopped. We had a great time that night. Halfway through the film more than half the crowd was actually interacting with the film, asking ""Mr Worf, where's Commander Riker?"" and asking troublesome questions about how many hundreds of years gas would remain viable in the gas-tank of a Harrier.

If you need to know about the plot - it's this simple - Earth has been conquered by an amazingly stupid group of Klingon-like aliens, and the remaining humans live in a large domed slave labor camp where they are taught that their sole purpose is servitude because they are stupid, weak, etc. Barry Pepper somehow becomes convinced that he's not born to be a slave, and learns to fly a harrier, etc. It's really not worth the effort of typing.

None of the reviews have done BE justice. Having heard what a start to finish mess this was, my brother and I decided to watch it, just for fun. It was horrible beyond all our expectations - and not in a fun way. And so I can now tell anyone who's interested: You must see this movie yourself to realize the sheer magnitude of its badness, stupidity, and ineptitude.

I've heard that BE cost about 70 million dollars to make - though how anyone could have greenlighted it is a great mystery. Since there was nothing on screen to indicate why it had cost that much, my brother and I have also worked out how the budget was allocated:

* Travolta's salary, plus assorted managers and hangers on: 40 million.

* Special effects, film, sets, costumes, makeup and hair extensions: 25 million.

* all other salaries: $4,999,888.

* script: $112 and change.

Though that still doesn't begin to explain the end result. I give up. I'll never understand how Travolta managed to get BE made, or released, for that matter. Why is he tanking his career again? Who knows? After this, why should anyone care? Ah, well. I hope he finds something better to act in in the future; I honestly can't see how he could come up with something worse.

The next question I found myself asking is this, ""How long would certain things (books, computer-dependent machinery, combustion engines) last and still be of any use to anyone?"" Too many things you see in the movie are simply beyond belief. But this is science fiction you say? Of course. The point is that the basic story could have been told without any of these ridiculous questions bugging the viewer if the people making it had just thought things out for an hour or two. I understand that suspension of belief is a requirement of sci-fi fans but you have to limit it to just what is necessary to tell the story you are trying to tell."

If you want to teach someone about plot holes, pop Battlefield Earth into your DVD player. If you can find a copy; not too people have wanted to rent this movie, so copies of it are rare.

This movie is painful to watch. It hurts my eyes because everything is so tinted, it hurts my neck because everything is so angled, and it hurts my ears because the acting is so bad. Oh, and trying to figure out why someone thought this would make a good movie gave me a headache. All that being said, I cannot hate this film like some other movies, and I think it's because no one thinks it's good. I feel like it didn't do anything to me. I didn't see it in theatres and I didn't rent it, it just soaked up a couple hours of TV time. And, I have to admit, it was a lot of fun watching how gut-wrenchingly awful this movie could get.

And it got awful. People have called Plan 9 from Outer Space the worst movie of all time. I disagree. I firmly believe that Battlefield Earth is the worst movie of all time. It had a budget, so it had no excuse to be awful. This is the worst movie ever made. It's painful to watch, it makes no sense, and watching John Travolta, Barry Pepper, and Forest Whitaker act in this movie was like watching Goofy.

My candidate for worst film for the new millennium: atrociously awful Travolta vehicle (who is totally to blame for his co-producing this pet project due to his Scientology ties) in bringing L. Ron Hubbard's cult sci-fi novel to fruition is just one God-forsaken mess from start to finish in what feels like the ultimate Ed Wood film with a dire need for the gang from MST3K to show up and provide apt ridicule: Travolta stars as 9 foot tall alien Terl, a Psychlo who commands his rampaging race in wiping out mankind in the year 3000 with only rebel Pepper out to thwart his nefarious plans of mining gold for his own just rewards. Ridiculous from the get go: the make-up of the Psychlos: a combination of dreadlocks a la Jar Jar Binks to the 'Coneheads' to the costume rejects of any speed metal band of the 1990s; the dim lighting and production design; the cheezy special effects (except for the climax of Terl's planet - who the HELL cares if I'm giving away the ending?!! IT SUCKS!!!) - which looked kinda cool!) and laugh-out loud dialogue: ('Rat-brains' is the often reviled retort by Terl to the 'man-animals' he despises). Travolta better get his mind straight because his post-'Pulp Fiction' comeback is running on jet vapors at this point and don't even get me started on his evil Vincent Price-inspired chortle!

1013,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"Lemme get this straight: This is a post-apocalyptic film that takes place a thousand years after an alien race conquers Earth. Well, I noticed a few plot holes in this film.

-- After 1,000 years, there is apparently no linguistic drift whatsoever. Johnny Tyler can pick up a book published in the year 2001 and read it just fine. Let's see, the King James Bible was written only a few hundred years ago and is nearly unintelligible due to linguistic drift.

-- Books don't have thousand-year shelf lives. If you go to the Smithsonian, you'll find the curators go to extreme measures to protect documents that are only 200 years old.

-- Are we really supposed to believe that stone-age barbarians can learn to fly fighter jets in just one week? It takes professional pilots years of training.

-- Jet fuel does not remain stable for a thousand years. Most of the plastic components in the jest would have become brittle. The battery packs in the jets would have become unusable. The tires would have gone flat and the rubber would have disintegrated.

-- I seriously doubt that our planet actually has enough elemental Gold that a high-tech invading civilization would still be mining it after 1,000 years. They probably would have packed up long ago."

1015,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"This movie should have been a 'Project Redlight'. John Travolta is out of his head and hopelessly devoted to L. Ron Hubbard. That he was able to con 10 other people into investing $80 million towards the making of this movie is the only real impressive angle I can work for this review. Perhaps Travolta wanted to work with Tarrantino again and thought the only way that that could happen is if his own career fell into the tank? Or perhaps he felt it was his duty to make the film in order to get a better seat in 'Dianetics Heaven'? Let's hope that Tom Cruise can learn from Barbarino's mistake.

I don't think it will matter too much to point out everything that is bad about this film, but the acting, the dialog, the special effects, the plausibility of the cave people's quick learning development, and of course, the hair extensions will just have to suffice.

I would have given the movie a 1 out 10 rating, but I did laugh at the movie quite a few times and that should be worth something, I think. The version I watched was on the USA network and it was modified for teevee, so I may have missed some key plot elements that were cut from the original vision of its director, but then again I may have seen some really good Levitra adds in its place. The end credits whizzed by so quickly that it would appear that no one really wanted to have anything to do with this movie except Travolta.

The rest of the movie is the standard very bad, short on budget Si-fi that can't interest any viewer with an IQ above sea level at all. The horrible thing is that the director hasn't even tried to convince you as the main character suddenly learns geometry (ok) and teaches it to his barbarian mates (huh?) who immediately appreciate the essence of it all (they ate raw meat as they have just learned what fire is). But then suddenly the standard IQ of these people goes sky-high: They understand atom bombs, know how to fly a Mig and work with highly cryptic computer interfaces.

So many of the shots were on an angle, I felt I had to keep turning my head, I was getting dizzy! Even the costumes were lousy. They looked like something you would see from a school play, forget this "
1020,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"I originally wrote a review about this movie after only seeing parts of it. Since I figured that this was unfair and nobody should review a movie without watching it entirely, I forced myself to watch it. Oh boy. First, a summary of my old first review:

Battlefield Earth was on TV together with another movie that I wanted to watch. The description for both movies looked interesting, but after zapping regularly between the two, it seemed that BE was just horrible. Every time I switched back from the other movie, it was as if nothing had happened. All the scenes looked the same, the action scenes were bad, the dialogue was horrible, and for some reason the movie almost made me feel nauseous. It was like having those typical nightmares I often have when I have a fever, where everything repeats endlessly. So, eventually I stopped switching channels and watched the other movie.

Now, after having seen it in its entirety, I'm feeling relieved that the rating I originally gave was fully deserved. I rarely give a minimum score, but BE is a perfect example of rare awfulness: it gets a solid one.

The whole thing is just directed and produced horribly. Let me put this straight: the story on itself is preposterous — I'll come back to this later on. Yet, even a stupid story can make a thrilling movie, but Battlefield Earth is not an example of this. The action scenes are all awful: it's often impossible to see what happens. The film is full of slow-motion shots, but they are used at all the wrong moments. One would expect that close-ups and slow-motion would be used to focus on the action, but not here: the camera often seems to shy away from the actual action. Judging from the poor special effects that can sometimes be seen when the camera does show some action, they probably just avoided using SFX altogether. The pacing is also completely off: scenes just drag along, and are then followed by a pile-up of action. Some transitions are so abrupt that it seems like large parts were left on the cutting table, but even those parts that survived are all poorly directed. Most of the film is tinted in an exaggerated blue hue, which makes all those scenes look like the same scene all over again. The entire movie feels like an episode of a bad sci-fi TV show from around 1990, stretched to almost two hours.

Funny enough, I found a perfect explanation as to why Battlefield Earth made me nauseous the first time I watched it. There is almost NO scene in the ENTIRE movie where the camera is NOT tilted. Really, what were they thinking? It may look cool when used now and then, but it's just ridiculous if *every* shot is tilted at a random angle. Sometimes subsequent shot changes will make the image tilt from left to right and vice versa, so it is entirely possible that watching this film will induce seasickness. This is not the only thing about the camera-work that is awful: there is an overuse of close-ups, and often half of an actor's face is cut off (partially due to the tilting). Sometimes we also get close-ups of random objects as if they are of great significance, but they aren't.

The acting is bad, not abysmally bad but bad enough not to be able to compensate for the rest of the awfulness. Travolta does a decent job but fails to drag this film out of the abyss.

The special effects probably looked OK back in 2000, except for the 'blaster' shots which would only have managed to awe an audience in 1980. But even the other effects look very dated now, it's hard to believe that movies like The Matrix are even older than Battlefield Earth. There is an obvious reference to the 'falling through glass' scene from Blade Runner at the start of the movie, but it is filmed so poorly that it was more like an insult to BR than a homage.

Now, by far the worst thing about this movie is its plot. It's not just full of gaping holes, even with all the holes patched it still is an insult to viewers. Battlefield Earth is rated PG-13 but ironically enough, the only people who might appreciate it would be at most twelve years old because they might still be able to muster enough suspension of disbelief. The first two thirds of the film are not entirely ridiculous, and could have been saved by an awesome ending. However, the actual ending was ten times worse than the most preposterous thing I have ever seen in any other movie. Even the ""nuking the fridge"" scene from Indiana Jones 4 seemed plausible in comparison. Even though I rate Battlefield Earth a 1, meaning ""never ever watch this"", I would still recommend watching it if you want to see amazing stupidness. Mind that the rest of the movie will make you hurl, but if you enjoy laughing at ridiculousness that wants to take itself seriously, it could be worth it.

The only thing that is remotely OK is the musical score, but only when considered on its own. Some scenes where nothing of much importance happens are accompanied by music that would be appropriate during a frantic fighting scene. By the time the actual fighting begins, the music fails to add any tension no matter how thrilling it is.

Overall, Battlefield Earth is a complete failure, and it deserves to be in the Bottom 100."
1021,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"What a bad film this is. I thought the critics were exaggerating when they said how bad it was but they weren`t BATTLEFIELD EARTH is one of the worst films released by a major Hollywood studio. It`s badly directed , badly cast ( Barry Pepper as Jonnie makes for one of the least impressive screen hero`s ever seen . Maybe Travolta should have stuck to his guns and played Jonnie . He perhaps would have been slightly too old for the part but at least he does have some charisma unlike Pepper) and has one of the worst scripts ever written. An alien race called Psychlos , sounds just like psychos , I bet they `re really evil and cruel . Oh they are evil and cruel just like psychos . Why do they think rats are the favourite food of humans when it`s the only thing they`ve seen humans eat ? And why do they think "" Rat brains "" is an insult to humans ? especially when they consider the "" man animals "" to be a primitive species . And am I alone in finding the term "" Man animals "" irritating ? Surely it should be "" Manimals "" ? A far sharper and clever expression . But sharp and clever is no way to describe this script . Cities stand almost intact after a thousand years since the collapse of human civilisation ! Not only that but so do large amounts of firearms , ammo and Harrier jump jets , and a flight simulator for the jump jets where the humans learn to fly within a week , and no doubt they`ll learn what petrol is and learn to put it in the jets in order to fly them . Does this sound very likely to you ? Let me put it this way: Go into a time machine and go back to the biblical times , capture a few dozen people , bring them back to the present and get them to become fighter pilots within the week. Do you think they`d be any good flying planes and shooting down enemy forces ? Me neither . Do you think they could overthrow a superior civilisation ? Me neither ? Do you think anyone involved with this film deserves to work again ? Me neither"

1027,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"It is the year 3000. Many years have passed since the world was conquered by an evil race called the Psychlos in order that they would strip it of its resources just as they had countless other planets. Man has been forced back to the Stone Age, slowly dying out in small, ineffective pockets of resistance around the world. Sent out from his community, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler stumbles across two other survivors who tell him of a place of the gods  a place that turns out to be a former city. While resting overnight the group is come across by the Psychlos and both Jonnie and Carlo are captured. A plot by one of the Psychlos to outsmart his bosses (who have deserted him on earth by turning down his bid for a transfer) opens the door for Jonnie to learn a great deal about his new masters and gradually he becomes the last real hope for mankind.

Being a film critic must be a hard job to do at times. Many of the films you watch will not be brilliant, nor will they be terrible  most will be OK and nothing more. Therefore when reviewers get a chance to gush, they generally take it. Likewise, when a bad film does come to the big screen and reviewers get to see it, they often will take great pleasure in putting the boot it  we see it with at least one big budget film each year (2004 was Catwoman). So I usually will try and view a really panned film because I am aware that sometimes the critics are just being unfair  however, most of the time I'll wait until it comes to TV to make that decision. With Battlefield Earth, I must concede that it is a pretty bad film  but maybe not as bad as the many critics all said, although it would be easy to just keep kicking it in the same way as everyone else does.

The film does have some very basic ideas that offer potential but these are squandered with a script that bulks out with bad dialogue, poor story development and an overall poor delivery that makes it a film that is certainly a mess, if not 'the worst film of all time'. The story quickly goes wrong by making massive plot jumps with its two threads (Jonnie and Terl) that it quickly becomes tiresome. It is not just that major parts of it make little sense (even if you are trying to get into it) it is also that the film makes it harder for itself by taking itself so seriously. If the film had been exciting and entertaining then I could have forgiven these jumps but the way it holds itself in such high regard means we have to meet it on its own terms  something that I found nigh on impossible to do with this. Whenever we are asked to accept that planes would have survived intact over 1000 years, or that anyone could learn to fly them in a matter of days then it is really asking too much if it also expects me to take it 100% seriously at the same time.

The film has clearly had money spent on it, and it isn't that the effects look bad, it is more that they feel over-designed. The Psychlos (cr*p name) look like nobody knew when to stop adding bits and they do look a bit absurd  like a Klingon but with more bits! Similarly the transport craft and alien sets all feel like somebody has just ripped off other films and then tried to combine them; the end result is the look of a cheap sci-fi that looks like it is a sci-fi film as opposed to a 'real' futuristic world. It is hard to describe and maybe I'm doing it badly but to me the film looked like the alien future's of a thousand sci-fi movies, not an alien future that exists outside of late night TV and, as such, it was even less engaging. Of course it didn't help that the direction was so ham fisted that Christian should be asked to return his Oscar out of good will. The opening action scene is delivered in a terrible slow motion that sucked all the potential out of it  a technique that is sadly used for most of the action scenes. The stuff with the harriers near the end is so silly that even a good director couldn't have saved it; but Christian is not a good director here and he makes it worse and robs it of any excitement or pace it may have had.

With such a poor product to sell to us, even an all star cast would have struggled  so imagine the trouble that one fading star and a collection of minor support actors have with it. Travolta tries hard but he can find nothing of value. He looks terrible and his performance is just soobvious and easy  there is nothing to watch here, partly due to him but also to the wider failings of the film. Pepper was a very strange choice for such a big role and, try as he might, he cannot get past the absurdity of the whole thing and he comes across as part of the silliness, taking his character way too seriously for the material  but I suppose he was only matching the mood of the film. Whitaker has nothing to do and even an appearance from the likable, low-rent baddie Kim Coates brought nothing to the film. I don't even know the rest of the cast by name but suffice to say that none of them can do anything worth seeing.

Overall this is a very poor film and, although I don't wish to join the mob by just kicking it, I didn't find any reason not to. The direction is awful but is at its worst in the action scenes. The effects are not awful, they just feel like generic, overdone sci-fi fare with little or no imagination  a big surprise when you consider that the director was nominated for an Oscar for Alien and won one for Star Wars for the very discipline of art direction! The script is clunky and the story full of moments that are, at best, illogical and, at worst, silly, stupid and laughable. The end result is a product that is a real mess with almost nothing of value in it. It is relentlessly shoddy and I almost wish the 'worst film ever' hype would drop off just so that this film could slowly fade from our memory and be lost in time."
1028,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"When I orginally watched this film I was unaware of the Dianetic / Scientology background that surrounded this film and pretty much saw it from an neutral standpoint. The fact that after I had watched it I felt disgusted and frankly scared that a film like this could be made in the first place made me dig a little deeper into the films background.

After doing a bit of research I came to the scary conclusion that apparently this piece of cr*p that is this film is actually taken seriously by Scientologists, not unlike Christians with regard to the Bible.

Yes, ladies and gentleman, people actually believe this happened - the awful storyline, the 2D characters and the ludicrous mindbendingly stupid conclusion is taken as the word of god.

So now I feel terrified that this 'cult' has the influence to finance and convince Hollywood to waste so much money. I do have to say the Hollywood does produce some god awful flicks, but none so highly publicised or with such big names starring in them.

So avoid this like the plague, don't give distributors any excuse to produce anymore copies of this rubbish and don't waste another second of your life actually watching it.

I give it -10/10"
1029,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"Well, it seems to me that everybody involved in making of this movie experimented with their careers. If I was the one financing it I wouldn't be sitting here writing sarcastic comments, I'd be after some heads. Roger Christian's especially and that of the screenwriter and possibly Travolta's.

Surely there have been other films that bombed colossally while being terribly expensive, but I haven't seen any that seemed to have been made to fail on purpose. Until this one.

Let's start with the obvious. Direction. Directing was so poor and intrusive even the most unaware of the viewers must have noticed it and realized for the first time in their lives how the watching experience can be influenced by bad directorial choices. One single choice stands out like turd in a punchbowl - tilting the camera in every single shot. Every single shot you watch with nauseating feeling desperately wishing that the camera straightens up. But it never happens. And there was never any artistic justification for it. Okay, we see the future world through skewed eyes because the future world is screwed - point taken - now can we watch the bloody movie? No.

I did endure watching it though, on a TV station that mercifully airs commercials every 15 minutes, so I could take breaks from time to time. I was able to realize that not only the picture has been massacred but the story as well.

I was hoping it wouldn't be due to the following: Hubbard, author of the story, was founder of Scientology / Travolta is one of his zealous followers / this movie is Travolta's passion child / Travolta took a key role in production as well. One would assume Travolta would honor his master enough to make this faithful to the book. Well, he didn't. And it's a pity because I found the book to be spectacular (I was in high-school, but nevertheless). It may not be original but it is quite an inspirational saga of liberation of Human race and Earth from Psychlos, a corrupt occupational forces from outer space. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't rate Scientology one bit (I think it's a daft pastime for rich and famous) and I don't rate Hubbard as a person (frankly, he's an idiot). And I also didn't give a hoot about allegorical messages of this sci-fi while I was reading it, nor did it prompt me to turn to Scientology. But, for all its flaws, ""Battlefield Earth"" is still something that might have put the whole ""Star Wars"" n-logy to shame. Had they done it right.

Of course, the movie is a fast medium, one must cut a lot from book to make it work on screen. But Travolta's vanity is also to blame for this movie's undoing. I guess if he was any younger he would be taking the role of Jonnie. Because the book IS about Jonnie, the hero (although opening parts of the book are written from the chief villain's perspective). It is about his journey from slave to master and mankind's journey to rediscover what they have lost. The decision to put Travolta's villain in the spotlight and casting the hero aside was instrumental in killing the spirit of the original story. Not to mention they totally omitted second part after Humans' victory over the Psychlos.

Even if the director was not a complete dope, this still would be far from satisfactory."

The RiffTrax for this is hilarious and helps immensely in dulling the pain that this induces, and rewatching this with that, as I did, can help a lot to restore a chunk of the faith in humanity that you may have lost in your initial viewing. I recommend this to those who refuse to listen to the warnings of those of us who are unlucky enough to have watched this tripe. 1/10"
1037,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"Allow me a moment to pick my jaw up off the floor.

Usually, I find that reports about something being the ""worst"" this or the ""best"" that are exaggerated. Well, I don't know if ""Battlefield Earth"" is the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's got to be a contender.

If I taught a film class, I would actually show a movie like ""Battlefield Earth"" to my students, because I think you can learn more about how important things like editing, writing, cinematography, etc. are when they're done badly. And man are they done badly in this stinker. In fact, they don't get anything right.

John Travolta and Forest Whitaker have three Oscar nominations and one win between them, which is enough to discount the value of the Oscars altogether. Whitaker probably comes off the better of the two. He may be costumed to look like Oprah Winfrey from her fat years, but he gets far fewer lines, and therefore opportunities to embarrass himself. Travolta, on the other hand, assumes a dandified, English aristocratic accent for some reason, and delivers one howler after another. It's unclear to me whether or not he realizes how bad this movie is and is hamming it up on purpose for lack of anything better to do or thinks he's really contributing to something of value.

Yikes -- you see something like ""Battlefield Earth"" and realize you might need to recalibrate your bad movie meter. I've seen a whole lot of crappy movies that look like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" compared to this.

Grade: Z (to give this movie a mere F would be an insult to other movies I've given that rating to)"
1038,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"This is truly a horrid movie. But (maybe..) worth watching once because it's an instant, modern camp classic.

Now, if you notice, I only submit bad reviews to this site, but that's because bad movies are a hobby of sorts for me. I'm one who thinks you can learn more about film from bad movies than good ones, and if there is any thuth to that, every film student's thesis should be written about Battlefield Earth.

You don't just wonder what they were thinking. You're amazed that so many people had to be so incompetent for this movie to get released. It defies comprehension. They had the budget, some (well, ok.. ) 'capable' (servicable might be a better term) actors.. so how could any outfit fail so miseraby?

It's an amazing film in all the ways that it sucks. It combines all the elements of a horrid film - employs characters which don't develop in any way, that you don't care about (or even root against), who act in very irrational or excessively stupid ways for the purpose of lengthening the film or serving the plot. The very worst part of all (and how you can do this I've no idea) is that the movie is boring and abrasive at the same time. It's like repeatedly being stabbed while still being in that place between sleep and awake where you don't really care about anything.

The crawl at the beginning, as well as the constant screen wipes, are a complete rip-off of Star Wars. I hesitate to even mention that film in this review. Worse yet, the script spends about a third of the film playing out things that you already know from the crawl! That aliens or whatever took over earth and killed most of the humans, the ones who still live are living in mostly tribal cultures. But, you're still subjected to quite a lot of them 'discovering' what is going on... which you were told before the movie even started. Why waste my time like that?

Immediately, the cheese in this movie starts to get thick. You get the Hero (tm) riding a white horse, his love interest, the crotchety old tribal elder, the Hero knowing the truth though no one believes him... blah blah blah.

Soon you start to notice that the screenplay is completely offensive to watch. In an effort to be 'cutting-eduge', a lot of the film is short from these tilted camera angles, what you would see if you tilted your head 45 degrees to one side. When it's not giving you a neck cramp from the camera angles, ripping off Star Wars with screen wipes, ripping off John Woo (poorly) with rapidly changing camera angles during combat scenes, you are treated (ahem) to gratutious use of slow-motion. Yes, there is more slow-motion here than in a whole season's worth of Monday Night Football. It's all part of a directorial scheme that really seems very patronizing to the viewer.

Details in virtually ever scene evoke that ""yeah, right"" reflex from the viewer. Such as, in the shopping mall where the glass is still relatively clean (after 1,000 years), characters using 20th century phrases such as ""the grass is greener on the other side"" or ""piece of cake"", which have apparently survived 1,000 years worth of dialect evolution and humanity's near extinction. Or, when Ker doesn't notice the ""hidden"" camera (obviously in view of anyone with half a brain, and on top of that, it makes loud noises when it zooms!). But, good thing Travolta just-so-happens to have placed these cameras in the city sewers (we all know how much excitement there is down there), or he never would have seen our hero escaping. Other intelligence-insulting garbage occurs, such as when the cave-people learn to pilot fighter jets in a week, nuclear warheads are found in still-working order 1,000 years in the future,

The alien costumes are pretty retarded, but I can't really complain because that fits the aliens, who have to be the stupidest race ever to conquer a planet and enslave a race. For example, the aliens are very intersted in gold, but didn't seem to locate Fort Knox. Or worse yet, when the enslaved humans are sent to mine gold (which, in this movie, is found in big chunks in the ground), and they come back with gold bars, the aliens think nothing of it. huh? The slang the Psychlos use is puzzling too. They call humans ""man-animals"", but just call dogs ""dogs"". They refer to air as ""breath-gas"", and the hidden cameras not as cameras, but ""picto-cameras"". Oooh! How high tech that sounds!

You get the idea. Picture a movie that tried to be Star Wars. Now, subtract any sort of compelling storyline, any well-done action scenes at all, any characters that you care about their survival. Make the hero(s) stupid and the villians even more stupid. And still, the whole comes out to be less than the sum of its parts.

Run - don't walk - away from this piece of crap. And if you like bad movies - don't bother. You can't laugh at this. It's just unwatchable. To borrow a phrase, this smacks of the Yiddish theatre in space.

To be accurate with my overall rating, I might have to use negative scientific notation. But, I'll just leave it at 0/10. I could actually feel myself becoming stupider with each passing minute."
1039,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"Yes, the heading is all you need to know. Elaborate explanations and references to actual events or specifics in the movie are simply unnecessary. Imagine every aspect of a movie (dialogue, plot, script, acting etc) and then imagine it worse than any other movie ever made and you got it. It is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in every single aspect. So bad it's in a league of its own.

It really is a shame that IMDb only offers a scale of 1-10 to judge a movie by, since this otherwise would easily go far into negative numbers.

Some bad movies are funny to watch, simply because they are bad. The low quality itself a reason to watch them because of the entertainment value in complete and utter ineptitude. This one has no such entertainment value, it is just painful from start to end.

And scientology inspirations has got nothing to do with it. It is simply crap on completely its own merits."
1040,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"I watched Battlefield Earth today. Um yay? If you don't already know, Battlefield Earth is considered the worst movie of all time. When my dad and I recorded it on the DVR I was thinking, ""Oh boy, this is going to be hilarious."" Is it hilarious? Yes. Is it bad? Yes. Is it painful to watch? Oh yeah. Those who haven't seen this movie may be wondering, ""What's so bad about it?"" I'm wondering, ""Where do I even start?"" How about we start at the plot. It's garbage. Basically, a race of aliens called the ""Psychlos"" take over Earth following a nine minute battle (yes, nine minutes). A thousand years later, the last remaining humans become hunter-gatherers. But, the Psychlos come back to use the Earth as a mining facility. Terl, played by John Travolta, is furious for not being allowed to return to his home planet, decides to use the humans to mine gold for himself. But one dude named Jonnie Goodboy Tyler decides to revolt with the other prisoners. Huh. Is it just me, or is that really stupid? Plus, there are really idiotic plot elements that are impossible and hilarious. For example: A group of tribal men, who was never even mentioned until halfway into the movie, get into a flight simulator and train to take down the Pyschlos. About an hour later, there going all ""Star Wars"" fighter jet on them. How is that even possible? It takes years to learn how to fly, how were they able to master it in one day? There's more, but if I talked about all the mistaken plot elements, it would become really, really long. This movie is also based on Scientology. It's a controversial religion made by L. Ron Hubbard. It is, according to dictionary.com, ""a belief based on a person being an immortal spiritual being whose survival depends on him/her and his/her attainment of brotherhood with others and the universe."" Not only is that A, fake, but it's also B, stupid, and C, a horrible excuse for a plot element. I swear, there are so many things wrong with the story of this movie. The acting is really bad, which is kind of sad because some of them are decent actors. Like the main character. Is he a decent actor? Yes. Did he do a good job in this movie? No. No he didn't. But no one, not a single actor could compare to the sheer awfulness of John Travolta. Terl is the most obnoxious, annoying, stupid, douchebag of a character I have ever seen in my life. He thinks humans are stupid, he's the smartest alien ever, and has the gut busting cackle. After watching this movie, I started literally hating John Travolta. When you think of a sci-fi movie, you think of CGI. Yes, Battlefield Earth has it, but it sucks. I've seen B-movies with better special effects than this movie. Everything looks fake, the lasers are copy-paste with a ripple effect when it hits, the explosions lack impact, the scenery is bland, and the flight simulator scenes look like an alpha stage of an FPS game. It just looks bad. The cinematography is some of the worst I've ever seen. It gets way to close to their faces and looks like it's filmed at a sideways angle. Plus the editing is really choppy. There are way to many unnecessary slow motion scenes. I swear, there are at least 70. Plus some lines of dialogue are repeated more than once in an overly dramatic way and some just come out with no sound whatsoever. And the transitions to the next scene are literally the exact same every time! I-it just RRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGHH!!! Speaking of dialogue, that's something else that sucks in this movie. Everything that everyone says is really cheesy. Some of the lines are totally unnecessary too. The most unnecessary come from John Travolta. Everything he says is dumb. Literally. Every. Sentence. Overall, this movie is like a bomb detonating in your stomach. If there's anything redeemable about this movie, it's the soundtrack, which is somewhat decent (I use that term loosely). This is one of those movies that you don't watch because you want to enjoy quality film. You would want to watch this if you're with your friends and you like to make fun of terrible movies. As a B-Movie, it would have been decent because of its humor (yes, the movie is pretty unintentionally funny). As a full fledged movie in theaters with box office numbers, which it is, it is an abomination for the eyes. Do not watch unless you're ready to make fun of it. That's the only way you'll get entertainment out of this piece of crap."

The constant Dutch angles, Travolta's horrible overacting, the crap visual effects, the flat cinematography, it was badness overload. I'm not even going to go into the whole howl at the moon insane Scientology aspect of the film.

An hour and a half into it, I turned off the TV and went outside for a walk to the library, with the intention of burning all of L Ron Hubbard's SF novels. Worst Sci Fi film ever. Life is too short for this flaccid, D grade cinematic cancer. Avoid like her"
1043,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"I am ashamed to admit I watched this film 3 times. The first time was upon its release at the cinema. I walked out thinking, ""WTF? What did I watch?""

The second time was 2 years later, to confirm if it really was that bad. It was! The third time was to show a friend going through film school how ""not to make"" a film.

Now after seeing it that many times I can honestly NOT recommend it to anyone, unless they want 2 hours of pure torture. Of course almost everyone who has ever watched a film will be aware of this, since it has become universally known as a bad movie. As such it can be used for educational purposes; to show people how NOT to make a film.

Anyway, I will not go into too much detail as there are enough reviews here highlighting just how terrible this film is and the many plot holes. I will only add that all the negative reviews are true, but then the book is no better either. Essentially it is a bad film based on an equally bad story."

1045,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"So I was just out of high school when this movie came out, I recall all the promoting and advertising they did for it (Taco Bell Cups and the like). At the time I had no interest, John Travolta was the guy from Face/Off, Broken Arrow, and Pulp Fiction. Seeing him in a sci-fi action title didn't interest me in the least. So fast forward 15 years later and I catch this gem on DVD at a garage sale for $0.15 and I have to buy it. Why? Mostly because buying it second hand this way ensures none of my money goes to Scientology, but mainly because I was dared once before to watch this movie a few years ago and couldn't find a legit copy anywhere. So now I figured I would take that $5 challenge to sit through the whole movie start to end without interruption. Needless to say I lost $5.15 that day. This film is abysmal and is the reason why there needs to be a 0 rating on IMDb. There is not a single redeeming feature to the entire production: the credits are crap, the music is terrible, the acting is bad, the dialogue is forced and uninteresting, the special effects are not that special (this movie came out 7 years AFTER Jurassic Park and the effects in that are 1000 times better), the costumes are just ridiculous Mad Max rip offs, and the plot makes no sense whatsoever. Avoid this film unless it is for ironic reasons or to torture someone. Even then be forewarned there is a strong possibility you will fall asleep while watching it (as I did)."

Where should we begin? Let's start with the credits -- which show how cheap this production was. They couldn't even make cool looking credits like in ""Toy Story 2"". The acting was atrocious -- Barry Pepper, who was probably encouraged by an agent who was a Scientologist to do this movie, was awful, and John Travolta just plain overacted. They story is stupid, and if you knew the mere basics of Scientology would see that it is a superficial retelling of their OT III levels. The effects -- not even B-movie level effects. Cinematography -- what's with all the damn angle shots??? And that damn infernal wipe -- it was almost like Christian didn't know that other techniques existed.

i will give the benefit of the doubt that the actual book has a more comprehensive plot and that this movie is trying to cram in too much into a few scenes.

but really, it's the worst movie i've seen in a long while, ('Crow II' being the last one); even ID4 had light relief from Will Smith's wise-cracking or even good contrast interplay between Agents J & K.

B.E. didn't even have good FX going for it; the planet explosion was the lamest and can't even match Star Wars from 1977 or even Star Trek (3?) - when the Genesis Effect took place.

as far as heroes go, ""Johnnie"" (??!!) isn't exactly Braveheart, but how do you reconcile humanity reverting to cavemen and still have libraries intact, not to mention Fort Knox and Fort Hook(?) all within a hop, skip and a jump away - when the Psychlos(!) aren't looking...

Jay Leno wasn't kidding when he said it was ""bad"" - sadly i had to see it for myself to know just what he meant.

Hahahahahhahahaa... this was a joke, right? ...or not?

Battlefield Earth will go down in history not for its actual content, but because of its dismal fate of becoming the first total bomb of the new millenium. Travolta has definitely become blinded by hubris to produce and star in such an awful film such as this, and dragging Forest Whitaker down with him...

This was the first movie I've gone to in a long while expecting it to be bad, and boy did I get my money's worth. It wasn't quite as bad as I thought, but still wretched enough to make even Roland Emmerich wince in embarrassment. On top of the fact that the plot is totally unbelievable, borrowed from countless other films, and often makes no sense whatsoever... NOTHING in this film works! Terrible editing and cinematography mostly contribute to its downfall with bad overuse of tilted cameras, close-ups, and barn-door-open transitions... it's as if a bunch of kids made this movie, messing with options and tricks just to ""see what they would do"". Besides a few impressive effects (at times) this movie is a real joke and really hard to watch. So many pointless characters and so few relevant plot-points, stupid costumes, bad lighting, bad make-up, no continuity, and completely unimaginative aliens, who look and act just like humans (even the bartender runs up tabs for his customers) dressed as cheap Klingon extras at a Star Trek convention! Caught right in the middle of this mess is John Travolta, who shamelessly promotes this film across the world along with his bogus religion $cientology...

There is Policy Academy movie bad. And then there is Battlefield Earth bad. I present this analogy. Picture movie Utopia, where Star Wars Episode 1 lived up to the hype and more. It was the end-all and be-all of sci-fi. Well, that's what BE made Wing Commander look like. I hated all the characters and didn't care what happened to them. The plot was laugh out loud ""yeah, right"" even by summer movie standards. The dialogue was beyond pointless by same standards. And as one of the reviewers put it, someone had better audit the special effects team to see what happened to all the money. Why? Why was this movie made? Who besides John Travolta thought this movie was a good idea? Maybe this movie got made just to shut him up for awhile. Roger Corman, I mean Christian, would do well to brush this one under the rug.

It must be seen in order to believe and truly understand how wretched it is.

I could wax eloquent for pages and pages attempting to describe how awful this pile of Psychlo-Dung really is, but I could never do justice to the utter disaster that is the film ""Battlefield Earth.""

I feel this movie will have its place in future film schools. It will be required viewing for all film students, as the perfect example of what NOT to do.

Now, before all of you start comparing me to Mr. Cranky (the internet film critic who manages to find the awful in every movie), I must remind you that as of this time, 1,100 IMDB users have given this movie an average rating of 3 out of 10.

The plotholes (big enough to drive Battlestar Galactica through). The scenery (I've seen more realistic matte paintings in movies where you're supposed to know they're matte paintings). The ridiculous lift shoes the Psychlos wore (Gene Simmons would laugh his butt off if he saw this film and saw what these people had to wear). The Psychlos overall appearance (whatever reviewer said ""They're Jamaican Klingons that speak like Ferrengi"" hit a bullseye). John Travolta's dialogue (Oh my God, I can't even begin to get into that dreck). The effects (visible wires holding the model ships up would have been better--at least they'd be enjoyable to laugh at). The truly inconceivable stupidity of the Psychlos (how could they possibly conquer so many other civilizations when they repeatedly demonstrate utter idiocy). And Barry Pepper's ""fight for freedom"" speech (I half-expected Mel Gibson to make a cameo appearance as William Wallace, knock Pepper to the ground, and serve him lawsuit papers for plagiarism).

1061,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"I actually went to see this crappy movie when it came out, and never before have I felt so completely cheated out of time in my life. I knew going in that movie was based on the series by L. Ron Hubbard, liar, con, fraud, bigamist, tax cheat, cult leader, etc, etc, yet I was still willing to suspend my prejudice in the hopes that his fictional writing might somehow be translated successfully from the trailing threads of his fabricated life.

I was wrong.

I managed to squirm in my seat as I sat through this miserable excuse for a movie only to be granted a brief respite to use the restroom. It was at that point that I'd considered leaving the theater, perhaps even demanding a refund. Still, there was a niggling sliver of doubt that perhaps I just wasn't giving the movie enough of a chance, that maybe it would get better near the end. So upon flushing the toilet, I'd returned to my seat with fresh eyes, and proceeded to writhe even worse that I had before, despite having just used restroom. Needless to say, the movie and I should have switch places halfway through the showing. It should have been consigned to being flushed down the toilet while I made shadow puppets in the projector beam for the audience's amusement.

Honestly, I think I would have been more entertaining, and a hell of a lot less insulting to their intelligence. At the very least, they could have given me their pocket change for charity, or perhaps even pity for having suffered through the movie, and it would have been a better use of their money. Only they were in the same predicament I was in - we were all out the cost of several 40 oz. bottles of malt liquor and a swift kick to the genitals, both of which would have been preferable to this scam that we'd fallen victim to (Hubbard's soggy ashes must be gargling in laughing amid the scum of the sea floor).

As far as the movie itself goes, the plot was so thin and full of holes that you could have flown a 1000 year old jet through them. The acting was so pathetic and lacking in effort that it was painful to endure, and the dialog? A cruel joke. The special effects, props and costumes all seem cobbled together with bubblegum and bailing wire and should have been piled into a steaming heap, doused with gasoline and burned along with the script and the master reels until nothing remains but ashes.

Given the option to see this horrid movie, do yourself a favor, and do something else with your time instead. Even if it's spent looking at a blank wall for and hour and a half contemplating its hues, shades and textures, considering the alternative, it's time well spent."

Thats why the original Die-hard worked so well, everything was done with a wink and a nod. From the over the top New Joisey hero, to the subtly comic villain.

Roger Christian fails at all four of those and what do we get? Over-The-Top acting, horrible dialogue, noisy action sequences, and forgettable characters. Even the music was pretty generic.

The acting is truly horrible (Travolta in particular is embarrassingly bad here), the story riddled with holes, the dialogue truly laughable. The visuals had a few interesting moments, but they were too few and far between to pull this stinker from the crapper.

So, all I can think now is that I was horribly wrong when I enjoyed the book so long ago. Must remember to not read it again. Ever.

And to finish, a question: why the hell did the 'man animals' grunt at each other like chimps? Some kind of misguided commentary on ""reverse evolution""? Oh dear..."

1071,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"Now, I'm not above a terrible movie for it's own sake. I love watching films where zombies or aliens or alien zombies are killing precocious teens by the dozens, but I just couldn't get into BE, not even for the sake of dear camp.

Oh, sure, it's a laugh, but it takes a dedicated afficionado of bad movies to sit this thing through. Apparently, every phrase with maniacal laughter was cut out of the video, but as I haven't seen it yet, I can't confirm. As it is, you've probably read through the plot summary, which makes Star Wars look like War and Peace. The camerawork hurts to watch, the effects are cheesetacular, especially considering the obvious effort they went through.

But what this movie REALLY lacks is any of the actors, even in the slightest, understanding the bloated badness and sharing the joke with us. Sure, that works for a short Ed Wood flick, but for a huge Hollywood hemmorage? Please. I want at least ONE smile and wink.

For all those conspiracy theorists out there, there isn't even anything like any of L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology theories in it, except possibly that the bad guys are called Psychlos as some sort of nod to his dislike of psychiartry.

The horrible thing is that might have made the movie better."
1072,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"As one of my favorite childhood books, I semi-eagerly awaited the release of this film (only 'semi-eagerly' as I was fairly sure that quite a bit would be lost in translating to film). I even talked my wife (who usually avoids pulp SciFi) into reading the first half of the novel (which the movie covers).

I was unable to see film during the first few weeks, and I heard nothing but dreadful reviews of this movie. Hence, I went to see it with low expectations.

I was unprepared. It was a bit like being told by a doctor that ""this might hurt a bit"" and then being decapitated. Nothing can prepare you for such an awful experience. Beyond a certain point, nothing made you want to look at the screen any longer.

The most staggering thing about this movie is this: It. Cost. $73. Million. Dollars. To. Make. Surely they mean 73 million Lira or Yen, no? This is shocking only because the film looked so impressively low-budget. It used goofy lighting effects that made everything impossible to resolve. Was this to be mysterious? Give the illusion that there were scary ""things"" just beyond your sight? Doubtful. Likely, in the grand tradition of Ed Wood, the darkness hid the fact that the sets were either missing or unconvincing.

And for good measure, the cameras are rotate about 30 degrees from the horizontal at random points in the film (the angle carefully calculated to guarantee you get a headache). Why? Just to complete a truly ruinous experience."
1073,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"Picture this. There is this caveman, ok? Raised a hunter-gatherer in a pagan world. OK? No problem. He's in a Harrier Jump Jet. Ok? He has just crashed the plane into a huge dome at an astounding speed on purpose. He's not hurt at all. Ok? He sees crates of fuel and explosives, lying for absolutely no reason on top of this dome, right next to him. Ok? He takes out a bazooka which he luckily remembered to bring, and blows the fuel, explosives, the dome and himself to smithereens. Ok? So, what is this, one of those silly Zuckerman movies like 'The Naked Gun', where the surreal is the order of the day? Nope. Is it a comedy at all? Nope. It's the latest sci-fi thriller from John Travolta and pals, BATTLEFIELD EARTH.

Now, maybe the situation of a caveman flying an airplane into a dome and blowing it all up with weirdly placed props is explained. Ok, so it's a little farfetched, but it's all explained in a way so that it's believable, right?

Let me answer that in the manner of a Psychlo: BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! In man-animal-language, that means 'No way. This movie is so downright stupid and boring that it defies belief'. The last half hour or so is fun because it's just so insanely stupid and intelligence-insulting, but everything before that is a boring waste of time. It's not even bad in a fun way, it's bad in a 'I will rip your arm off and beat you to death with the bloody end'-way.

Anyway, the lowdown is this: The year is 3000, and mankind, we are told, is an endangered species. It turns out Earth was invaded by Psychlos (Klingons without the charm) about 1000 years ago and wiped the entire planet clear of humans. Almost. Because Psychlos are vulnerable to radiation (it makes their breathing gas explode - yes of course it does), the humans live in radioactive areas where the Psychlos can't get them.

We join our hero, Jonnie, as he learns his father was taken by the gods. Oh la la. He gets all stroppy and instantly starts leaking Hero Juice all over his torn caveman clothes. ""We must fight or we will never be free! Boo! Boo!"" He yells and everyone ignores him. But off he goes, into the unknown. In the unknown there is a huge golf ball for absolutely no reason. If you've seen it, you'd have noticed.

Also in the unknown are other humans, who buddy up with Jonnie. Then, all of a sudden, the shadow of a Psychlo turns up and starts shooting green balls of light after them. Sometimes the gun says 'BANG', other times it says 'ZAP' and other times still it says nothing at all. The sound effects guy was really concentrating on that one.

Anyway, Jonnie and his new buddies are captured by the Psychlos, and we are introduced to John Travolta Psychlo and Forrest Whittaker Psychlo. They both look, and are, stupid. Jonnie shoots a few Psychlos and is not punished for it, and then he has a pointless fight with someone in a cage. All the while, the Psychlos are acting incredibly pointlessly and stupidly, and they get a disproportionate amount of screen time. This goes on for about 45 minutes where nothing - and I mean NOTHING - happens. Not a jot. Zip. Just a lot of talking, yelling (for the humans) and laughing insanely (for the Psychlos).

I must mention the Psychlo sense of humour, since it is all over this endless 45 minutes. The joke is always the same: one Psychlo says: ""Oh no, WE will not kill you."" The other Psychlo says ""Oh thank Hubbard for that! I thought my days were numbered"" (the actual dialogue from the film was, believe it or not, much worse than this example.) ""No"", says the first Psychlo, ""WE will not kill you. But *I* will kill you!"". Second Psychlo looks stunned with surprise and gets shot. First Psychlo: ""BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!"" And that's it. The joke is always reading the sentence to the letter and then finding a little loophole to exploit. The other Psychlo is always fooled by this, even though he has heard this kind of joke at least a million times before and has used the jokes himself a million times. This sort of joke is endlessly referred to as being 'leverage'. If you get bored (and you will) then count the number of times the word 'leverage' is uttered.

Meanwhile, back at the movie, someone seems to have remembered that a movie needs a plot of some sort. Ok, so we're told that the Psychlos are mining the Earth for gold. Since they have incredible technology like intergalatic teleportation and the like, they of course have an advanced spectroscopy machine to locate the gold ore via satellite. Oh, wait, no they don't. They just happen to find a gold mine in a radioactive mountain. OK, we know that Psychlos are allergic to radiation, so they of course just deploy some robotic miner. No, hang on, they don't have robotic miners. So they want to use the man-animals to mine the gold for them. So, they pick Jonnie, because he's the hero, and teach him everything about the psychlo language and how to mine, so he can teach the others. While they are at it, they also teach him everything he needs to know about Psychlo security codes and procedures, because that's really relevant. They also teach him how to read human language somehow, and he is taken to a library where he is allowed to read as much as he wants about anything he feels like. We notice that the Psychlos are very good at keeping their slaves ignorant so they don't start a rebellion or anything. Oh yeah and he is taught to fly a Psychlo plane as well.

They are dumped by the radioactive gold mine and told to get going. To keep an eye on them he has a drone fly by the mine once every 24 hours or so. The Psychlo DO in fact have little miniature cameras with a huge range, but they seem to forget that and opt for the inefficient drone option instead. This gives Jonnie the change to forget about mining and just fly to FORT KNOX to get the gold! Yes, Fort Knox! The most enforced place on the planet, impossible to penetrate. Unless you're cavemen of course, in which case the outer door is just a piece of sheet metal you can knock over, and the door to the vault is left wide open. When the Psychlos go back for the gold, they don't wonder for one minute how the humans got the 'mined' gold smelted into bar form without any sort of equipment.

The Fort Knox part leads into the stupid and fun part of the movie. I won't tell too much to spoil it for you, but the caveman in a harrier jump jet scene kinda sums it up. Oh, and look out for the effect of one atomic bomb on the Psychlo home planet.

In short, I wouldn't call this a bad film. I would call this an absolutely, mindwrenchingly terrible film. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! (Psychlo Humour again)"
1074,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"I didn't think it would be possible for something like this to even release widely in theaters, thanks to how overly abysmal it is, but it happened, unfortunately. Because, oh god, where do I even start? The writing is unbelievably bad, the production is really sub-par, the costume design is never more than ugly, the performances are filled to the brim with camp, the dialogue is dumb, and the overall structure of this film is no more intact than water in a cage. Not even the talents of John Travolta or Forest Whitaker could come close to saving this dumpster fire. If anything, their characters and their terrible dialogue and premises only add fuel to it. This crap was straight-up painful to sit through, and not in the same way as other bad films. Somehow, this film actually hurts to watch in it's entirety, because of how stupid the writing is and how ugly each shot looks and how poorly everything is put together. Everything is just baffling, because there's not only nothing redeemable, but somehow, it's got stuff that goes against what a good film is. Usually, with bad films, they simply lack good things. Here, not only does it lack good things, but it adds insult to injury by incorporating Dutch angles everywhere, as well as wipe transitions you could find in Windows Movie Maker, also everywhere in this film. It makes an already atrocious film look not only uglier, but kind of amateur. This film really is one of, if not the worst film ever made, at least in the past few decades, because this transcends the crap levels to unbelievable levels. And the worst part is that it's not even funny in an ironic sense. Films like ""The Room"", ""Batman and Robin"", ""Sharknado"" etc. are all abysmal, but at least they were pleasant to sit through thanks to how hilariously awful they were, which made for a fun and humorous time, especially with friends. Here, it's just annoying and depressing, because unlike the aforementioned films, this film is, indeed, taking itself very seriously, so when it fails, it's not even that entertaining or funny. The only kind of ironically funny part of this film is at the end where they were setting up for a sequel, which, obviously, never happened (THANK GOD), but that is it. The fact that this film is the way it is, as well as the fact that it even got made to begin with shows how little of a crap Hollywood gave about quality in 2000, and I know you may think I'm being harsh, but it's really that bad. I lost brain cells watching this, and because of that, I recommend everyone to just avoid this like the plague. Go watch Star Wars, instead, which is something that this film was obviously trying to rip off. I know it's based off of a book, but it doesn't take a genius that this film has little to nothing original about it. Please, do yourself a favor and watch literally anything else. I gave this film a fair chance to see if the critics and audiences were wrong, and somehow, it was worse. I just want to know why this film is the way it is. Seriously. Good lord. Why?!"

1078,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"0/4 BOMB

I've seen a lot of films I couldn't stand. I've seen a lot of films that bored me four-fifths to death. In all of my cinema experiences spanning across a century of filmmaking, I have never seen a movie fail so miserably in comparison to Battlefield Earth. I am not alone in my hatred of my film, nor am I the first... it has the awards to prove it if you don't believe me.

In a movie, you need to be able to escape into (or at the very least care about) the events happening on screen. Battlefield Earth is more disconnected from its audience than any movie I've ever seen. Since there is no legitimate effort to get you the viewer involved, the other problems in this movie are really glaring.

Director Roger Christian opts to shoot 95% of the scenes in Battlefield Earth with extreme (and I mean extreme) dutch angles to create the feel of a comic book. The only similarity to a comic I could find was the 2-Dimensional delivery, replete with ridiculous looking CGI. What results from this excersize is a good migrane and the realization that there is no vision behind the camera. Christian has much more learning to do in this department, as he was previously a second unit director for Star Wars Episode I, doing transition shots.

As far as ""acting"" goes, try 5 Golden Razzies. John Travolta, playing the lead Psychlo, takes home the decade's worst preformance. Our hero Jonnie Goodboy, as played by Barry Pepper, transitions between incompetent and preforming highly advanced mathematical equations. His violent and very primitive outbursts at his superiors, and his rocket science caliber mind around his own race of ""man-animals"" is all but a lazy portrayal of a character to whom you are apathetic.

The screenplay is either complex to the point of confusion, or downright silly. None of the characters are even proportioned enough to hold up the choppiness of it all. I still want to know how the man-animals imploded an entire planet with one well-placed bomb. Maybe this will be reconciled in a follow up movie.

In the movie, someone says to Travolta's character: ""But when you die and go to hell, it'll be a step up from this place"". That proves to be the seminal line of the film. Even if you don't make it ""up there"", you won't have to co-exist with Battlefield Earth forever."
1079,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,This has to be the low life movie in an actor's career. John Travolta plays the character that is a cross between his character in Saturday night fever and an alien he was trying to be funny but boy was his acting horrible and he was not funny at all. The main character in the picture seem to always be running someplace and most of the time was in slow motion. It's hard to believe that no one else has made any type of reviews or comments on this movie it is just horrible the CGI is pretty good but the acting left a lot to be desired. I would have to say this is probably more of a comedy due to the poor act
1080,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,Before watching this catastrophe I assumed the low score had something to do with Scientology.

1081,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"Hey guys so here it is it is the movie that nobody asked for , no one gave a s*** about it and it worst too many razzies it is already known like one of the worst movies of all time and ladies and gentlemens I present you battlefield earth. Is it good of course it is right nope it is F****** terrible. What was this even about like DA fudge here are reasons why this movie sucks and there's no spoilers nope no spoilers anyway don't even watch it.

Five reasons why battlefield earth sucks 1. The characters : the characters are terrible really bad they are unfunny and I believe they are mental like why the heck are these people but john travolta character was the worst character of all time Yes his character was terrible and unfunny. 2. Villain : do you call this guy aka terl a villain really he just acts like a clown he isn't even trying we can't take him seriously to be our villain at least kylo ren try ed and did better. 3. Design : just forgettable really stupid. 4. Story and plot : wait I don't need to talk about the story and plot why? Well guess what there is no story after all. 5. Acting : horrendous they act like clowns they are not even trying and john travolta my man he is ignoring his roles and he is pretty bad in this movie he just sucks.

Take my word guys don't even watch this crap it is known like one of the worst movies of all time and they are so damn right."
1082,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"I always avoided Battlefield Earth whenever it was on TV because I heard it was bad. Well, it happened to come on while I was in the midst of doing some work around the house and I didn't bother to change the channel... All I can say is, I will never leave my television unattended again!!!

This is, by far, one of the worst films I have ever seen! I stared at my TV in total disbelief at the complete stupidity of this! Maybe it was meant to be a farce? Not since Zardoz have I sat there and wondered, ""WTF am I watching???"" At least Zardoz had Sean Connery!

So it's way way in the future - like a thousand years. Human civilization was conquered by aliens long ago, called ""Psychlos"", who have big heads with dreadlocks and wear platform Frankenstein boots! Yes, I said dreadlocks! - I suddenly feel a bad reggae song coming on -

What's left of humanity lives pretty much as slaves to the aliens and have been reduced to the level of cave people. They even grunt like apes when they fight. Seriously! It's laughable to watch. But, when they are not grunting, they actually speak very good English.

So one human (Pepper) is randomly selected to learn alien technology so he can perform some secret work for the big boss dread-locked alien, played by a rather comical Travolta. Pepper decides instead to use this new found wisdom to rally the humans and . . . ""Stand up! Stand up! Stand up for their rights!"" (Sorry, couldn't help it) Long story short, in 7 days (seriously, SEVEN days) Pepper and a handful of humans learn how to fly harrier jets that have been sitting for 1000 years and are perfectly clean and shiny with absolutely no rust - not to mention the fuel that has managed to stand the test of time! Which is an incredible feat because the gas in my snowblower won't last until the next winter!

The special effects are sub par for the generation, the costumes are just ridiculous! The dread-locked aliens bear a striking resemblance to Klingons from Star Trek the Next Generation and the humans all appear to have long hair mullets but are clean shaving. They are very clean cave men!

I'll give it a star because I couldn't help but laugh at the stupidity of it all. And if you need to laugh at something stupid, this is your movie! Otherwise, avoid at all costs and by all means, do not leave your television unattended!!!"
1083,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"Hollywood has done it again. As per usual big budget Hollywood sci-fi, we again have beautiful visuals, effects, and cinematography...but where's the story? It seems that this one key fact has been overlooked again and again. This film makes Mission to Mars actually look like a decent movie and it was pretty bad too. My other qualm, the dialog is unnatural and childish. At one point, a character refers to the earth as a ""ball of crap"" and later, another character says ""What the crap?"" Fire the writers, I hope they were blacklisted. See this for only one reason, to make fun of it...also make sure it's not your money spent on renting it either. I wasted 2 hours and 20 minutes of my l"

There are enough bad elements of this film to keep the man and his robots speaking continuously throughout the film... ... just be sure not to get cricks in your necks from the diagonal camera angles. The producers and directors of this film need to drink their V8s before filming in the future.

In summary, the plot inconsistencies (to numerous to mention), wanton disregard for basic scientific principles, and lack of philosophical coherency (... NO THERE IS NO HIDDEN DEPTH IN THIS FILM ... IT IS JUST PLAIN BAD!!!!) results in a rating of 1/4 stars out of 4. Believe me, that is being generous to the worst film I have ever seen in MY ENTIRE L"
1085,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"OK, this movie sucked. It sucked on levels that I was not even sure that a film could legitimately suck on. In response to comments that I have seen from others, Battlefield Earth is NOT too deep, did my undergraduate in Philosophy, I know Ancient Greek and Latin and study Plato... no third rate sci-fi writer from the 20th century is going to get over on me. Battlefield Earth is NOT too bleak... I like bleak post-apocalypse films, the darker the better. Battlefield Earth is simply too stupid.

This film failed as a thriller/drama, because the characters were so wooden and unbelievable that I really did not care one little bit about anything that they did or what happened to them. And the acting and dialogue were so horrendous that I felt like I was watching a highschool play.

It failed as sci-fi because it did not tell us anything about ourselves or the human condition, and the science was a bit too fictional.

It failed as an action film, because the action scenes were done poorly. Slo-mo, tilted cameras and echo-chambers do NOT heighten drama on their own, they must be used in conjunction with something else.

It failed as a promotion of Scientology, because the only lesson that I got from it was that if you are mad at one member of a race of people then it is apparently ok to commit genocide on them as a whole. I saw no evidence in the film that the human characters were justified in blowing up the whole psychlo planet, beyond the fact that a more reasonable solution would have been too complex for Hubbard or the cast and crew of the film to understand.

And the fact that when the psychlo planet blows up I felt not one iota of excitement or joy, or even anger, just sort of an extension of the emptiness that I felt through most of the film. This is not some liberal whining about the evils of imperialism or anything, if the plot had demonstrated to me that the planet should be blown up and the psychlos wiped out I would have cheered and yelped like an idiot, but I simply don't remember that part of the plot. All I saw was that Terl was a jerk so the psychlos must die, if that is the lesson that Scientology wants to teach, then I think we should be a bit concerned.

This film was so remarkably bad that I began laughing about 10 minutes into it and stopped soon after. After sitting in the theater for what felt like days, I looked at watch to see that only an hour had passed. I communicated this fact to my friends who responded in horror. We stayed to the end, but it was not worthwhile.

This film has replaced Popeye the Movie as the worst film I have ever seen, because it had a huge budget, relatively talented cast and crew and still was not particularly more interesting than watching a blank screen for 2 hours. Big budget films continue to get lamer and lamer while American tastes and standards continue to decline.

The 'tributes' to older sci-films (or just rip-offs) sucked, I was unimpressed by the little Blade Runner montage at the beginning (as that whole scene just sucked), as I was by what appeared to be a remake of the infamous riot scenes in Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (is that the right one? the second to last film anyway), which was itself based on the Watts riots. There were other examples, but those were the two lamest.

I won't even get into the inconsistencies and improbabilities of the plot, because they have been well-documented elsewhere, and besides, they are not the reason that this film was so bad. The 1000 year old fighter planes, the man-animals flying harriers, the flight simulators at Ft. Bragg (which I am assured are not there) all would have been fine in a film that was not created by the mentally impared. This film was so bad, and so lame, and so terrible that it will be the yardstick against which all bad sci-fi will be measured in the future.

Comparing this film to Ed Wood's work would be an insult, as Wood at least appeared to love film. This movie is almost toxic in its disrespect for both its medium and its audience."
1086,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"The original book was based on a 1940's style that was woefully out of date even then. I feel a grave tactical mistake was done trying to preserve the book plot. There's enough plot holes to start with in the book, abridging the book with the excuse they had for the script did nobody a favor. I realize they had crap to work with, I just don't see why it had to be worsened with all sorts of odd gimmicks. The story was a disaster to start with, I guess there was an impetus to try to improve the obvious failings. Avoid this movie. Even if you love the books. It will give nothing but a TV miniseries view to it. I suspect the networks could have done a better job with a lot less money.

I'm probably one of a handful of non-Scientologists to admit I read the book this is based on. It was a guilty pleasure. It was simplistic, racist, and sexist, but hey, it was a fun read.

The movie is much, much worse. There are many situations where the book actually made sense (within its context) where the movie just didn't bother. Travolta's acting was a disgrace. Actually, forget it -- *EVERYONE'S* acting was horrible. Granted, it was horrible enough to be funny, but it was still horrible. The Psychlos are egregiously stupid; they seem to interact with each other on the level of a five year old (""Well, I said _I_ wouldn't kill him. I'll have X kill him."" Oh, come on).

Cheesy special effects. Horrible plot holes. Bad acting. Lots and lots of dirt flying around. I'd have to say this is easily one of the worst movies I've ever willingly subjected myself to.

The film, however, dumbs-down the story, characters and action so much that all the good qualities of the book are completely lost. Very rarely do screen adaptions match the appeal of the book, but Battlefield Earth's concoction of idiotic characters, plot holes, bad acting, and lapses in logic came from ineptness and not from any demands of the film medium.

With this one film director Roger Christian has shot to the top of my ""Really Bad Directors List"", easily replacing the likes of Michael Bay and Simon West. Christian's reliances on wipes and tilted camera angles doesn't cover up the fact that he has no clue how to frame a scene or how to get his cinematographer to use more than a 40-watt lightbulb to light the picture.

Critics long feared that this movie would have been a Scientology propoganda flick due to the author of the book. From what little I know about Scientology I can't find any of it in this picture and I think that's a shame. Such a picture would be far more interesting than this waste of time."

1095,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"As someone who does his research, I find it hard to believe that Scientologists haven't done a mass spamming of 10-Star ratings to get this movie into the top 250. But then I remember there aren't enough Scientologists to counter common sense.

The story is based off a book that can best be described as pulp. It's cliché, over the top, unrealistic and the human hero is a self-insertion of L. Ron's on belief that he was the greatest man to have ever lived. And that's not true by a long shot, since I'm here.

So anyway, the idea is that in the year 3000 CE humans are dominated by a malicious race known as ""Psychlos"" (L. Ron instilled a fear of Psychiartrists into Scientologists, or ""Psyches"" as he called them, claiming they were behind the concentration camps in Nazi Germany) and humanity has turned into a bunch of pack animals that eat rocks and rats. The Psychlos are using people to hunt for gold (again, one of L. Ron's batshit crazy beliefs) and misuse them and treat them like animals.

That's about as far as I got. I watched about 45 minutes of this crap and couldn't finish it. What has is bad has already been said and is deserving of the critique.

But take a moment to think about this. L. Ron wrote this...thing...and was meant to have written the 'holy' texts of the Church of Cashmaking, er, Scientology. If people are taking this as fact, then there is something wrong with them. As I said. I did my research. People believe this is going to be a real future event. Pathetic."
1096,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"This is definitely the movie people need to see before they take ""Scientology"" seriously. This is the future you buy into, folks - a battle between (vaguely African descent) aliens and (mostly white) humans, for an earth that is little more than a wasteland, following a global disaster caused by poor eugenics. Oh, give us a break! The action scenes are just so-so, but everything else about this cheap imitation for a movie is just laughably bad - and that's the only charm in it - it is so bad it is laughable.

The primary source of amusement is the (supposed) ""dialog"" - I especially like the aliens hissing at each other, it's so, well... meaningless.

The explosions are cool. The prison scenes are stolen from every prison movie of the 1930s. whatever good is to be found here could be found - better - in the old Star Trek TV show. And John Travolta - ! ha ha ha ha ha! Yes, a laugh riot, if you don't take it seriously."

WORST MISTAKE EVER.

First, I was so confused to the point I didn't even learn the characters names. I had to go on Wikipedia afterwards to figure that out. The acting was atrocious, and I sat through every single episode of Cavemen. I'm a bit of a Trekkie, I admit it, and I swear the makeup makes them all look like Klingons from that one Enterprise episode where there was a disease etc! I half expected Michael Dorn to walk out! Now, I think maybe three years after watching it, its awfulness still haunts me. This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I waste of my time.

DON'T EVEN WATCH IT TO MAKE FUN OF IT'S HORRENDOUSNESS. YOU WILL NOT SURVIVE."
1105,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"And 3000 years is about as much time as you'll guess you've been sitting there when the credits roll because, astonishingly, Battlefield Earth really is as bad as you've heard.

Aimed squarely at kiddies, it's impossible for adults to take seriously. The Psychlos are represented primarily by John Travolta and Forest Whitaker, but their brand of Disney villainy extends only to constant bickering which may well be unintentionally hilarious but it's not the least bit menacing. Indeed Travolta makes for one of the worst screen villains in recent memory, his Terl coming across as petulant, stroppy and very, very campy rather than the terrifying monster the film is so desperately crying out for. It's this need to keep things safe so the little 'uns won't be scared that saps any sense of danger from proceedings. I mean, his big evil plot is to use the humans to mine gold on the side so he can retire. Hardly Earth-shattering stuff. . .

Still, it's not all bad. Barry Pepper as the heroic Jonnie Goodboy Tyler is magnificent, expertly capturing the awesome personal charisma of the character and - oh who am I kidding? He's as dull as dishwater.

The modest budget shows in every frame, and much of it appears to have been filmed in the same warehouse re-dressed numerous times. It's all shot in tight close ups at wonky angles in an ill-fated attempt to hide the generally cheap nature of the thing. Right down to the hair extensions and prosthetic Psychlo hands it all has a compromised, that'll-do feel.

There are huge holes in the plot. And I'm talking about several of them. Gaping ones with barbed wire fencing and flashing warning signs around them to stop audiences falling in. However they're not as jaw-droppingly stupid as the massive chunks they either forgot or couldn't afford to include. But then again this is a film where spending a few hours in a library can enable a man who can't read to become knowledgeable on just about everything - including besting a warrior race at military strategy - and a couple of days in a flight simulator means you become an expert fighter pilot. Logic is not Battlefield Earth's strong point.

Neither is its score, a truly dreadful effort in which even the instruments it's played on sound like they were found in a skip.

The final battle is spectacularly inept, and springs from nowhere with no build-up. It's quite amusing actually; before you realise it's started it's there in front of you and then it's not.

But the most staggering thing about the film is that not only was it not knocked together by a bunch of disinterested monkeys, it was in fact a labour of love for John Travolta. This is something he'd wanted to make for years, so how it turned out so indescribably, monumentally atrocious is a mystery."
1106,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"Very rarely do you see a film with this high of a budget being unilaterally bad, imagine Ed Wood with more money and far less charm. Imagine the stupidest scenes in Independence Day coupled with the worst of Michael Bay's films and you really don't get close to how bad this film is. Everyone involved in this project is doing the worst thing they've ever done. This includes John Travolta who was also in Staying Alive, Two of a Kind and Swordfish, which are comparative masterpieces.

The cinematography (though no evidence exists to suggest that cameras weren't held by blind apes who pointed towards wherever noise was coming from) is consistently awful. The 'script' is bad enough to make George Lucas look as subtle as Tarkovsky, take for example:

Chirk: I am going to make you as happy as a baby Psychlo on a straight diet of kerbango.

The acting, considering the fairly accomplished people involved is laughably hammy. Barry Pepper and Forest Whittaker (though behind the make-up you can't really tell) are both lucky to have made this film and not subsequently been relegated to making soft-core porn and reality TV.

Filled with plot holes, poor special effects, bad acting, worse writing, no direction and a soundtrack that would annoy deaf people, this 'film' has less artistic merit than a theoretical snuff movie written by Joe Eszterhas, directed by Uwe Boll and staring Brendan Fraser. Truly and utterly abhorrent."

1111,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"L. Ron Hubbard's 1950's-style science fiction promo for Scientology has been made into an equally bad film. The plot is antiquated and harkens back to the late 40's when Hubbard, shipped out of the Navy after a dismal service record, joined the action sci-fi genre pioneered by Doc Smith, Van Vogt and others, to create mega-hero stories about men who did everything right while they battled transparently awful villains. In his book Hubbard pitted the remains of humankind, led by an arch-hero modeled after the old space opera heroes of the 40's and 50's who can do no wrong and who always wins, against the evil Psychlos, so named because, as Hubbard states at the end of the book, they were basically a good people until someone invented psychology which taught them that they were animals and thereby divested them of any spiritual or ethical basis to their society. Whereupon they spread through the galaxy, destroying populations and raping worlds. Hubbard in his paranoia always felt that the major impediment to society accepting Scientology, which is essentially a form of psychoanalysis whose invention he spearheaded, was the active antagonism of organized psychology and psychiatry, both of which were out to get him and to stop Scientology because ""they knew it really worked."" Each of Hubbard's childishly-written scifi epics since the 50's has implicitly battled against Psychology, hence the name ""Psychlos"". Look no further for the support of Scientologists for the film or for Travolta's compulsive and self-destructive desire to see the movie made at any cost - it was imperative that society ""wake up"" to the menace of psychology and to their reality that Scientology provided the only truly workable psychoanalysis in existence, and that it should be embraced by everyone as Scientologists attempt to ""clear the Planet.""

But Hubbard was such a poor (yet prolific) writer that it is only the massive financial power of organized Scientology, which charges a small fortune for its ""religious"" services (i.e. psychoanalysis renamed ""pastoral counseling""), that has moved along his books to best-seller status. That, and clever advance sales and coordinated drop shipping of titles to make that one-week punch on the NY Times bestseller list. But that's not enough to rescue a scifi movie that is patently awful and may well spell the end of Travolta's ever being taken seriously again by Hollywood or by anyone seriously interested in the cinema industry."

Well, it turns out it's as bad as they say, and it's not even interesting enough to be hilariously bad. It's just bad.

Where to start? The dialog is dumb, the effects are pretty bad (by and large), the plot is about what you'd expect, and the entire thing is roughly the equivalent of smearing dog feces onto film and putting it through a projector.

People often neglect to mention costumes in a movie, and not being a costume person I suppose I do the same, normally. But the costumes in this case deserve special attention. Were they bad? Let's put it this way: To call them worse than wearing a gown made from frozen puke would be demeaning to frozen puke. You know those shoes that the Spice Girls wore about 10 years ago with really tall soles? That's what John Travolta and Forrest Whitaker wore the entire movie. Plus they have things that look like boogers hanging from their nose the entire time, and hair that Medusa herself wouldn't be caught dead in. And so on. Look at the pictures and you'll see what I mean.

And if you think that it's inappropriate to include the word ""boogers"" in a serious movie review, you obviously don't realize how bad of a movie we're talking about."
1117,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"Let me summarize this one...

Borderline retarded cone-head aliens (with Ozzy Osborne's hair and unibrows that extend to the ear) teleport down to earth and take over the planet.

""Why?"" you ask? Gold! No evil unibrow alien society would be complete without a Mr. T starter kit! Fortunately for mankind, in the year 3,000 a group of GEICO cavemen guys cook up a plan that involves thousand year old fighter jets, nuclear weapons and M-16 rifles...

The story is so ridiculous that it actually shows in the acting. Decent actors like John Travolta and Forrest Whitaker looked like they belong in low-budget TV commercials...obviously because they couldn't get into the script.

I honestly don't think a studio could make a movie suck this bad if they actually tried to make it suck...it's just one of those rare instances where everything fell apart. This was literally the worst movie I can remember seeing."
1118,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"I would like to say that this film is extremely underrated. The flaws with the film have been grossly exaggerated in all criticisms that I've read. It is however true that there are major flaws with the film: The cinematography is distracting and made it hard at times to even figure out what was going on in the picture. The filming crew took some risks that in this case didn't work at all or might have given that they were done minimally. The slanted angle shots, slow motion sequences, choice of dominant coloring, and other cinematographic oddities became tired after about 30 minutes into the movie. - 2/10

The script was an attempt to cram a novel into a movie. It was lacking and at times confusing, referencing things that only a person who had read the book would understand. Repeting words and phrases was a little annoying. However, it was a consistent style that helped to develop the characters. - 4/10

The acting was acceptable, given the script. The only main annoyance is that the accents were inconsistent. Travolta and all other supporting actors did a fine job. They were believable and into their characters. - 7/10

The music was right on. The composer was over the top, but the composer was writing a score for a movie where the cinematography was over the top. So, I do not think that the composer should be faulted for writing the most appropriate score for the movie he was assigned to. - 10/10

The story was compelling, but left more to be desired. Perhaps this was because it was a movie based on a book and the book would explain more. - 8/10

Inconsistencies, impossible situations, and continuity error was all over the place. - 1/10"
1119,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"If you watch this movie as a comedy instead of an an action movie this is one of the funniest movies of all time. With classic quotes from John Travolta such as the constant use of the word ""man animals"", and (in reference to the gold) ""You smelted it into bar form"". Then there is the high quality acting from the ""man-animals"", the grunting and monkey like movements make for some quality comedic acting. The setting only helps the comedy, I laugh whenever I remind myself that the year is 3000 and yet our weapons from 1000 years earlier are in tact and ready to use. Then not only are our out dated weapons ready to use but they can apparently do now what they failed to do 1000 years earlier which is destroy the alien planet. What a great idea; in my opinion this passes ""There's Something about Mary"" as the funniest movie sequence of all time.

1122,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"Religion is a dangerous thing. It has started many major wars and is the cause of millions of deaths throughout human history. But whether or not you're Christian, Muslim or Hindu, you know that one religion is more dangerous than any other: Scientology. Because no other religion in the history of mankind has spawned a movie as abysmally awful as the majestic super-turkey Battlefield Earth.

The plot, if there was one, concerns a group of very ugly and expendable people locked up somewhere 1000 years after an alien race called 'Psychlos' (which is a combination of 'psychos' and the 'L' in L. Ron Hubbard) has destroyed civilization as we know it (kind of like Janet Jackson at the Superbowl). Also, the aliens are people with contact lenses, big heads and dreadlocks. Um... Yeah. That about sums it up. There's also a ""hero"", played (?) by Barry Pepper, an ugly old priest-something to whom the sixties weren't too good, and a dumb-as-a-brick girlfriend who has nothing to do but mope.

John Travolta camps around with awful lines, laughing like an idiot, possibly in a state of suppressed panic as he slowly starts to realize that he's possibly not doing his pal L. Ron Hubbard a favor by starring in this film. The technical and factual flaws are too many to list and so obvious it's like the makers were joking. If that is the case, hardy f-ing har, big laughs! The goofs range from minor nuisances like the fact that Travolta's character speaks English when he's supposedly speaking Psychlon, to miles-wide plot holes like how the Harriers can still run after 1000 years, or how unprotected books are still intact.

So, the cringe-worthy performances and holes you could put Peter Harryson's butt through aside, can Battlefield Earth at least count as ""silly fun""? Why, of course not! Every skewed shot, every mindless scene of this movie seems intent on making the viewing experience as unpleasant for the viewer as possible. If they're not out of focus, the shots are likely to be ruined by one-colour filters, but what can you really expect when the director is doped up all throughout shooting? Barry Pepper is so bad as the supposed ""hero"" the makers could just as well have slapped a Cheney mask on a traffic light and called it acting. The only reason I even remember the name of his non-character is because it is so offensively stupid (how lame is 'Johnny Goodboy', seriously?!)

Possibly the worst offence (from a technical standpoint, that is) has to be the Dutch Angle -- normally used sparingly to ""throw off"" the viewer's perspective to create feelings of unease and/or discomfort, but in Battlefield Earth is literally the only shot used.

Can someone please tell me how the human weapons still worked after all this time? Where did the electricity for the flight simulator come from? What was up with the tilted angle? Why the obvious rip-off from Blade Runner in the first chase scene? Why was this movie made? Why did I pay to go see it? These are questions that will never be answered.

I mean ok if you like this great, I pity you and question your tastes, but why do people who love something feel they have to back it up by saying they did it 3 times? Once means tried maybe? A Second means it was neat I'll do it again? So three must mean HARDCORE!!! WOOOOOOOWHEE! Well whatever reasoning, I have never known pain like this pain. My friend and I winced at Mission to Mars (M2M for you clever trendy folk) so the wincing was increased ten fold during Battlefield Earth. Hey that could be BFE! I've been to BFE, my friend lived in BFE, it took 40 minutes to get there. It was a bad movie. BAD, I didn't ""See myself"" I didn't ""relate"" I couldn't even grasp the campiness or cheese factor (and i love camp and cheese)I mean sure I disagree with critics, and sure I can justify defending a movie that was ""misunderstood"" by the general populace. I just really sat there and thought, ""Why?"". I will say this, I was also a bit angry that it did suck so bad. The concept of enslaved fyootcher humans looking at 1000 year old earth stuff is neat, but this one failed.

1137,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"Okay, everyone has seen review after review pointing out the utter idiocy that is Battlefield Earth. I must reiterate, however, to drive home the point: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Or, if you must, buy a ticket for an actually worthy movie and theater hop, don't reward the people who put out this wretched abomination with your money. I was a fortunate one, one of my friends paid for the ticket, not me. And if he thinks he's ever getting his money from me, he's got another thing coming. However, I will never get back the precious, wasted hours of my life. Save yourselves! At many points, I must wonder whether the script was in fact the fault of Hubbard or a five-year old child. One or the other thought that it would be really cool to have a bunch of stone-using tribesmen zoom around in Harriers. But wait, not only are the tribesmen able to restore thousand-year-old fighters, fuel and arm them in a magical military base that still has power after those thousand years, they can also talk to each other without any headsets or other radio equipment while flying around! Psychic tribesmen! Who, after that thousand years, know phrases like, ""Piece of cake"" and, ""I'm on his tail"".

But even if the screenplay was written by this hypothetical child, Hubbard is still responsible for the ""hero"", Johnny Goodboy. Who the hell names a character Johnny Goodboy? And why does he have no personality at all? I mean, none! He strives to emulate Braveheart with little, failed attempts at rousing speeches, but they come across as flat and pathetic as the rest of the acting. The Psyclos aren't nearly as intimidating as they should be, just how much can the audience fear an ultimate enemy that you could defeat with an egg in a jar with an opening too small to fit their fist through? On top of that, they still manage to trust the Terl guy despite the fact that he goes out of his way to screw over everyone he passes by. You could easily cause a Psyclo to have a seizure just by asking, ""No means yes and yes means no, do you want me to hit you?""

In any event, if you think that a galvanic skin tester can cure your spiritual ills and that giving $400,000 to become an Operant Theta VIII is a good idea, then run to see this movie! If you are not yet in the clutches of Hubbard's happy family, then avoid it at all costs. I'm convinced it's a Scientology plot to numb the brains of the viewers so much that their warped technobabble makes sense in comparison."

1141,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"I can't believe what i am reading in these comments.

This was absolutely the worst ""Blockbuster"" movie I have ever seen. I would rather watch Waterworld three times. The holes in the plot are plenty. For example, the cavemen dogfighting with the alien pilots. The special effects have a rush job feel to them. For example, the shot at night of the alien homeworld, with the teleportation pads and the little lights flashing behind them. The badguy was submoronic. Why let the slaves fly around with a spaceship that doesnt have a homeing device on it to track them with.

The plot is terrible. The badguy aliens are here to strip mine the earth of its valuables. Why not look in all the banks and national reserves before you start mining? Why not build a cost effective robot to do your digging for you? Your technology obviously could support it. At least the robots wouldnt need guards to watch over them.

Thats right. It all has something to do with radioactive zones. Ones that humans live in? and procreate in?

This movie, with its obvious 50's anti-violence motif(they pan to reaction shots during the true brutality), shows me that we might be soon taking backward steps in our media future.

What i don't understand is why this film rates 3 out of 10, but a majority of the comments are glowing?

So you people who want to waste your money on poor films, go see this one. Twice if you want to, I will never watch this film again. I will shut off the T.V. before I watch this."
1142,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"I was very, very intoxicated for my viewing of this special, special movie, and let me tell you, this is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.

A hysterical, rollicking performance by John Travolta as a combo Rob Zombie-Klingon ""Psychlo"" (HILARIOUS!) is at the root of what makes this movie worthwhile. Some day, in the future, once Travolta leaves the Church of Scientology and they do a made for TV movie about his life, there'll be an incredible scene where the actor playing him is dressed up in the horrible Psychlo costume. The camera will slowly zoom in to Travolta's face as a small tear develops in his left eye, as he realizes how utterly humiliating his performance - and the movie in general - is. Then the TV network will cut to a commercial.

But never mind that now. What you need to know as a movie viewer is that this movie is worth watching in the same way the Beastmaster, Warlock, Death Race 2000, or Yor is worth watching. Being incredibly wasted, as I say, helps.

And then when you get home, no need for the fun to subside! You can log onto IMDB and pick out the clams from the USER COMMENTS section - the use of the terms ""ironic humor"" - or variations on that, as well as the utterly absurd comparison to Star Wars will mark likely poor little snappin' clams.

This movie is not, as some reports would indicate, too bad to find funny. Perhaps if you spent the full ticket price, you might walk out a little bit annoyed but if you go in there expecting crap, you can have a really good time watching this film.

And if you don't catch it on this go around, no need to bother renting it - it'll be on USA Up All Night in a few years - or some equivalent show.

Hysterical. Utterly hysterical."

I am such a die-hard sci-fi fan that it is completely out of character but after wasting 2 hours of my life viewing Battlefield Earth, I felt compelled to spread the word. Battlefield Earth is an incredibly awful movie.

It was a bad mix of ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" meets ""Planet of the Apes"" meets ""Independence Day"". Where else could ""man animals"" fly harrier jets in combat with less than a weeks preparation....in addition, those old flying relics were over 1000 years old and managed to fly???

1145,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"I believe in tolerance for other people's beliefs and I hate religious bigotry, so I couldn't help but think of Travolta's connection to Scientology while watching this film. This film had a definite spiritual effect on me and made me contemplate my own Christian faith. It made me think back to the stories of my Sunday school. Particularly the story of Stephen. I thought that Travolta was very much like a modern-day Stephen. The first Christian martyr who was only a generation removed from the life of Christ who, inspired by what he considered divine teachings, went out to spread the word and suffered his tribulations at the hands of an ignorant few. Some might assume that I felt empathy for Travolta as I drew such parallels. Actually, I was just thinking ""I've wasted $6.50 on this piece of crap"" and CAN WE BRING BACK STON"

1148,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"...not because Travolta is in dreds, not because of the alleged scientology subliminal messages, but because it is one of the worst movies ever made.

I do not use that term lightly. I consider myself a lover of bad movies, movies that can be enjoyed for their lack of success. ""Battlefield Earth"" goes well beyond that into the realm of slow torturous pain.

I saw this movie because I expected it to be bad, and even I was shocked at how bad it was. Just plain bad. In nearly every respect.

I suppose I should note that the ear-bleeding sound effects sounded pretty realistic. And they were loud. So the guy who did the sound shouldn't be ashamed. Everyone else that worked on this movie, bow your heads.

Director Roger Christian has put together one of the worst movies sci-fi or otherwise that I have seen. Loaded with uninteresting characters, a dumb plot, ridiculous gaping holes in logic, terrible direction, only so-so special effects, and a huge length for a movie this bad (over two hours), ""Battlefield Earth"" is already being compared to ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."" In my book, it's a fair comparison.

Take the direction. Sure Ed Wood had no clue what he was doing, but at least he pointed the camera directly at the actors when they talked. Christian decides he's going to be original and tilt the camera at least 45 degrees everytime someone says anything. The whole movie I was tilting my head side to side, trying to keep up.

The effects, well ""Plan 9"" had pie tins in strings. ""Battlefield Earth"" has a couple of nifty CGI effects, but the final length battle sequence is filmed in a very dark blue setting, rendering it impossible to see who is shooting who at any given moment. Of course, even if I had known it wouldn't have made much of a difference because I really didn't care about any of the characters one way or another.

Gaping continuity? Well, ""Plan 9"" had scenes in cars that began in the day, then turned to night when people got out of the cars. In ""Battlefield Earth"", the Psychlos can discover gold veins in difficult to reach mountains, but somehow totally miss out on Fort Knox, still completely stocked with gold 1,000 years in the future. Cavemen learn not only to speak and work together, but operate Harrier jets within a week. How did they learn you ask? Well on a Harrier jet flight simulator of course, somehow still working on electricity 1,000 years in the future. More? The cavemen communicate with walkie-talkies in the final battle. How do they still work? They found fresh batteries? Next Duracels I see, they better say ""Best if used before 3005.""

Is ""Battlefield Earth"" worse than ""Plan 9""? I'd have to say yes. ""Plan 9"" is so cheesy and goofy you have to laugh. Just fun to watch. After about an hour of ""Earth"" I wanted to hurt someone. After two hours and it was still going, I wanted to hurt myself. Avoid, even for lovers of dumb movies."

1150,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"Battlefield: EARTH is pure dreck. A sloppy, poorly thought out, ridiculously written disaster that rivals any previous Hollywood bomb in history. The movie makes little sense, has plotholes so glaring that only an infant could ignore them. The direction, acting, even the music is banal and boring and not even fun to laugh at. The consensus of critics is that this movie is awful and they're absolutely right. DO NOT waste your money on this whether in theaters or on video.

You'll spend your time scratching your head and saying, ""What?"" and ""Excuse me?"" a lot as the film makers ignore logic and any intelligent thought to tell a completely ridiculous storyline. I never read the book and won't now for sure. The only people who could truly enjoy this film are ones who indulge in illegal substances before going to the movies.

As one reviewer said, the aliens on the Simpsons, Kodos and Kang seem to be the main inspiration for Travolta's character Terl. He overplays him as a complete idiot who hands victory to the hero on a silver platter. He's supposed to be the Head of Security for the Psyclo's on Earth but isn't bright enough to be Mr. Magoo. If they'd advertised this as HISTORY OF THE WORLD: YEAR 3000, they would have been more accurate and probably made more money than this stupid waste of film. If you must see it, buy tickets for another movie and sneak into B:E rather than pay any money to fools like the ones who made this mess.

1151,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"""Battlefield Earth"" (2000), if there ever was a disease reincarnated as a ""movie"", then this is a perfect example of one. To be honest, I have never seen this ""film"" before in my life, but I have heard things about it, and have never had the desire to check it out. It just happened to be on TV last night, so I decided to watch it. I thought: ""you know what, I like science fiction/action movies. I'm going to give this a watch, how bad can it possibly be?"" Well, it honestly wasn't as bad as I thought. No, it was a million times worse! What in the world did I just watch?! The story, or lack thereof, is nothing short of a joke. The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen, the special effects are horrible, the sets/locations are abysmal, and the soundtrack is cliched and generic. Believe it or not, this ""movie"" is based off a novel by author L. Ron Hubbard. I have never read the novel, but I'm sure that it's probably much more entertaining than this pile of filth of a ""film""! Originally, ""Battlefield Earth"" was to be a part 1 of a 2 part movie series. The original book it's based off of is 1,050 pages in length, and this ""film"" only covers the first 436 pages of the story. Can't imagine how bad the sequel would have been if it was ever produced! But thankfully, it was cancelled. This ""movie"" should have never been made to begin with! There is barely any story, it's basically like the diarrhea stain known as ""Diner"" (1982), nothing but subplots that go absolutely nowhere and don't add up! It's a crying shame, because the story concept seems interesting and has a lot of potential. But it was just executed so terribly, so terrible that it should be illegal! The acting is also a total disgrace, from all of the actors subjected to being in this ""movie""! I have never seen acting so over the top, yet so cringeworthy and yet so boring in my life. I was surprised to see an actor like John Travolta in this ""film"". When I saw him on the poster, I thought: ""I like John Travolta as an actor. Maybe he can make this movie worth watching?"" But no, he actually plays one of the aliens, known as Psychlos. No really, they are actually called Psychlos. Come on, a preschooler could have come up with a more intimidating name than that! We'll get to talking more about those aliens in a second. The special effects are nothing short of horrible, I've seen better effects on old video games! Even the sound effects are cheap and generic. Like an old cheesy arcade game! Also, the makeup for the aliens in this ""movie"" is some of the worst I have ever seen. They just look like humans with Jamaican wigs and nose piercings. They must be inspired by the villain Screwface from ""Marked For Death"" (1990)! Honestly, I've seen children's Halloween costumes that look more realistic! Some human beings actually look more like aliens than the so-called ""aliens"" in this ""movie"". Let that sink in for a moment! The sets/locations look like they were edited together by a first year student in film school. Also, the cinematography is some of the worst I have ever seen. If you look at any scene from this ""movie"", you'll notice that most of the shots are at an angle. What? Was KidBehindACamera the cinematographer? Yes, I know that they were trying to shoot this ""film"" to look like a comic book. But it just makes it look like the camera operators were drunk! Seriously, over 90% of the shots are slanted. It looks like the ""movie"" is sinking! Although, to be honest it was sinking before it was ever made. If you have the courage to watch it, be prepared for a sore neck! Also, the soundtrack is awful, but I suppose that this diarrhea dump of a ""movie"" would be incomplete without a terrible soundtrack. This ""movie"" should have never been made, it's a crime to film making. I've seen many movies in my life, and this one is the worst ""movie"" I have ever seen, so far. I rate this ""movie"" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. If I could rate it 0 IMDB stars I would, but 1 is as low as I can go. Ignore the 1 star rating on IMDB, my true rating is 0 stars. For all you're worth, stay away from this sorry excuse of film making. To all actors and film makers sadly involved with this ""movie"", all I have to say is, I'm sorry. We can all be thankful that this ""film"" didn't ruin your careers!"

BOMB (out of 4)

I hate bandwagons but I must admit that I'm jumping on one here. Incredibly bad movie set in the future where humans are pretty much an endangered species. They've been murdered off by the evil Psychlos but one human (Barry Pepper) decides to venture out of his safe zone and he's kidnapped by Terl (John Travolta), which sets a new chain of events into motion. BATTLEFIELD EARTH is every bit as bad as you've heard and in many ways it's actually much worse than its reputation. One really has to wonder what on Earth anyone involved in this thing was thinking. The original novel by L. Ron Hubbard is a piece of work I've never read so I can't say whether or not it's bad and they just made a bad movie out of it or perhaps it's good and this movie just messed it up. The biggest problem with this film (and there are many) is the fact that there's no a single second of screen time where you actually care or are interested in what's going on. The entire movie just seems so pointless as you never care for any of the characters, you don't care what happens as the plot moves along and you certainly don't care about anything happening. It's really shocking that a movie from Hollywood could be made without you at least feeling for one single character. Even worse is the dialogue, which is just so bad that most people will be wondering if perhaps the entire film was some sort of bad joke. The performances aren't any better, although out of everyone Pepper comes off the best. Forrest Whitaker isn't horrid but it's rather embarrassing seeing someone with his talent here. The real horrid performance comes from Travolta. Geez, what can be said about him? The performance and character are among the worst you're going to see in the genre and I guess the less said the better. The entire film has a very ugly look to it. The visuals are bad, the cinematography poor and even the music score makes you want to blow your ear drums out. BATTLEFIELD EARTH is a complete waste of time and the 117-minute running time just drags by. However, if it wasn't for all the slow motion this thing might have clocked in at under 90-minutes."
1165,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"This is sucking up to the keepers of your religion at its worst. Starting with any of the drivel written by Hubbard is always a bad move. Going on to turn a meaningless, poorly written book into a flaccid screenplay with dialog that sounds like it was written by a schizophrenic adds up to strike two. Turning that screenplay into one of the most derivative, idiotic movies of the decade just retires the side in the bottom of the ninth. Hit the showers losers, it's time to load up the short bus and head back to Clearwater. Is everyone in the cast a saintliest or did Travolta resort to blackmail and bribery to get a cast for this third rate copy of any science fiction movie made in the eighties? Of course, if they were actually meaning to make something so preposterous that it's laughable, I owe someone an apology. Don't go to it. Don't rent it.

The B movie Sci-Fi films from the 50's (screaming teenagers, terrible dialog, hokey aliens or monsters, lots of fake blood) look like the ""Godfather"" or ""Citizen Kane"" compared to this turkey. I won't give away the plot -- there's not much to give away.

Sadly, there are a couple of good actors, but they seem to have been caught up in the Scientology aspects of the film rather than making a good movie or even one that makes the slightest amount of sense. The ones that are well know will put this behind them and try very hard to forget about it. If only the audience was so lucky.

In closing, let's just say that you should spend your money and/or time on virtually any other SF film or book or just go for a walk or take a nap -- it will be a far better use of your time."

1168,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"I was just joking about the title, I did that to get your attention, this movie was god awful. Words cannot describe how bad this movie was. Everyone should watch this movie just so they can laugh themselves to death. However, we need to find a way to circulate this movie to the entire world population without any of the money going to whoever directed this. I was blown away by the total crappiness in all aspects. Watching the acting in this movie lowered my I.Q. significantly. There were so many continuity errors and plot sequences that made no sense that I lost all contact with reality. Did I mention that the acting was terrible. Unbelievable. How did it cost 70 million dollars to make this movie? Why was the camera tilted the whole time? Why is the whole movie in slow motion. Why doesn't anything make any sen"
1169,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"I agree completely that this is one of the worst films imaginable: both with the over 20,000 people who rated it so low, numerically; and with the bulk of the verbal reviews that try to warn others away from it.

However, I do not think that the lead or supporting actors are to blame. I suspect the formerly Oscar-winning director should also take less blame than the public assigns to him, for this filmic atrocity.

Even though I only bought a (used) DVD of this film so I could study a number of films on IMDb's ""Bottom 100"" list, to see what I could learn from films that tens of thousands of people hate ... I still want my two hours back. Stunningly, unbelievably, ""mouth hanging open in shock"" bad! This is the sort of film that you have to watch two really good films immediately afterwards, to counter the emotional assault. And it still leaves a bad taste in your mind, after that.

The sheer beginning-to-end consistency of the film lets many of those who have taken the blame in other reviews -- actors, director, etc. -- off of the hook, in my opinion. Here's what I mean: take 100 people off of the street, totally at random. One at a time, give them some lines of bad dialogue to read, out loud. Tape the results, and study how each of those persons delivers those bad lines. What are the odds that all 100 random people would give the exact same STYLE of line reading? Same speed of delivery; same tone; same, same, same, every time. What are the odds they'd all sound stupid, in the exact same way? The odds are probably better that you'll win the Lottery (without buying any tickets) and get hit by part of a visiting comet, in the same day. The fact that all the actors in this thing look and sound like perfect clones of one another is beyond highly suspicious, in my opinion. It tells me to look elsewhere, to assign due blame properly.

Take that thought experiment a step farther. Take a quality actor like Forest Whitaker, and recalculate the odds. Here's a person whose past body of work clearly shows that they are more than capable of a wealth of fine, subtly nuanced, always entertaining, sometimes simply wonderful performances. A person who gave decades to study and practice, so that you completely buy into the illusion that this actor is who he or she is pretending to be, within the context of a given story. Or Barry Pepper  ""Saving Private Ryan"" alone, in my mind, shows that he can act very well; and hold a viewer's attention; and make that viewer care about the character that he's portraying.

What are the realistic odds that several trained actors with excellent prior credits, would all act in the EXACT same way? Specifically, that they would all look and sound like a parody of a mentally challenged person who was told to make fun of really, really bad actors. No way! It's beyond any statistical probability. It's simply not possible.

Someone with a lot of power -- more power than any director, I'd suspect -- had to be treating this group of actors like mere puppets: telling them what to do; when to do it; and exactly how to do it. A classic case of micro-management, followed by blaming the victims -- who always knew better, but were not allowed to disobey their orders.

This person or persons had to be pulling everyone's strings, from just outside of the camera's field of view. I say that because I've been on over fifty sets, as an Extra -- the ideal ""fly on the wall"" situation, for seeing what REALLY happens on movie sets. What I saw, in a lot more cases than the bulk of the public would ever think was possible or likely, was the director or producer simply over-ruling an actor's acting decisions. In too many cases, quite rudely telling them ""No, no; that's wrong: do it this way"" and then demonstrating. I'm talking big stars here, as well as highly respected character actors. It happens.

Having seen directors do that, as if it were their sole prerogative, I have to wonder how much influence the financiers had, here? If a person coughs up several million dollars, out of their own pocket, they are going to want creative control. And they'll get it. It's a given; or the film won't get made. I think that's the real problem at work here.

In summary: I think this film is an incredibly rare example of ""studio interference"" -- without a studio really being involved. I'm sorry the actors, directors and others took the blame for the final product. I'm sure they expected a lot more creative freedom than they got. I hope their careers will recover. In the end, I'm marginally glad that I studied this bad film  if only to have a clear warning of unusual dangers related to the creative funding of films no one is in any hurry to make. However, that doesn't mean you should ever watch this film. Do yourself a favor: run away!"
1170,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"The movie itself is not that bad. Yes it contains a lot of mistakes. Yes the acting is sub-par. Yes it could have been better. But if you watch the movie for the sole purpose of entertainment it will serve that purpose. Granted you won't walk away with the feeling of awe and amazement such as you would with a movie like Gladiator or Saving Private Ryan, but you may get a few laughs. On a side note our hero is the same actor that plays the sniper in Saving Private Ryan. John Travolta plays a decent villain. Maybe its just me but I thought Battlefield Earth was pretty decent. I am actually disappointed they did not make a sequel of the movie. My recommendation is to keep expectations low this way when you see the movie you won't be disappoint"

1172,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"Ah, it is truly amazing to see that there are movies out there this horrible. Possibly the only thing more depressing then watching a movie this bad is thinking about the money wasted on such an endeavor and the fact that it was put in theaters despite its absolute horribleness. So long as movies like this make it to theater no one can ever say to me, ""Burning movies is bad,"" this kind of film makes me wish Hollywood was not in business.

Now on to the main event. What was good? Um did you read above? Or see my rating? NOTHING IS GOOD. There are moments when I wonder if a movie worse then this is possible (Yes I have seen plan nine from outer space and let me tell you, that's got nothing on this.)

What was bad? Well let me count the ways. 1) bad acting, horrible acting, stone flat acting that makes you want to cry, sad and pathetic acting worse (That's right worse) then you see in daytime television or made for TV movies. 2) BAD ACTION, possibly the only thing one might have expected out of this film was a little action, some killing, possibly a few explosions. While there are explosions and futuristic guns, this is not a cool sci-fi flick. Think horrible camera work, no sense of timing, and no sense at all, watching grass grow gives one a better sense of satisfaction then watching an action scene from this HORRIBLE MOVIE. 3) You know what, I am done there, if I put one more word down about how bad it is I will go nuts, simple don't see it, ever, it's not worth it."

These untrained humans defeat the aliens in just a couple of days, because they now have a leader. Their ships can be defeated with just a heat seaking missile! How could they have won?

The aliens look quite human. Oh yes, of course they've got 6 fingers on each hand... and they are a bit taller. One of the other conquered races, well, that one looks a bit more alien, like not so much resembling human.

How was this piece of trash made? The lead actor in this thing (I think `thing' is far more appropriate than `movie') was unfathomably bad. Even the editing -- most notably the annoying iris-out transitions -- was hurriedness. I do recommend, however, that everyone see this movie; it is worth a good laugh. In short, when you mix bad acting, bad writing, bad story, bad

direction, bad score, and special effects that look as if they were created by a 3- year-old playing with iMovie, the result is a movie that proves that there is no limit to how bad a movie can possibly be. (0/1"

1176,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"This movie is so bad, it defies description.

The experience starts with the back of the movie box which extols the virtues of Battlefield Earth. These include, but are not limited to, ""An entirely new style of science fiction film-making"", ""Good scene transitions"", and (my personal favorite), action that will leave you ""exhausted"". Sadly, the box said nothing about inane dialogue, ineffably awful acting, and a plot that has so many holes in it, it could be used to strain spaghetti. In my opinion, before watching this movie, you must check the logic centre of your brain at the door, lest it shut down permanently from the strain of trying to make sense of the fact that a highly technologically advanced alien species was still unable to discover Fort Knox.

If you want a fun drinking game (and I firmly believe that generous quantities of alcohol can only improve the viewing experience) take a drink/shot every time a Psychlon says the phrase ""Man-Animals"", and every time you catch a glimpse of John Travolta's and Forrest Whitakker's grotesquely over-sized...uh...packages.

Speaking of Forrest Whitakker, the man is an Oscar winner. Did he not know what he was getting himself into? Why did he stay once he realized what was going on around him. Some of his dialogue seems like a cry for help. It's unfortunate that his career had to suffer through this movie, although maybe it's just as well that he got it out of the way early. Unlike John Travolta.

Improbably, Travolta is worse in Battlefield Earth than he was in Broken Arrow. The man puts in the performance of a lifetime, an awful performance in what he must have known was an awful movie.

I have run out of words. If you really must watch this movie, watch it with a group of people with whom you can mercilessly tear it to shreds. At least you'll get some enjoyment out of it that way. I still have not mentioned the forgettable score, bad editing, and terrible cinematography which seems to live in mortal fear of any shots that occur at a completely vertical angle. Now I have.

1183,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"I expected a real donkey, either cheesy sci-fi pap with no plot or a boring self indulgent epic because of the terrible reviews but from the start of the film I found myself pleasently suprised, it turned out to be a thoughtful and interesting film

I have always been interested in cavemen and how they must have viewed the world. In BE the few surviving humans have regressed into a primitive society with no technology or education and the film spends some time with them, seeing how they live and see life. Fascinating

I tend to dislike sci-fi films carried by special effects only and thankfully BE doesn't fall into this category. What makes it different is that instead of having an intracate plot embelished with strange future technology it basically revolves around the physcology of being imprisoned and enslaved which is unusual

A lot of time is spent dealing with the humans responses to technology and advanced concepts, while we also see the aliens are not just 'evil' stereotypes - they just think the humans are animals and treat them as such

There are also no massive battle scenes, and for a sci-fi film a lot of hand to hand combat. All this made me even more impressed and like most good films, the hero's really have to fight hard to win and they do in BE too, there is a sense of satisfaction when they start learning to outsmart their captors

I liked the sound track which was atmospheric and there seemed to be a lot of repetitive music played quietly in the background throughout most of the film - this is actually quite unnerving and I enjoyed this unusual effect

The only points of criticism I have are the concept of the aliens being after gold, the sillyness of flying 1000 year old Harrier jets, and the computerised 'education' scene where the hero ends up explaining geometry and physics to his cavemen brethren!

The gold didn't bother me THAT much, after all its a resource of the earth and it's very believable aliens would invade our planet for its rich resources As for one or two 'silly' scenes well, they only last a few minutes its not a big deal

So I don't understand the critical attacks to BE. I can only assume people don't like Travolta for some reason (ok, he's an easy target with the scientology), or were expecting lots of effects and action This is not Starship troopers (which bored me senseless)!

Ultimately I think the film was marketed wrong, it should have been an underground film aimed at the alternative sci-fi market. Its just not a mainstream film

I think there a quiet a few people out there who would also be pleasently suprised like me!"

I didn't know anything about it, & rented it on a whim. It is terrible. It is so bad, there are few words that can describe it. To anyone who liked this movie, even moderately, I say this: this movie is filled with plot holes & shoddy film making, to an unbelievable extent. Please think about what you are watching. This movie cost over $70,000,000 & it grossed $21,000,000. I know box office results are petty & a poor indicator of a good movie, because some of the best movies ever made have been unsuccessful in their own times, but this movie was unsuccessful because it just plain sucks! This is one instance when the mass movie going public is correct. It didn't make much money because it is a very poorly made movie. If you haven't seen it, go watch it, & actually think about what you are watching. There are a lot of terrible movies out there, & many of them cost a lot of money, but this movie fails on every single principle of film making. The acting, the writing, the directing, the sfx, the camera work, you name it. I'm all for movies that are mindless & entertaining, even stupid at times. But this movie is bad because it was pretending to actually be smart. It was a vanity project that was trying to make a point, but instead just makes a mess of itself."
1193,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"As stated by, well, pretty much everybody without a vested interest, this is a pretty horrible movie. Unlike some people I don't even find it's badness funny. Perhaps it's greatest fault is it's boring and unoriginal. If you want to see a good movie with more-or-less the same plot, watch ""Independence Day.""

On the other hand I'd like to point out some of the films strengths, without implying that they mitigate this travesty in any way. Forrest Whitaker is actually pretty good in his role (which would have been a larger role in the sequel.) There were also some decent performances among the supporting cast of humans and Psychlos. People just tend to forget them because the two principals were so awful.

Barry Pepper is probably the worst. I've seen high school kid productions with dad's video camera that contained better performances. The guy simply has no charisma or screen presence. He should go back to bad Sci-Fi channel movies, or wherever he came from.

But let me be an apologist for John Travolta. Granted he wasn't very good in this, but he did try to appropriately channel the character from the book. Terel literally is supposed to be on the verge of psychosis, as well as being deviously intelligent and delusional. In a lot of ways Travolta pulls this off.

The unfortunate thing is he didn't have much to work with. The true stinker of this film is it's awful script. Perhaps the worst in the last 30 years. The dialog is painful at best and uninspired. It revolves around colloquialisms and cliché's that the worst hack writer wouldn't touch, and nothing that comes out of any characters lips is believable. They don't even manage to follow some of the more interesting plot points of the book, settling for spectacle and silliness like resurrecting a fleet of AV-8B Harriers. (For my part, I think the Uranium tipped bullets from the book would have been cooler; causing the Psychlo's to explode on impact!)

Perhaps the most telling comparison that can be made is that with L. Ron Hubbard's novel. The book is not good, but it is entertaining. The movie is neither.

The special effects appear to be high-budget Star Wars like effects (I know, I'm cursed for even using the title ""Star Wars"" in a review for ""Battlefield Earth""), but the plot, the acting, everything was just so horribly bad, the movie is basically a joke. When I told a friend that 'Mars Attacks' was the worst movie ever, she said 'No way, check out Battlefield Earth'. I did, and she was right. Travolta, playing as an alien villain brute? Terrible. The rest of the acting, let's not even go there. The plot, there pretty much was none. Psychlo? That was the name of the planet! Who wrote this movie anyway? I'm surprised that Travolta still has a career after this one. In short, this movie can be compared to something a 1st grader would come up with if he wrote, directed, and produced a 100 million dollar budget movie. I'm not entirely sure why this idea ever even got on paper, never mind the big screen. If you want a good laugh, pick this one up instead of a comedy.

1196,Battlefield Earth (2000),2.5,Roger Christian,"This movie gets one star, for managing to be entertaining for the first 10 minutes.

Somewhere in this debacle is a rollicking Sci-fi action movie that Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise might have been able to tease out of the big silly novel on which the movie is based. Unfortunately, John Travolta was the Scientologist involved this project.

The movie is set in the year 3,000. Earth has been ravaged by the Psyhclos, an evil ailen race, that is from the planet Psychlo, itself subject to periodic Psychlones and attended by Pscyhlologists and Psychliatrists. (OK I made the the last three up, but the movie is about that subtle. The Psychlos are psycho! Get it?) The human race has been virtually wiped out. Those left either work mining gold for the Psychlos or hide out in caves. Johnny Goodboy Tyler (Yes, that is his name) wanders out of his cave and into the mall-like structure that it is the Psychlo mining operation. He is enslaved, and after a series of ludicrious, poorly lit scenes, ends up leading a rebellion against the Psychlos and freeing the earth.

Johnny's dreary, uninteresting story benefits from being inter spliced with the wild overacting, goofy make-up, and awful special effects in the scenes with Psychlos. John Travolta is a hoot as Frankie Badguy, I mean Terl, the 9-foot head of security for the Psychlo mining operation. He looks kind of like Gene Simmons in his KISS make-up and recently deceased. If Travolta didn't have a track record of appearing in garbage and of being a Scientologist, I'd give him a little props for his awful, funny performance.

The special effects in this movie deserve especial derision. The teleport device that the Psychlos use to travel is actually cheesier than the one used in the original Star Trek, made 40 years ago, mind you.

The cities are obviously matte paintings (lit poorly to hide the fact), and too often, the movie mismanages the forced perspective scenes involving the 9-foot Psychlos and the humans so that the height difference isn't accurately represented. The camera is either really really close to one of the Psychlos to make him look big, or the actors are obviously walking on stilts.

The shot of the Psychlo home planet: You have to see it for yourself. Really not much better than the Mystery Science Theater 3000 planet. I've never seen a worse special effect in a motion picture in major release.

Speaking of camera-work, most of the shots in this film are tilted so that the scene resembles a comic book panel. Though interesting at first, this technique begins to induce nausea.

The color palette, too--green, purple, black--is ugly and jarring.

In the end, Battlefield Earth approaches the so-bad-it's-good threshold but the filmmakers treat the material seriously enough to help it remain on the bad side. Only of value as a how not to make a movie guide."

To finish this off: The acting is atrocious, the butt-rock scattered through the soundtrack will make you want to punch the guy running the theater in the face, and the story is basically the manga's, but cut up, put into a blender, stuffed into sausage skins, and stitched back together with an American flag tied around it.

If you want your Dragonball fix, just buy dvds of the show instead, skip the movie, and if you don't skip it, then at least don't pay for this thing. I heard that a sequel is already in the works, and we don't need a trilogy, that would be three of these movies too many."
1201,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"Watching DBE i can immediately tell the directors and everyone else involved have not watched more than a few episodes of the entire Dragonball series. The characters are only similar in name and the story feels like they chewed it up and spit it out and whatever stuck to the storyboard they went with. I wont ruin the story but its nothing like the anime, as i said before the characters are only similar to the anime by name. It almost seems like they wanted to make this movie as bad and as far away from the original story as they could. The only time an actor or actress acts like their anime counterpart is when they are first introduced speaking mainly about Master Roshi and Yamcha.

For one of the most action packed animes around they sure did the opposite with the movie. I can count the number of fight scenes with one hand and count how long they lasted with two hands. Its pretty pathetic when the first fight scene with Goku and the ""bullies"" is the best and he never threw even threw a punch. The big screen debut of the Kamehameha is sad and pathetic and all the Ki blasts look like different color fire balls. They don't look pure energy (like they are in the anime) but just like slow motion fire.

I could go on for hours about what they did wrong. If you have never seen the anime series don't watch the movie. The story is probably too confusing for anyone who doesn't know the entire back-story of the anime. The movie only gives you the who and the what but no why. In fact i think why sums up the entire movie. Why did they do this and why did they do that is all i was thinking during the entire movie. At the end of the movie all i could do was ask ""Why did they make this movie and who did they make this movie for?"" This is not a movie for the fans or anyone who has never seen the anime. It feels like they made this movie for the people who hate the anime.

As a fan of the series I will award this no points and may god have mercy on their souls."
1202,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"For manga and anime fans around the world, the story of Dragonball has to be at the top, or at least in the top 3 of their most beloved manga/anime stories ever written. There is already an existing live action Dragonball movie called Dragonball: The Magic Begins (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122050/) made in Taiwan back in 1989. That movie tried really hard to stay as close as possible to the original story of Dragonball as written by Akira Toriyama, but it ended up being more of a comedy. The entire story also only went up to the Pilaf storyline, which was way before the first Piccolo appearance. This movie, although aged and not exactly a direct interpretation of the Dragonball story, was still appreciated by most fans due to the comedic entertainment value.

Now, another live action Dragonball movie has come, called Dragonball: Evolution. When the first few pictures of this movie appeared on the internet, a lot of the fans already predicted that the movie would turn out horrible because the characters don't look like themselves. The characters were heavily changed and westernized too much, especially Piccolo, the main villain, who didn't look like the one from the manga and anime. Fast forward to a few weeks before the latest Dragonball movie was released, a trailer was leaked on the internet. That trailer spelled the certain doom of the movie to the fans of the show. Most of the comments described the movie as ""Not Dragonball, but another action movie"".

This writer was fortunate enough to be invited to a private screening of the movie, and boy was I surprised! I was already expecting the movie to be bad and not a ""real"" Dragonball, but what I witnessed was something much more horrible! Granted that the movie was really different, but the way the movie progressed, the introduction of characters, the fight scenes, oh wow, you'd think it was a movie created by elementary kids who had no idea what Dragonball was about, except for the ""Kamehameha"" move and the 7 dragon balls, just with the financial backing of a millionaire.

Everything seemed rushed in the movie and characters would just pop out of nowhere and decide to join together to beat Piccolo. The love angle in the story seemed forced as well, everybody was simply out of character. Goku's a powerful but lame school boy, Chi Chi's a martial art school girl who can't even open her own locker, Master Roshi's some crazy dude living in the city (at least he still wears a Hawaiian shirt and seems a little perverted), Bulma became Lara Croft and Rambo combined in another body with a bizarre voice, Mai (originally one of Pilaf's hilarious henchmen in the manga) became a cold blooded, shape-shifting killer, Yamcha became a weird cross between a desert bandit who can't fight and a hobo with unwashed hair, and Piccolo became a weird vampire whose outfit seems to be inspired by the Matrix. I think only Grandpa Gohan was close enough to the original character, except for the way he exits the movie early on.

The fight scenes were lame. Dragonball was about epic sized battles that could not be contained in one location. Characters would get punched through mountains, cities would be destroyed, the earth would rumble and split up due to the massive forces of the fighters. In this movie, everything seemed so lame. Even the Kamehameha attack was used to light some candles! Talk about total weakening!

The only ""good"" things about the movie were the special effects, although the energy blasts seemed very weak.

My advise is, if you're going to pay to watch this movie, DON'T DO IT. Listen to what almost everybody has been saying because they're right, the movie is worse than what you currently have in mind!"
1203,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"This is a total butchering of what I had held great hopes of seeing. The movies attempts to follow the dragon ball story line, meanwhile adding a ""modern"" spin on it (ie. chi chi's castle, and Master Roshi lives in a regular semi whats up with that?). What the viewers want to see is a storyline that follows the cartoon series without any changes, and additions. Overall, the plot is weak, the characters do not look like the cartoons (ie. Yamcha, Master Roshi), the 2D cartoon series had better special effects than the movie (and the series had NO special effects, thats how terrible it was). I created an IMDb account JUST to comment on how they butchered Dragonball for me and I hope that Hollywood is smarter next time as to when they bring such a strong fan based series onto the big screens or they will only infuriate more of the audience."
1204,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"What is wrong with this picture man? Nothing personal to James as a director. I love his Final Destination series, but I think James is NOT the right person to direct this million plus dollars franchise. Why James is hired to direct this movie in the first place? It is a big mistakes. Like having Ang Lee directing the Hulk. Hiring an Asian to direct an Asian animation epic doesn't mean the movie will turn out great. The director must have a vision of the given materials.

The entire outcome is a disaster and disappointment. It is understandable that the film isn't exactly the same as the original comic, but the characters and the plot just suck as a film on its own. From observing the promotion materials of Dragonball, it seems that Fox doesn't want to do this movie at all. The posters suck and the trailers suck. The studio spends a lot of money on making Marvels and DC comics into movies, look how successful those films had become. The studios should pay more respect and faith in Asian materials.

To me this whole thing isn't making any sense at all because there are established fans across the globe, and Dragonball comic and cartoon itself has last more than TWO decades. This is why I think 20th Century Fox was putting money into this project initially. Everyone is looking forward to see a Hollywood version of Dragonball. Soon as I saw the first teaser, I knew I shouldn't put up in any hope into this movie. Even though I went to see the movie without any expectation, the movie still suck! Despite the led down of the Dragonball fans, it creates negative impulses to those who is new to Dragonball.

Dragonball is a hot cult in Asia and it hits the western market because of the stylistic action and fight sequences. However, the martial arts choreography in this movie is another led down. Not to mention the screenplay, the production design of this film is not consistence at all. Wardrobes, props to makeup, nothing fits together! Not only nothing in this film resembles the original DB, it is a disgrace. No wonder they use the word ""Evolution"". But when they say evolution, I don't expect the studio turns something respectable like Dragonball into rubbish. I've seen a live action version of Dragonball shot by the Malaysian years ago. Although it is an exact duplicate of the animation. But the movie is far better than Dragonball Evolution.

A lot of us are looking for a remake of this movie."
1205,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"This Movie plain and simple insults our intelligence, I mean I'm no Geek, but tham they were way off!, this should not even be called dragonball, because of stupid 20th Century Fox, now dragonball is ruined, if someone wanted to make a better movie with the real story that Akira Toriyama made, they made so many changes and mistakes that the dragonball that we know is gone forever, on Watchmen they made some changes but only so the essence of the show could be shown on film, but Dragonball is dead they killed it, I'm sorry Akira Toriyama they ruined your work and about every Anime , and dbz fan out there, like my Grandfather just to say ""there's cheese all over that movie"" It is illogical to spend the money on copyrights if you're not even going to use the story.

Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network, originally disgusted at Otaku decrying the film via leaked set shots and trailers even before the movie was released, gave the movie an overall F grade, admitting that ""The fans were right."" Criticizing the films lack of explaining plot elements to its hackmead storyline and lackluster effort by the actors, he suggested that the film ""Might be fun when you're hammered and surrounded by friends. Or suicidal, and need something to push you over the edge."""
1206,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"This movie is just plain disappointing to say the least. I don't care if this is an adaptation of Dragonball. The only reason why I gave it a 3 out of 10 rating was for the special effects and production value which were semi-decent. I don't understand what was wrong with the original storyline that needed to be changed and messed with. It's the original storyline that made fans love Dragonball in the first place. ""If it ain't broke don't fix it."" I think this movie would do a lot better if they stuck with the original story and had better casting. The real fans would flood the theaters to watch it which would bring hype to the movie for new viewers that don't know about Dragonball, kind of like how Watchmen did. Street Fighter was horrible and they expect to do a sequel to it, this movie was a travesty...I guess next up will be Thundercats and Voltron for Hollywood to mess up for me. Thank you Hollywood for ruining my childhood memories."
1207,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"Hollywood plundering Japanese pop culture isn't something new. From ""Americanizing"" television series for the kids from Power Rangers to Ultraman, and adapting famed characters from Japanese film, games and manga to frequent disastrous effect, it still wouldn't stop the studios from going after one property after another. This time round it's the long running Dragonball series, because the assumption is that the built-in fan base would translate to instant dollars at the box office. Not.

You have to give the filmmakers a little bit of credit though, being either foolhardy, or just plain ballsy. It's a given that they cannot condense and distill the rich content into a surprisingly less than 90 minute movie, and live in the hopes of producing a sequel, or to generate a franchise (i.e. don't leave the cinema hall when the end credits start to roll). But what they successfully do, is to super-summarize the entire mythos by throwing out everything except the main gist of the entire manga, making it extremely simplistic in poor lazy-man standards in adaptation.

For the uninitiated, the film would serve as a quick launchpad to the original manga. For those with a wee bit of knowledge of what it's about (like myself), the film just treads along the same lines and doesn't offer you new information. For the fanboys, I guess you'll only get some kicks at seeing some of your favorite characters come alive, only that they look more Caucasian, and have a head full of hair when they're not supposed to (someone forgot to insist that in the contract?) That's all you're gonna get. Period.

As far as film-making and story-telling techniques go, you can see cliché after cliché being thrown at you, with the poorly and cheaply rendered special effects offering no consolation. Justin Chatwin's Goku is your typical teenager who possesses innate potential yet to be realized, and in his frustration he gets treated by peers as a loser geek. He lives with his grandpa Gohan (Randall Duk Kim in stereotypical know-it-all like in Kung Pu Panda), and develops a crush on school hottie Chi Chi (Jamie Chung). Goku's calling in life is to prevent an apocalypse from happening with the return of chief cardboard baddie Lord Piccolo (an instant shoo-in as one of the worst cinematic villains, ever!) and his temporary sidekick Mai (Eriko Tamura) who attempt to collect 7 dragonballs to fulfill an ancient myth. And of course Goku needs a Fellowship, in the form of irritating tech-wizard Bulma (Emmy Rossum last seen in the sinker Poseidon), mercenary Yum Cha (Joon Park who probably copied Rain's uninspiring cinematic turn in Speed Racer to a T) and Chow Yun-Fat the biggest name of them all here trying his darnest best to act cute as Master Roshi, who imparts skills in double quick time to Goku.

Speaking of time, or the lack thereof, everything is compressed. From two weeks to two days and the day of the blood moon shielding the yellow sun (OK so I made that up), everything moves at so fast a pace, that all you get are cheesy lines of dialog, and an excuse to paste some action sequences together. And James Wong certainly can't direct action (despite being at the helm of Jet Li's The One, which was of course bland and bad), opting to pay homage to Zack Snyder's slow-mo technique, and midway changing the style to having the camera being too close to the action, in the dark, coupled with quick MTV cuts that you don't get to see a thing.

And the rush job just doesn't stop at the narrative or the action. Special effects wise, they look really cheap, and I wonder whether Producer Stephen Chow would roll his eyes at what would be extremely pale when put side by side with his Kung Fu Hustle done many years ago. Ayumi Hamasaki's contribution of the theme song Rule sounded really bad as well (I may get flak from her fans), and I guess having some Asian participation doesn't legitimize what is essentially a poorly done movie. Not even Chow Yun-Fat's star status could save this, and you wonder what figured when this is the movie that he gave up Red Cliff for.

This is basically a movie that only children below the age of 5 will enjoy tremendously, despite having to see 6 half-balls, contributed courtesy of the 3 lead female characters, being continuously flashed on screen, thanks to some neck plunging wardrobe (where's that malfunction when you need one?) Totally bland and really uninteresting, I would suggest sticking to the manga instead."
1208,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"The entire assembly of the film crew and casting is WRONG (excluding the catering and the grip and electric guys). Asia has the first priority to watch such a bad film done by JAMES WONG. Why is he still getting work from Hollywood anyway? ""The One"" was badly done and James is just the worse director ever, I tell ya, he is walking on thin ice in the film industry. He has absolutely no vision of this film. Who hired him anyway? This film is so amateur done that it looks like student film. I can't believe 20th Century Fox distribute a student film worldwide. Btw, did they just put Stehpen Chow's name as the producer as a marketing strategy for Asia? The film ended with a hint of a sequel, and if it does, it will most likely end up re-shooting the entire film (remember of The Hulk). King Piccolo lacks of drive for him to destroy the world. Plot is flat, character drives are lame. Dialogs are stereotype. Ben Ramsey did a poor job as a screenwriter, he is lack of experience to write such an epic movie.

Casting: God damn it, wrong cast dude! Carla Hool, please go back home and do some home work first! Who hired the casting department? I recall the same casting director did the Forbidden Kingdom also cast this movie -- Popping AuYeung. She sucks! Did such a bad job casting in Forbbiden Kingdom and in Dragon Ball. I wonder why is she still surviving in the industry at all. Jamie Chung tries too hard to be cute, and she is ugly. Master Mutaito is a black guy? Emmy Rossum was great in The Day After Tomorrow but not in this movie. I can assure you that it's not really her fault, James just doesn't know what he was doing. Eriko Tamura as Mai is just a redundant character, the wardrobe department tries very hard to dress her up sexy while she is not. By the way, her boobs didn't override her bad acting and ugliness. She must have missed Acting 101 class.

Visual Effect: At some point of the movie, when Guko turns into a gorilla the visual effect was so poorly done that it looks some what like ""Rubber Chicken"". Did they slip in few shots done by stop motion? The face of Gozoru looks like it was done in After Effects, it doesn't look like 3D at all!! First scene of the film, Goku was training with Gohan, the matte painting of the house was so badly done that it looks 2D (cardboard stand) in the background. Blue / Green screen spill was all over, color correction sucks. Visual effect was done much like fresh grad student level. Hollywood have done so much super hero movies in the recent years, and I think the producers just hire the wrong bunch to do such a visual effects intensive film. I believe that Fox knew this film wouldn't go anywhere so they cut budget from hiring the good guys to work on this film!!!

Art Design / Production Design My recommendation is to get Stephen Scott, Simon Lamont and the bunch who did Hellboy to work on DragonBall. The original DragonBall story heavily involves with aliens and action, and I believe that they are the right group of guys to do this film. Their creature designs and makeup fits in this category. Piccolo looks like alien from Mars, one of those ""Mars Attack"" films from the 60s. Costumn in the entire film doesn't match the theme at all, looks like they shop wardrobe from Wal-Mart. The story will be more interesting if it were to take place more into the future (like in the movie Minority Report). The location of Master Roshi's house is totally mismatch to the surrounding backdrop. The matte painting of the city lights and buildings doesn't fit into the picture at all. It is like cut and paste without considering the style, time and place between Roshi's house and the city backdrop.

Stunts / Action Choreography: Poorly done dude! One of the marketing factor of Dragonball is the fighting style and its creative art of fighting sequence. Whatever James did, it looks worse than Street Fighter done by Steven De Souza back in 1994. Yeah, Van Damme could've star in this Dragonball movie. The ""ki"" effect is all over the place,the establish shots of the fight covered up by ""ki"" effect and I couldn't even locate the characters on the screen. They add to much vapor on the ""ki"" effect.

Conclusion: If you want to have endless conversation with your friends about how bad this film is, then go watch it. I believe that Hollywood is running out of idea and beginning to tackle Asia stories. But studio got to have more faith in selling these stories with huge fans around the world: Dragonball, Akira and whatnot. If you cut back the budget, it will end up with a disaster like what James Wong did with this movie! Consider Matrix, Wachowski Bros did a total ripe off from a Japanese Animation ""Ghost in the Shell"". Look what they can achieve with the budget they've got. Of course, skills is also a factor and they have better vision than James as well.

Please re-shoot this FILM!!! I can assure you that all the fans worldwide is looking forward to a re-shoot with different Above the Line and casts"

Dragon Ball are basically numerous spectacular fight-scenes with a tiny bit of plot movement, full of repetitive dialogue and flashy blasts of light and energy, but that hasn't prevented kids and teenagers from eating them up . It contains cartoon violence and minor sexual innuendo than anime series .

The abundant computer generator images , which labor mightily to reproduce the source materials in some impressive scenes and eye-popping look . These adventures can be good for novices and youngsters age 10 should drawn into the story but not for the established fans . James Wong adapts the rich myth of the Dragonball series that grew from a Manga into various popular animated series by means of hundreds episodes that are brought to life with this 20th Century Fox and Stephen Chow ( Kung Fu hustler )production . James Wong is a good writer(21 Jump Street , X-files) , producer (Black Christmas , The others , Milennium) and director (Final destination 1 y 3 , The one , and X files episodes) , but his filmmaking in Dragon Ball is ridiculous and embarrassment .

1212,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"I saw the movie with not too much expectations.. I am one of the skeptics but for a moment there i kept a certain positivism toward the movie.

The movie Is an embarrassment to the manga , the anime , the fans and above all to Akira Toriyama. When I think that the budget for that movie was of 100 Million ..i'm confused of the result.

Special effects are OK they're not AMAZING they're just OK .. Acting seems out of place at so many parts ..

Parts that are supposed to be taken out are not. you can not deny how bad the script was .. I mean Potentially Changing the original story that much i was OK with it because DB-Franchise is very airy so you can revamp characters and situations. However The way the story was presented SUCKED BIG TIME ..Its Amazing Cheeziness for 2009 .. But then again thats James Wong for you .

I'm not really against the actors and their fitting ..they could've fit if there was a better directing .

Almost every aspect of dragonball was changed and i saw little to no representation of the character's true personalities. I went to the movie hoping, no praying for a halfway decent film, all i saw were some decent effects. The only thing that resembles dragonball were the dragonballs and the names of the characters. Every copy of this movie should be destroyed and i will try my best to erase its disturbing images from my mind.

1215,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"My childhood is ruined. I have witnessed the death of a beloved franchise millions have come to adore and respect. This movie is not an adaptation, nor is it an homage of any sort. It is a mockery. A sheer insult to all those whom cherish Dragonball deep within their hearts and souls.

Why does this video-tape recording (I absolutely refuse to deem it 'film' status) fail to such a devastating degree? It does not capture any of the charm, wit, excitement, humor, or bad-assery to be found in its source material. James Wong has simply taken the title, characters, and... errm, hairstyles, and has furtively stapled them to the bloody forehead of a poorly scripted, heavily underdeveloped movie about collecting seven golden balls that when gathered, will summon a flying dragon who will grant you one magical wish! How fantastically whimsical!

Who cares.

There is nothing compelling about this film. It's painstakingly difficult to care about any character in this film, and that goes for Goku as well. Right from the get-go, you bare witness to a horribly underwhelming fight session between Goku and his Asian(?) grandfather Gohan, who carries a bizarrely flawless American accent.. go figure. The reason I imply confusion behind Gohan's Asian ethnicity is that his grandson Goku is, well... nevermind. It isn't even worth getting into; the casting for this movie made no sense. No consistency whatsoever. Disgusting.

The dialogue is cheesy and executed improperly in every way conceivable. You want cheesy dialogue done right? Go watch the Wachowski brothers' Speed Racer released last year, truly a masterpiece as far as anime adaptations are concerned. What is improper about it, you inquire? It causes you to cringe without the ability to hold back. Every single word muttered is a bleak reflection on each actor's terrific inability to act in any way, shape or form.

Speaking of form.. Don't even expect half a thrill from this movie's excuse for action sequences. These actors cannot fight under any set of circumstances. The wirework is so blatant and poorly imposed that I swear to have caught eye of a couple unedited out wires left in some of the more acrobatic scenes.

Really? Come on, Hollywood. Come on, Fox.

These sort of mistakes became a thing of the past DECADES prior. If a movie based on the almighty Dragonball franchise is going to suck this severely OUTSIDE of the fight sequences, at LEAST refine those few scenes (Dragonball's saving graces, so to speak) into something worthy of admission price. Get a couple professional choreographers on the set to help out, if you don't mind. (what a strange and unusual concept, huh!?)

I've said it before and I'll say it again; if this entire project had been up to the legendary Stephen Chow, we could have had a sheer masterpiece on our hands. (refer to Kung Fu Hustle, what I believe to be the most faithfully Dragonballesque live action movie ever made)

I shall continue no further. This movie does not deserve any longer of a review. In fact, slice this eloquently written verdict in half and it would still be far too flattering in length.

I feel that if FOX wishes to maintain any credibility they have left with their audiences, they will hold back on dumping this atrocious landfill upon the United States' precious array of cinemas. Of course, we know this is not realistic.

It's nice to dream."
1216,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"From looking at some of the reviews on here, I will keep mine simple as people seem obsessed one way or another. I am reviewing this film on the credits.

1. Relation to the original series. 2. Quality of script 3. quality of actors/actresses/acting 4. quality of effects 5. Final product.

This film bears two relations to the original. The characters and the Dragonballs. There is nothing else to link the two. This is so sad when you consider how much they had to work with and all they could produce was this. The characters also bear little resemblance to their anime predecessors. None of them do what they are supposed to do, except Chi Chi, who didn't do much anyway. Where's Roshi's turtle shell. Why does Bulma carry several fully automatic weapons? And why is Yamcha now a ladies man? To their credit though, Roshi's behaviour soon after he appears is very accurate even if it is short lived.

The script for this film is its downfall. It's just awful. The writers have tried to fit too much into a short period of time. This film needed to be 2.5 to 3 hours long to even come close to allowing all the characters to be fleshed out. Attention should have been paid to Transformers when they were making this film. If you want to make a film based on a TV series, as those who watched it, not a bunch of suits that are paid to watch it and come up with a story. Many people who enjoyed the show could have given suggestions throughout the whole movie making experience.

AS bad as the film was, it doesn't take anything away from the actors themselves. They did the best they could with the tools they had. If you ask a builder to build you a house out of sticks, don't complain when it falls over.

This film had all the effects of an 80's movie. Think of A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors and the scene where the Freddie battles the kid in the wheelchair. That's the level of effects in this film. And I will leave the dragon, Shenron, so you come to your own conclusions. I don't want to seem prejudiced.

This film lands not just way off the mark for a spin off movie, it's in another continent. They should never have made it if it was going to be so lack lustred. It could have been done with a comedy element, which would have saved it, but no. They even try to throw in romance, but you have only seen the characters for an hour so who cares. Why so many inconsistencies from the original anime series? For example, Roshi does not live on an island. All these little details could have been included with another hour of film time. No one wants to watch an 88 minute film nowadays. Its just not value for money. Some may think that 1 out of 10 is harsh, but when they made such a hash of what could have been another Transformers, its all it deserves."
1217,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"I almost vomited when I saw the preview for this movie. It's like taking a child, raping it and then throwing out of a moving car at 80 mph and leaving it for dead. Did anyone in the making of this movie even watch one episode of DB, DBZ, or DBGT? Special places in hell are reserved for asses like this. For one, the whole base of the story is completely off, not that it makes a huge difference because the acting alone is enough to make even the smallest of fans to the Dragonball universe cry and hang their heads in shame. This is nothing but a baseless rip off of one of the most celebrated anime classics and unfortunately more and more movies are heading in this direction.

Taking MAJOR characters out IS NOT a MINOR adaptation, it is just plain stupid. This movie is just fox trying to make a quick buck and they don't care what they rip off. I'm a HUGE fan of Toriyama and when i heard that he isn't even involved in the writing of the movie i STARTED to have doubts. When i saw the first trailer and i heard gokus character say ""I don't think i can do this"" I pretty much lost all faith in the movie. It's an insult to toriyama it's an insult to the franchise and it's an insult to the fans of the dragonball series. Goku is a highschool student while in the series he'd never even met a girl before. In the series he didn't even know the meaning of the words ""give up"". Minor adaptations i can handle but this is just plain sad."
1223,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"This must be the most disrespectful film ever made, this movie shows what Hollywood is all about these days... money..money.. and more money. To take Akira Toriyamas epic story about Goku and his friends and turn it in to low budge wanna be Asian action movie is just unbelievable.. I would be very surprised if the director even had read the manga himself...

Dragonball is the one manga who made it's way to the western countries and open the way for other big mangas as Naruto, Bleach, Death note and many more. The Dragonball manga is not only before its time in many ways but also very amusing and always has a got plot and amazingly good designed characters.

I really hope no one buys this movie, just to show Hollywood that we don't want your greed hands on epic tales like dragonball... Whats next then, well hey lets take the no 1. manga at the time, Naruto and put some bad acting actors in the movie and lets put an ending to the manga thats not even finished... thats sound great man, much much money there to get.

All i have to say is SHAME on you Hollywood... Try to get back the glory you ones had and don't do it by trampling on millions dedicated fans.. This could have been your most bestselling movie this year if you just had put your soul into it.

this movie made me sad, angry and numb... but did shred a light on what movie making is all about these days.... pathetic.."

1226,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"Take a childhood memory; a movie, a toy, a song, or most appropriately here, a television show. Now imagine everything you loved about that nostalgic pastime and then envision a lucky break where you were asked to direct a brand new movie adaptation of that piece of your history. And finally, ask yourself, so you think it possible to remove every single aspect that made that memory so special? Could you do it? Would you, as a fan, be literally capable? Well the people behind Dragonball Evolution certainly managed too, as they manage to drain every iota of fun, charm or wit out of a much loved series.

Back when I was young I always found a great deal of fun to be found in the anime import Dragonball Z. I was by no means a die-hard fan; I watched only the first few seasons and even as a grade-schooler I could pick out consistent pace issues and gaps in logic. But yet, it was goofy, bloody, wildly inappropriate fun. It would stand to reason a director could draw at least some of the spirit of the Dragonball universe by simply watching the shows or reading the sources material and yet James Wong (who also directed The One and Final Destination 1 and 3) manages to do just that; change fun into camp, over-the-top violence into PG rubbish and alter any of the interesting back-story and lore of the series into an unwatchable tedious origin story.

Perhaps I am missing the mark hugely, but vibe of the film is all off, and I assure you I am not an adaptation Nazi, nihilistically picking out every detail not identical to the source material but I just kept uttering under my breath ""What IS this?!?!"" To that end I am not sure who this film will impress. It will surely not draw in new fans, and as you may have gathered, I am of the impression fans will not be too thrilled either. The opening half of the film is droning, tedious schlock, which then gives way to ridiculous camp, which finally falls into an at least half-successful final act. There is also the possibility that Dragonball will simply never work as a live action adaptation, the anime medium just suits the feel and bizarre pleasure of the story and characters.

The plot (a term I use loosely) is beyond excusable and consists merely of young warrior Goku (the fresh faced Justin Chatwin), his master Roshi (a mildly entertaining Chow Yun-Fat who must be strapped for cash) a feisty gun-slinger named Bulma (Emmy Rossum) and a creepy hippie conman named Yamcha (Joon Park). Joining forces, they seek to collect 7 mystical Dragonballs, which when brought together grant their holder one wish. But on their trail is the evil Lord Piccolo (James Marsters) and an assassin (Enriko Tamura). The plot suffers further from the bit part from Piccolo which leaves the story with barely a central antagonist, and the plodding pace, unforgivable dialogue and general lack of momentum compile into just a pile of rubbish.

The final battle finally brings out the style of fighting most fans are accustomed too, but it's too little to late and an insane twist involving Goku is beyond cringe-worthy. The only thing Dragonball Evolution is good for curing is a leg cramp, because 10 minutes of this film and your legs will be involuntarily shuffling out of the theatre.

1230,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"Okay, let me start by saying. At age 8 I found out about Dragonball, I watched the entire season, all the way into the uncut fully Japanese airing of Dragon Ball Z, and then segued into GT. I am 23 now and have long stopped caring about anything ANIME. However, when I caught wind of this, I ignored all the e-chiming in my forums and IM's and immediately located the trailer. Needless to say I laughed and thought it was another Prank (like the Zelda trailer back in 07).

So, with that said, know, this is coming from someone who nerded out to Dragonball series for years, and have long since grown out of that liking into almost disliking the entire thing. However I was drawn to check it out anyways.

This movie, is probably the worst series -> movie ever made. This movie is good to use to make other movies grand. Ever want to push through a horrible movie just to say you watched it? Well kill two with one stone, watch this one, then go watch the other and you'll have such a biased stance on films in that moment you'll love it. Dragonball Evolution fails on every point.

So before I dismantle this movie, I will note one good thing about it. It had: Emmy Rossum. Granted, her role wasn't classy like her other ones, but she is a nice actress to come across, and she brought back sexiness combined with duel wielding pistols.

So for the non-nerd people who may go see this for any other reason than ""being a fan (or old fan) of the show(s)"". This movie fails at being anything worth a fighting or action movie. There is one cool fight scene, and I promise you, you can save time and just go watch the clip of The Forbidden Kingdom fight of JC and JL.

Sorry, but watching a pasty white boy doing karate is actually insulting to my own eyes. I almost gave up on modern American Kung Fu movies when I saw Forbidden Kingdom, but after watching that weaselly looking Gokou, I have officially given up. We can only hope that Stephen Chow makes another movie soon to give us hope that China is still in the race to make Kung Fu movies.

The graphics of this movie reminded me of the bulky techno special effects from Super Mario Brothers. Yea, the one with John John Leguizamo. The energy fights were anything but spectacular. Want an idea of what they looked like? Go watch that Covenant Movie (yes, the one about male witches being cool, right?). Remember the end to that movie with the energy ball fight? Well add blue and red to those balls and there you have it. But dare I say - THE COVENANT MAGICAL FIGHT was more intense, and better done than the DRAGONBALL ENERGY FIGHT.

Also, when the characters would produce intelligence on the plot and foreground to background of the history of this world they live on, it sounded worst than your 10th grade history teacher teaching you about Sumatra. It was as if the actors were holding their scripts in their own hands and reading right off of it. Luckily, Rossum, didn't do any explaining, so her image is at least not so tarnished from this movie.

Finally, for those wondering, isn't Dragonball from Asia, and don't all the characters from the first and second series have Japanese related names. (I say first and second as Pan and Bra don't really fit). However in this movie, there's only 4 Asian characters. The rest of the characters look like they got lost on their way to the MEAN GIRLS 2 set. (No, there isn't going to be another one. Sorry.) As for old school fans of the Anime. As you can read, this movie lacks anything cool for any outsiders view. The fighting is horrible, the graphics are lame, the acting is atrocious. As for comparing it to the show? They got the characters names right, and that's about it.

Just watch the trailers and teasers. You'll be able to see. Even the profound KamehameHa move sounds like it is done by a pubescent teenager.

Avoid this movie, at all costs.

Note the director's name, avoid that as well."
1231,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"Look I am not a massive fan of Dragon Ball Z I used to watch the show but afterwords it just got boring and repetitive. Plus some of the character designs in that show looked pretty weird. I came across this movie on film 4 and I watched to the end. There was literally no story. The acting was bad, yet there was action and most of the cast are american. But I have to admit the woman who played Chi Chi was cute, beautiful and hot as the character and she was one of the good things to come out of the movie.

1234,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"Reading the reviews, it's possible to think that this is regarded as bad purely because of a vocal fan-base for the original. For instance, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a good film, but thanks to a small group of noisy 'fans' a lot of the reviews online are negative. This is not the case here. I have never seen/read the original, and I still found this to be a bad film. The CG effects look like something from a SyFy original, the acting at times is reminiscent of Neil Breen, and the whole thing comes across as a goofy mess trying desperately to look like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. If you enjoy bad films like I do, it's worth a watch as it will make you laugh at how bad it is. "
1235,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"It is a complete disgrace, It is a steaming pile. I'm ashamed to introduce this movie to my friends who haven't watch the original series. How dare the director make our childhood series become a twilight. I'm so insulted by this, even the original DBZ creator was so angered he started making DBS which is not as good as DBZ but its still worth watching compared to 'dragon ball evolution'. I have a better name for this movie, I'll call it ""Disgraceful balls of Emostuff"". This is my 1st time writing a review, which I don't ever do other than rate movies but this movie angered me to the point I can't take it anymore that's why I'm writing this review.

1236,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"Dragonball Evolution was the kind of movie a theater should pay someone five bucks to see and tell them that it sucks. The only way to improve the film would be to start from scratch and have whatever pre-teen schoolgirl that wrote that god awful story take a look at either the original manga or television series.

I had hopes for it. Dragonball was the catalyst series that got me into drawing and wanting to make cartoons. This movie crushed me. I cannot believe ANYONE thought this was a good idea. Everything about this movie is just so incredibly horrible its unbelievable! The acting-Bad. The story-Bad. The special effects-BAD! Nothing about this movie was good or original. It's like star wars, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Lord of the Rings, and a cheap made for TV special all melded together to create a half hour of disappointment, agony and the destruction of childhood memories.

Don't pay to see this. In fact, don't see it all because you will be crushed and angry. Remember how Southpark portrayed Lucas and Spielberg after the last Indianna Jones movie? Even comedy Central wouldn't let them air what Fox did to Goku. It's just BAD.

And those of you that like this movie, or even think it's okay...don't even. Encouraging this film is like spitting in Toriyam's face."

What you have here is a movie so emotionally devasting,that you will feel the need to be hit(twice if needed) by your friend if what you're seeing is actually real, this movie challenges the viewers to come up with their interpretations just like David Lynch's Eraserhead, The Holy Mountain and the mind-screwing Neon Genesis Evangelion(hopefully Fox picks up the rights of the show, so we can have another carefully crafted masterpiece like this one),the story is nothing short of riveting almost as good as Karate Kid and Kung-Fu Panda combined together-""Goku is a social misfit(just like he is in the anime) who gets bullied by the token black-guy and can't get the girl(just like in the anime - it feels like you are being wrapped into it)then his grandpa Gohan is killed by Piccolo(the aftermath of his death didn't feel exactly like Uncle Ben's death in Spider-Man, which was a relief cuz I had a weird feeling it would be similar)then Bulma appears and takes him to this guy Roshi,and then they go on to some cannon searching the so-called dragon balls,all right, and then they find Yamcha, cool, and hip as always with his funny one-liners,then he falls in love with Bullma and then Piccolo pops out, and the final fight between good and evil begins,they fight on and on and on... then in the middle of the fight Goku feels the need of taking a du... er... he transforms in some sorta ManBearPig-like monster(nice reference to South Park) called Ozaru and then Piccolo takes full-control of him or whatever I didn't pay much mind since my eyes were blurry from some of the action scenes and tears of joy of this tour-de force experience, some people may complain on how the story was shortened and rushed,but hey, it's not like you actually know your stuff, let the talented-one get it right,as cramming everything together in 90 minutes was the most obvious thing to do -DUH,the characters are so complex as they unfold throughout the movie,kids may have a hard time watching this cuz of the PG rating because the movie relies way too much on social commentaries against our society and the way we see life - for instance- the scene where Yamcha stars to talk out that cool-sounding stuff is obviously taken off from the harsh-times our economy is going through, you might be fooled on this one since Dragon Ball or Dragonball(whatever you may like to call it) was meant to be kiddy show, but here they kid you NOT.The character are a little different from their anime counterparts but it doesn't matter at all especially considering how you can actually connect with them in a emotional and witty way albeit complicated manner, we have Goku, brilliantly-written I must say though, lines such as ""teach me how to be normal"" and his awkwardness throughout the high-school scenes were a delight to the human eye, and kept me on the edge of my seat in an infinite loop of awe, Bulma, well, was a b... interesting character and so are Roshi, Chi-Chi, Yamcha - who were too depth for my own good though. And those nice-looking monks(so happy that Bill Murray was somehow injected in the scene), now let's get back to Piccolo, his motive is unknown, we don't what he really wants... destroy or control the world, that's the question, right? In my humble opinion I think it's up to the viewer to answer these questions just like what happened with The Joker in The Dark Knight so that makes it intriguing by default(and very cool, too). Nothing about this masterpiece felt like a cop out, I swear.""

The battle scenes are (Y)AWWW-MA-ZZZZZZZZZZZ-ING, I'm not kidding you. One can notice that the idea for them definitely didn't come straight from Spider-Man or The Matrix, the cinematography was beautiful shot I may have collapsed during the movie because of its beauty, thankfully I was revived by the doctors in the theater who were bitting their own nails out of the pure excitement to see this ""legend"" come to life. At the end of the movie my whole-theater had a mad orgasm that could have been heard in the whole galaxy. I'm more than hopeful that this movie will beat the poop out of TDK and Titanic at the box-office and will spawn more sequels than Police Academy and The Land Before Time combined. After this movie I am proud to say that Tom Rothman is god, the way he rushes project... whoops, I mean the way he picks up franchises randomly and put them into production as fast as he can so the fans don't have to wait any longer without looking for a extended profit, he is a very kind individual, a man worth of trust, and we should all be thankful for that, may Jebus bless yer little caring heart.

I AM also so glad that my children will grow up with movies like this and not those overrated Miyazaki's movies which are boring and lame besides every single movie(released or yet-to-be-released) will fall flat in comparison to this milestone of cinema. Especially taking into account that it takes place in a culture blinded by Kayne West, Fergie, Crapformers, American Psycho...

For my money THE SINGLE BEST MOTION PICTURE OF THIS CENTURY. Still, Isn't that great that everyone's children will grow up with this sincere and honest movie. Kamehaha-IT."

1242,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"Dragonball is arguably the best manga/anime ever made. It has an immense amount of popularity that has transcended cultures and become a profitable mainstream commodity worldwide. It has stood the test of time and has been a great inspiration to so many after it.

With that said, this movie is a travesty to the product name. The rich characters and carefully crafted story of the manga are carelessly shotgunned onto the screen. The dialog is poor, the acting never gets any better than what we'd find on a mediocre evening kids show, the CG bounces unevenly between barely passable and awful, and most importantly, the fight scenes (and lack of) just plain stink.

Dragonball has always been about being epic and larger than life. One glance at the cartoon would demonstrate how they would spend a ridiculous amount of time on building up a fight and then pay it all off with a great one. The manga was always about fantastical ideas, crazy fighting styles, even crazier special moves, and the all important which fighter is stronger debate that was made exponentially better once power levels got involved in DBZ. Simply put, none of this magic was brought over, and too much time is spent on things Dragonball was never known for. Dragonball was never about romance, as it was about family, friendship, and respect.

In fact, the Goku/Chi Chi relationship was never emphasized in the comic and always took a back seat to the important matters at hand, like saving the world and working together to accomplish that. The film must have spent like 25% of the time trying to build up this relationship when the manga might have spent 0.1%. I honestly do not believe this kind of lowest common denominator to attract the interest of the female audience was necessary at all. Dragonball never had trouble creating a fan base, so this really feels like one of the many big missteps of the film.

In terms of the characters, they really made a mistake in blending the young and old Goku of the original story, which resulted in one that just seems unlikable. Goku was always a bit goofy and was certainly flawed, but he was never a dope like the one we see here. People not familiar with the manga will probably come off with absolutely no idea why Goku is so well adored by all the fans. Next, the ultimate bad boy Piccolo is completely underused with very little screen time. Yamcha is nothing like the one we know, and is made to be a bad comic relief of some sort. Chow Yun Fat's Roshi is close to unwatchable. You cannot blame Chow Yun Fat for trying his best, but he's just a terrible miscast for the role. Fat does the cool stuff well, but this stuff just isn't in his nature, and it shows. Rossum's Bulma actually comes off alright and is probably the best character adaptation out of all of them. She looks great in the role and does pretty much everything you'd expect out of Bulma.

Dragonball is the crown jewel of the manga/anime business, which makes it only that much more disappointing that the people involved with this film clearly did not understand what people liked so much about it in the first place. It plays like a B-movie with D-class quality in everything except budget. Fortunately, Dragonball is just too big for even this big tub of junk to cause any long lasting hurt to the franchise."

This was the worst movie I have ever seen.

I left the theater very, very depressed.

Every single person in involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves.

The acting was horrible, the dialogue sucked, the story was as stale and rehashed as... I don't know... day old hashbrowns? Look, either they put together a team that can do this movie justice, or they get the people that did FFVII Advent Children and Resident Evil: Extinction to do a CGI version.

Bottom line, this movie was, from start to finish, DEPRESSING AS HELL. The original cartoon (especially the original Dragon Ball series) was incredibly funny and upbeat. I never saw Goku getting put down or picked on.

This is just typical Hollywood thinking that if they water everything down for the lowest common denominator they'll generate the most revenue. Hopefully the next team to undertake a project of this magnitude will give it the RESPECT it deserves and not give us more D-list Hollywood GARBAGE."
1252,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not just a lame fan boy who is all upset because Bulma doesn't have blue hair. And I'm also not a boring troll who will sit and trash any movie he can for fun. I happen to love the whole Dragon Ball saga, and I have since I was little, but I'm also a realist and know that things need to be changed for cinema.

This movie, however, is a piece of crap on so many levels.

For example, I'm also a big fan of Harry Potter books. I hate the 'Prisoner of Azkaban' due to so many liberties being taken with the film. However, after re-watching it, I still have to respect that it is a good, well-made film. 'Dragonball Evolution' is just straight-up terrible in every possible sense of the word.

The ""story"" here is basically, a teenager named Goku is given a mystical Dragon Ball from his grandfather. After twenty minutes of bad teen dialogue, awkward stumbling through lines and the worst back story in history, Goku sets off to find Master Roshi to alert him that Lord Piccolo has returned.

Now, some of the fight scenes are decent, most of them are not (a lot of unnecessary slow-motion). That scarcely makes up for the wooden, horrible acting on display. Justin Chatwin is probably the most un-emotional actor I've ever seen. I've never met a more unlikeable hero; in fact, I hated him. Anyone who knows Goku from the television series.. Could you imagine hating Goku? Lord Piccolo is also the worst cinematic villain in history, at no real fault of James Marsters. Piccolo was scarcely in the movie, and he did nothing. Also, the way he was introduced was basically.. ""We locked up Piccolo. He's back! Aw crap"" and that was it. Piccolo also has a random girl named Mai who is a shape shifter and does all of his bidding. So, the only thing this movie really stirs up is apathy, as I couldn't even force myself to care about any of the characters.

All in all, if you are the type of person who likes to watch bad movies for their comedic value, this one is priceless. From a slow motion crying scene to the most predictably bad cheesy dialogue ever, this one has it all. To be fair, Chow Yun-Fat is pretty entertaining as Roshi. Oh, and there is no shortage of cleavage shots, for you guys out there.

Case in point all the Fantastic Four movies, Alien, Predator, and X-men. Now they slide their slimy hands into anime. making one of the sorriest excuses of a film I've seen in years. Yeah the characters have the same names and there are winks at the series for fans but the essence of the series is never captured and the entire film feels like western studio drivel.

I don't understand why Fox would let such a monstrosity into theaters.To put it blankly, it was unfit even for a straight to DVD film.In my opinion, this movie may have potential as a high school film festival entry.

1261,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"Who said little green men don't exist? According to James Wong they do and, according to James Wong, they make excellent baddies. He couldn't be more wrong, as our antagonist ""lord Piccolo"" makes his way onto the screen, without a flowing introduction, several sly laughs Eco around the cinema as I hear from one corner ""Do I have to sit through 90 minutes of this"". Fortunately, with the movie opening nationwide tomorrow you still have hope of saving yourself, Lord Piccolo is the very least of this movies problems I assure you. I've heard from fans of the series, a series which i don't watch, that the movies follows the story reasonably closely. Now it's clear why I didn't watch the series. The plot is paper thin a mere excuse for an onslaught of cheesy on liners and attempts at wetting our appetite for the painfully obvious twist that's clear a mile off. You'd think that the director of ridiculous but tense thriller ""Final Destination"" would be able to conjure up the same tongue in cheek playfulness with this. And yet any sense of self ridicule is miles away, it feels almost as if Wong thinks he is making a good movie. So for a good hour and a half we are subject to colors thrown at our face, some of the worst direlogue I've ever had to sit thorough and acting that would shame Keanu Reeves.

James Wong adapts the rich mythos of the Dragonball series that grew from a manga into various popular animated series with this 20th Century Fox production starring Justin Chatwin. The plot revolves around Goku (Chatwin), Earth's greatest champion, who must defend the planet against an invading race of alien warriors hell-bent on dominating the universe. Wong directs from his own script, with Kung Fu Hustle's Stephen Chow producing. Buffy the Vampire Slayer's James Marsters co-stars as the film's villain, Piccolo, with Jamie Chung playing Chi Chi and Emmy Rossum portraying Bulma. Hong Kong legend Chow Yun-Fat rounds out the cast as Master Roshi, Goku's mentor in the film. The story develops at a breakneck pace, granted there is little story to develop, while its good to know the movie is so short, the less of it you have to endure.

Think back to this time last year, a certain manga adaptation was released under the name ""Speed Racer"" this hard, cold, emotionless shell of a movie sported the same recycled material that Dragonball Evolution does. It's nothing but cutsie visual jokes mixed up with some of the worst dialogue in film history. Our protagonist delivers this line with a stale drone ""I am Goku. I am Oozaru. In order to defeat you, I must be one with myself"" and it's only downhill from there. The acting is all over the place ranging from the over eccentric Master Roshi played by Chow Yun-Fat (who really needs to fire his agent) to the mellow underused Chi Chi (Jamie Chung) who is by far the best actor present. Though I'm not sure whether or not to blame these actors of to blame James Wong for the way he directed them. I've seen each and every person here gives great performances in different movies and it is possible for them to deliver dialogue without sounding like a reject from Street Fighter.

Verdict: Tearing through its mystical, who-gives-a-toss storyline like a drunk bat bouncing off cave walls, Dragonball's cocktail of cheap effects, eye-rolling clichés and dismal direlogue will have fans of the series condemning it as a beyond-lame failure. Dragonball: Evolution is so lazy and cheap in every aspect of its execution that the end result is almost unwatchable. It's clear no effort has gone into yet another Fox production - The Day the Earth Stood Still anyone? - why anyone would pay to this is beyond me, if your forced however, make sure to order the nachos cause there's plenty of cheese. For my overall rating I give Dragonball Evolution 1/5."
1262,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"It gets done wrong then have to wait another 10 years for someone to come and do it right. This has potential to be a great movie and introduce a whole new audience to DragonBall. Characters need to be older, as we all know Goku as a father not a high school kid. Not point starting the character young to build up to future movies if the first movie is at risk of flopping.

I'm sure will be a nice movie, but nice movies don't get remembered and turned into sequels. Well that is not totally true, for some reason some people tend to make average movies into less than average sequels. But also the reverse does happen. If this flops for obvious reasons they may come back with a improved sequel the way the fans want it.

First off, I didn't like the modern setting. Why couldn't they stick to the original show? I honestly think they should just remake this movie. There were no awesome powers or crazy fight scenes. The villains also sucked. The dialog was very poorly written as well.

From the start, you have very unlikeable characters. Almost everyone was very poorly cast. I thought Goku and Master Roshi were fine, but Bulma was absolutely terrible. I hated her and really wanted her to die.

The ending made me very angry also. I was hoping that there would be some epic fight, but again, I was very disappointed. After this ""fight"" was over, I was left scratching my head in disbelief.

Terrible dialog, awfully cast characters, and a pathetic journey and ending should have made Dragonball Evolution a straight to DVD release.

Didn't care if there were not-known actors. And i swear the first 52 seconds of the movie passed and I said: "" I want my money back"" But i didn't leave hoping of seeing a bit Dragonball ? No- this movie is so utterly crap I think it makes the writers of Dragonball Z cry. Extremely cheesy- acting, plot, story, this movie is 1hour 20min long what the f*ck ?

It would have been better to cut the scenes in school as I don't really remember much of Goku's life studying or probably I just missed them shown on TV. Goku's transformation into an ape was poorly done. I like Emmy Rossum as Bulma; she did well. Chatwin was alright. I think the movie should have to be re-shoot better fight scenes, extreme power for destructions (that is what Dragonball was known for). The movie failed to make me a part of it as I wasn't really seeing myself immersed and wanting to see more. My eyes riveted on the screen hoping to see more but the movie was just it has it can offer; it made me unhappy. I wont recommend this movie; this should have just been put on the shelves for TV/cable view"
1274,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"OK were to start, with this awful movie. First fan in and out. ,have the original anime series on DVD (well the ones that are out). Second At least it is considered a start, a good start...no, terrible start, but a start nonetheless.

Characters, master roshi, good actor choice no one can argue, but he had to be more perverted towards bulma/more perverted anyway and has to be more clumsy in my opinion. The character as Goku, my lord, cliché after cliché. Knowing the results before they happen leaves no experience to go on with the movie (it isn't hard to guess after each incident what will/would happen next). And how come Goku wasn't getting trained to much or use of his stick (by Roshi), tell about 'rushed' results. Last for Goku is..""The HAIR"", young, old, new, anything, Goku is known for the hair, not somewhat a 70's cut like in this movie, but actually hair that is so out there like the anime's, people know him just by the hair (hair result in movie = failed). For piccolo, the fan that wrote on IMDb, Piccolo, 'looks like a vampire and his costume is matrix to a T', nailed it on the review. It's 2009 and piccolo looked like 1999 horror movie, and his clothes??? where is the cap and hat that weigh him down in training come on give me/us something!! Yamcha wasn't bad (by bad, his acting was OK), but kind of useless (his character). I guess the director never really saw or understood the Yamcha character from the anime (i wont spoil, watch the movie, understand the cartoon and you'll see). Yamacha supposed to be some what a good fighter, epically in DB not so much DBZ or DBGT, although in all of them Yamcha stands out most in DB as a strong/somewhat equal fighter to Goku. In this movie, he was just a bandit, with no talent except to rob.....bore! Now for the females, meaning Chi Chi and Bulma/hell even the other 'bad' chick. All are beautiful(bulma more than the others), Chi Chi(second) was like a goku character, cliché after cliché, knowing either what her line is/was going to be, or knowing what will/would/is going to happen to her, or around her. Bulma's role wasn't to bad (although needs more GREEN to her hair, maybe she can borrow some from the awful looking Piccolo), she was what she kind of is/was in the amine. Smart/and a good fighter. The cheesiness in her lines comes from what the director puts in the script so you can't fault her for those. The morphing chick mai, pretty but in the end useless. Yea she helps the evil character to conquer the earth but come on, her powers aren't and were never really useful to help someone like a Piccolo. You can tell when she morphs to someone else, and is going to be plotting evil or bad things (i wont mention parts in movie, but you will be strictly able to guess them while watching/if ever watching :)).

In the end i say 3, why? Because it does use the name dragonball, and does have dragonball characters, and tries to be/tie the 'dragonball' concept but fails, and fails miserably. So it's like a bad action movie, except fans of the original anime/and others will want to watch this movie just to see what 'bad' action for a DB/DBZ/DBGT fan really means.

2 last notes - Visual effects, it looks 50/50 on arguments for these....unless they were low on cash, the effects plain out suck, i can do better with the comp I'm using to write this. No offense, people that think there OK to Good, i dunno what movie you were watching but the effects were below par..and far below par, like the script of this movie. Second - Oh yea, the dragon (shenron), did anybody find the dragon was like the size of a big whale or something (not to be funny?? Remember this dragon (Shenron) is supposed to be the size of the earth/universe/ something huge to show how important he is, and in the movie, he is like the 'baby Shenron' so tiny and looks useless (useless by how he grants the wish's), and why dosen't he talk??

Anyways 3/10, that's pushing the 3."

The worst part for me was when they started mixing in CRAP from Avatar: The Last Airbender. With the Kamahameha wave being the ultimate 'AIR BENDING' technique. And Piccolo being a Fire Bender using the Oozaru form of Goku as a slave.

Only good thing in this movie was Bulma, Chi Chi, and that chick w/ Piccolo, Asian boobies! They didn't even show nimbus, the kame house, Yamcha had no scar, no tien, no krillin, GOKU Doesn't HAVE A TAIL BUT CAN TURN INTO OOZARU This movie sucked. Period. The End.

The matter is that this movie had a budget of millions of dollars, and i still prefer the Chinese version.

1280,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"Goku is a high school student. He's a bit of a loser, he gets picked on by bullies, and has trouble talking to girls (especially Chi-Chi, on whom he has a crush). However, Goku has a secret. He has these powers, which make him incredibly powerful in just about every way possible. He is an orphan, and lives with is grandfather, Gohan, who trains him to fight. But he warns Goku that he shouldn't use his powers to fight schoolyard bullies, only on the great powers of darkness that are inevitably going to show up fairly soon, or else people will get bored and leave the theatre. On his eighteenth birthday, he is given by his grandfather a mysterious spherical object called a Dragonball. There are only seven of these in existence, and anyone who collects all of them will be granted one single perfect wish (I assume that means one without any conditions. So is wishing for more wishes allowed?) So anyway, Goku is distracted from his school work by Chi-Chi. Later that day, she is having trouble opening up her electronic locker (the film is set in the near future, or a parallel universe, or something like that), so, in order to impress her, he uses his powers to open it for her. This does indeed impress her, and she invites him to a party she is having that night. However a group bullies shows up at the party, and call him names. Goku, not wishing to disobey his grandfather, but still wishing to cause these people as much pain as possible, gets into a fight with them, but instead of inflicting any blows, he merely dodges the attacks made against him so that his aggressors hurt themselves rather than him. This impresses Chi-Chi further, and they talk. You get the impression that they're about to almost kiss, however the actual plot (finally) kicks in, and Goku rushes back home to find his Gohan murdered by a green alien played by James Marsters, called Piccolo. He is after the Dragonball that Goku inherited that day, so he can use it for his own evil purposes.

Sound familiar? Well, it should, because there is very little, if anything at all, that is original about Dragonball: Evolution. It begins as a generic high school drama filled with clichés we've all seen a million times before, and have no real desire to see again, especially in what is supposed to be an action film. Eventually, it becomes an adventure movie, as Goku teams up with a girl called Bulma, who wants to locate all the Dragonballs so that she can be famous; Yamcha, a thief who wants to harness their power to gain immense wealth; as well as Master Roshi, a perverted, middle-aged man whom Gohan, before dying in Goku's arms (just before, of course, the obligatory ""believe in yourself, and you can do anything"" speech) tells him to locate. I believe that Gohan and Roshi were friends, or something. I only walked out of the cinema about an hour ago, and already I am forgetting what exactly the movie is about. Yes, you guessed it, they're looking for the Dragonballs, before they fall into Piccolo's sinister hands. There's not really much else to talk about that concerns the film, to be honest. There is an adventure, but you've undoubtedly seen something like it many times before (all that's different is what they happen to be looking for). There's action, but it's poorly executed (especially after the recent Watchmen, which had a similar style of action; only it, as well as the movie itself, was executed in a far superior manner). There's also romance (between Goku and Chi-Chi, as well as Bulma and Yamcha), but it's so contrived that it's laughable (a romantic scene between the former two ended with a sarcastic round of applause from the audience, myself included). The scenes that are meant to be humorous are far less amusing than the ones that are trying to be serious.

While I wouldn't consider myself a fan of either the manga or anime upon which Evolution is based, these are both far superior works to this movie, and definitely worth checking out.

As for Dragonball: Evolution (in case you haven't already worked it out)as far as I'm concerned, it is a bad movie. However, I would actually recommend watching it, because much of it is unintentionally amusing, and it does give off a so-bad-it's-good-vibe,

But still, a movie that's so bad it's good is still, well, bad."

Whenever you are going to make a film using names, items, settings, etc. from a franchise as big as DBZ you would take into account that nearly 98% of your viewers will be fans of the franchise. (DBZ) Apparently James Wong does not agree. But, hey, everyone knew withing 5 months of preproduction that they weren't going to follow the story so we all did this. We all accepted that it wasn't a DBZ movie and watched it expecting at least an OK movie considering they had a budget of *cough cough* one hundred million dollars! *holds pinkie to mouth* OK heres the serious. The movie was atrocious. It was closer to the power rangers than the z fighters. None of the characters remotely resembled the anime selves, in looks or attitudes. Even just as a movie it fails. Its like something an 8 year old would love. I wont even say 9 because my 9 year old brother watched my burned version and he hated it!Terrible acting from everyone, except Fat. However I wont defend him; he choose to do this because he had no money I'm sure. Another thing that ticked me off was in the scene where Chi Chi cant open her locker. Well first off you later find out she's a world class fighter so, couldn't she just rip it off it's hinges? Second off, Goku sees so he blows all the lockers away using his Ki energy, and Chi Chi doesn't freak out? She just replies, ""hey you used your Ki."" Even in the show, which had animals as people in it; everyone freaks out at how unreal it is when they use energy blasts.

In forums I've read people commenting that if this movie would have another title it would be a great movie. What a mistake.

The other actors, are just, well, way over the top and a little too much when it comes to overacting. I mean, I haven't seen this much overacting since the opening scene of ""Mortal Kombat."" Anyways, and Justin Chatwin?! What?! Why?! Oh, yeah, that's right, Dreamworks has Shia so Fox has to have their ""it"" kid at the moment, and I guess that kid is shaping up to be Justin. Well, good luck. But not for a single second will I buy a kid that looks like him having a name like ""Goku."" *sigh* And the fight scenes -- Are you kidding me?! I mean, they jump up, and while in mid-air they slow down, turn sideways, and spin around and around and around like a screwdriver and launch themselves at each other. And then they land. Yikes. Normally, scenes like this are okay because all they do is require you to suspend your disbelief. However, in this case, it requires you to suspend any and all brain function.

And let's not forget the synchronized explosions. One after another, they all go off in a succession akin to that of a typical Power Ranger episode in which the Rangers stand victorious, facing the camera, while the evil monster cries in agony in the background and explodes setting off a massive fireball along with several other explosions that just happen to come out of literally nowhere.

Yes, we all know that ""Transformers,"" a movie that was based on a line of toys (no, serioulsy) was a massive success. The movie had a basic stock plot that didn't take much brainpower to muster up -- I'm a teenage kid that can't get the girl! I find magic robots! They fight evil robots! I have to help the magic robots get a magic cube! I got the cube! The evil guys are defeated! I got the girl! The end! Exclamation mark! So Fox seeing the success of this decided to tap into their own Japanese treasure chest and bring to life ""Dragonball."" Sad to say, it seems like they would have had better luck with ""Transformers"" because, unlike ""Dragonball"" which has an actual backstory to the characters, a bad ""Transformers"" movie would have illicited a response of sympathy from those that hated the movie, ""Hey, it's based on toys. That's the best they could have done."" With ""Dragonball"" and the gazillion manga volumes of it, along with the anime, there is no excuse if movie's story, characterization, or fights fail. No excuse. I mean, it's all right there in front of them. Hopefully, they did their homework. From the looks of it, no, it seems like they didn't."

When I first heard about the movie, I decided not to watch it because I thought DB is way beyond any live-action adaptation (all the fans know why). When I saw the trailer I was however surprised by the movie makers' creativity when I saw a Master Roshi with silky hair fit for any convincing shampoo ad. I knew instantly that the movie team is gonna surpass 'Citizen Kane', 'Shawshank Redemption', etc. easily. I knew that the movie would be too intellectual and too realistic for a stupid idiotic DB fan fool like me. Some coveted jury members of Academy Awards even said that they wanted a realistic movie so that they could relate themselves with Goku (just like Batman i guess). I am a hardcore DB fan and I too, like any other DB fan, would like to meet these 'beings' from Planet Vegeta (although I like DB but I am sane enough to accept the fact that Goku is an alien unlike the ones who want to relate themselves with Goku). Apart from these, 'Citizen Kane', hah, way too inferior than this masterpiece of this century. Right now I am waiting for at least 10 sequels so that I can send them to Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. They can make millions of copies, give them different names and drop them from air in countries like US and UK.

It got to be very concerning for me, as if not a single person in the cast or crew had ever seen a Dragonball episode in their lives. The script is so far gone from the original plot that I can not even imagine what must have gone through the writer's head as he composed this garbage. Surely he did not intend to further the gripping tale so timeless and successful that it sparked a decades-old franchise, so what might have been the reason behind this movie? It is a question that has offered up another question that I can not answer: how different can a licensed piece of work be from the original and still claim to be related?

In the original series Goku was just a little kid with a monkey tail having all kinds of wacky adventures searching for the Dragon Balls. Bulma had hair the color of a robin's egg, Roshi was older than the hills, and Chi-Chi was the princess daughter of an enormous beast of a man appropriately named ""The Ox King"". Apparently my inferior Earth logic can not comprehend the neural paths required to transform this series into a teenage high school drama. Teenagers should not even be watching this program anymore!

The first episodes to premier in America were in early 1996. Even if you were six years old when you got hooked on this show, where are you now? You are in college, still drinking illegally but well past living with your parents and trying to ""fit in"" with the ""normal crowd"". Even if you ARE in high school, you are five to ten years past watching anything decent on Cartoon Network, much less an episode of Dragonball.

My point is that the apparent target audience of this movie is Dragonball fans first and teenage drama fans second. The plot being as far removed from the original story as my car is from the moon, Dragonball fans will hate this movie. They will hate it and everyone associated with it. I am genuinely surprised that in the 8.5 hours (as of this writing) the movie has been out, someone has not been murdered because of the rage it creates among its rabid fan base.

If you have never seen Dragonball and have no expectations for this movie, go ahead and see it. You are the only people I could possibly recommend this movie to. However, you will be sorely disappointed by its lack of a driving plot, stunted length, numerous unanswered questions, and the fact that you will see no naked breasts on the screen. As a movie alone, it is still worthless. At no point did I find myself asking, ""I wonder what will happen next,"" but again I might be biased, the aforementioned rabid Dragonball fan that I am.

See this movie for yourself if you do not believe me, but please, do not see it in the movie. Download it illegally, for I will not live with myself knowing I furthered the popularity of such a disgraceful piece of trash."
1296,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"My expectation was really high when the news to make a Dragon Ball movie years back. I wasn't actually following the development of the movie since. And barely months ago, I seen the first trailer available for Dragon Ball Evolution. Oh man, you cannot belief my disgust. ""It's not a dragon ball movie"" screams my sub-conscious. For goodness sake, it doesn't even feel like Dragon Ball universe.

Alright, I have to watch the movie anyhow (admit being a huge fan of the series minus GT). In fact, I just returned from a showing in Brisbane, Australia. Okay, I went into the theater with little expectation. Yet I was willing to bet on the tiny little possibility that I will like the film. I was like ""please.... let there be a little thing that surprises me, let there be something DBZish that I can relate to"".

Let me set the record straight. I was TOTALLY DEVASTATED.....

It's almost like watching yet another teenage movie, except DB characters names were used. It was like watching kung-pao and said it was a set in the ""crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" world. (mind you, I actually enjoyed kung pao).

I think Dragon Ball Evolution will eventually become a page in history of ""what's not to do with manga"". A earlier reviewer said ""DB evolution was created for people who hate DB"". I saw that comments before watching the movie, and now I totally agrees with it."

1301,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"I'll keep this brief.

Those who aren't familiar with the Dragonball mythos will most likely be confused by this film. Despite the many changes that the creators of this movie made to the narrative, it relies heavily upon an assumed pre-existing knowledge of the franchise on the part of the viewer.

Those who ARE familiar with the Dragonball franchise will get to experience the joy and warmth of a cherished childhood narrative being simultaneously raped and defecated upon. Case in point: the creators were obviously trying to cash in on the success of Transformers through Goku's remodeling as an angsty high school student who also happens to be sooper speshul (not a theme exclusive to Transformers, obviously, but the plagiarism is hard to ignore here). He's a horny, frustrated, manipulative young man who cares more about getting a kiss from a girl he barely knows than saving the world (this is illustrated quite literally during his attempt to master the kamehameha technique).

I'm only a casual fan of the original series, but oh ye gods this is a terrible movie."
1302,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"Where to start... hmmm

First of all, i think we all know what Dragon Ball is. I watched it all the time when i was a kid. When i saw the trailer for this movie, i knew it was going to be bad, but after seeing the actual movie, it was worst them i thought.

What is bad:

1) A complete different storyline (but we all knew that)

2) Bad actors

3) Bad scenes, introductions to story parts etc

4) There's almost no fight at all in this movie (really)

5) To many kis? I mean are those kis? Are those kamehame? They light stuff? wow amazing...

6) The special effects are terrible. They look like Adobe After Effects

7) The oozaru... LOL

8) The dragon... LOL is that Spyro?

9) The final fight scene is ridiculous

10) The ending is more ridiculous them ridiculous

Now the good:

1) Hot girls

2) Wait... there's actually seven dragon balls in this movie!!

3) Oh my! There's a guy called Son Goku! Just like in the anime!

I advice you to not, TO NOT see this movie. You already know its bad, but you have no idea how bad it really is. Stay away from this, stay home, eat some chips and watch whatever is on television: its way better them the movie. If you watch this i bet you will regret it, like me."

I came in with low expectations, but, wow, i was just blown away on how terrible this movie is. The acting was awful, chow yuan fat looked foolish and could be his worst acting i've ever seen from him. Every other actor looks like they have never seen the show before because their characters are way off. I know they tried to americanized this movie by changing the settings, but it just didn't work out at all.

The effects were OK, but nothing ground breaking and nothing we've not seen before.

So in conclusion, please do not watch this movie. The acting is so horrible and its absolutely nothing to do with the anime, except the names. oh man, i was so furious when i walked out"
1306,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"First off, I was not one of the automatic pessimist's that tackled this board at the first sight of the film being produced. I had very high hopes for this movie, and well, it just didn't deliver. Being a huge fan of Dragonball ever since I was 10 years old, I was extremely excited to watch this. At the beginning of the movie, Goku cracks a lot of corny jokes, which really gave me the feel of the anime. Dragonball the anime was always full of terrible jokes so I thought maybe Wong did this on purpose. However, after venturing farther into this movie, I think it was an accident. James Chatwin may be the worst actor in the business after this movie. In some parts he reminded me of William Shatner when he was Captain Kirk on Star Trek. Also, the fight scenes maybe lasted around 2 minutes tops. I mean really Mr. Wong, what the hell were you thinking? It hurts me to say this movie sucked, but there's no better word to describe it. If this movie got a new director and script, then a sequel is very possible. Character development is key in Dragonball, and this movie had none whatsoever. So don't go into this movie with your hopes up. Instead, be optimistic that someone else will pick this script up and re-vamp it for a better, clever, and more violent sequel. It is possible, but right after seeing this horrible adaptation, my hopes are not high."

The only movie worse than this is Transformers the last knight.

I can't believe I can't rate this a 0.

What's funny is the people that rated this 2-6 also hatred it they're just too nice to give it what it deserves. I clicked to read into the reviews cause I couldn't understand why anyone would rate this higher than the lowest possible rating.

I doubt anyone even watched one episode as over half the names are pronounced incorrectly.

Super is out and that's great as well. Akira Toriyama's mind is amazing for what he has done. If anyone thought this movie was his doing, they would be naive and haven't truly seen the series. This is an atrocity to all that is Dragon Ball. Acting is mediocre at best, the script sounds like it came from a 10 year olds dream when they try to make it cooler than it actually is. No one in this movie even resembled any of the characters from the series (Even though they FORCED it with Goku's hair) except for Yamcha, that's EXTREMELY agruable.

1313,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"I'm not a Dragon Ball hardcore fan, but the main reason that I'm writing this is because there's a lot of positive comments saying ""Absolutely Good Movie"", ""Creative and Clever Story"", ""Honestly not bad film"" or even ""Why isn't part 2 coming out?"" (left by a guy who blames those who tell the truth of that movie), etc.; and I'm worried about IMDb being sued for false advertising if it is left there. This movie is only fun for yourselves if you've been smoking some particularly strange and illegal substances.

Dear God, this movie stole from Star Wars, The Matrix and The Last Airbender! In short, DBE makes the Taiwanese version of ""Dragon Ball"" (1992) look like a Greek tragedy in comparison. Yet it still ignores the source material. The CGI is crap, the special effects looks taken out from the Power Rangers, the dialogue makes Batman and Robin look thoughtful, and the characters... Goku is about as emotionless as a bag of rocks, and Yamcha looks like ""a tiger with Down syndrome."" This movie works as an insult directed towards Akira Toriyama and his fans...and directed by James Wong.

For this example, I will be using a well known story, ""The story of Jesus Christ"", but I will do to Jesus' story what the writers did to Dragon Ball:

Jesus Christ was born in California and went to Henry Austin High School. He used to get bullied growing up. His mom, Mary was a full time nurse who never had any time off. Jesus had some powers, but kept them hidden from everyone. One day Jesus went to a party. Everyone was complaining about there being no alcohol. Then Jesus used his power to turn every beverage in the fridge into beer. Then everyone thought he was super cool and got drunk. Suddenly Jesus was now the cool kid in school.

You get the idea. But this is how bad they butcher the DBZ story. Just, kill this movie please. No redeeming qualities whatsoever. Avoid this movie at all cost.

P.S.: For all the positive reviewers, ladies and gentlemen, Billy from SAW is waiting for you in the next door theater, and he is pleased to present a sissy and rather bad anime named ""Super Doll Licca-Chan"" (WARNING: This anime show *for little girls* will make a permanent brain damage). As you watch this anime, and in the locked theater, you will try to survive to find the key, while Billy will release poisonous gas and after will set ablaze the theater. So, live or die...make your choice."

In the movie Goku is the skinny young man (we have already seen that the movie will be bad, because the choice of lead actor was desperate), which has two problems. The first is that it bullied at school, what else is in love with the girlfriend of a guy who mistreats him. The story we've all seen a hundred times. Further course of action can be assumed. It easily beat the bullies, becomes charmer, and gets the girl. Yet finds out that his grandfather killed Piccolo. Then he tries to destroy Piccolo and save the world.

1316,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"One thing about doing a live adaptation of a Japanese series is that the contents tied to the original series is often removed, and traded for changes that would hopefully strike a balance in appealing to the various different markets.This was where Dragonball : Evolution totally failed.

Not only did the movie lose its fans of the original series through the various changes made, it also failed to impress those who are new to the DragonBall name.

Dragonball : Evolution could be said to have no connection to the original DragonBall series at all, except for the character's design and name.In this case, the title ""DragonBall"" is merely used as a advertising tool, with non of the good points taken from the original series.

If you are a DragonBall fan, you would be disappointed.If you are not one, you would hardly be entertained.This movie failed to show seriousness, but couldn't provide the laughs one would have expected even when taken as a comedic film.

A prime example of a production train wreck that failed to live up to its name."
1317,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"As bad as Inspector Gadget and The Last Airbender are, they look like masterpieces compared to Dragonball Evolution. The TV series was very, very good, the movie was half-baked and bland. The only good thing was James Marsters, while he mayn't look exactly like Piccolo he at least tries to capture the essence of the character. Just a shame he isn't in enough of the movie to elevate it even more.

Why do I say that Dragonball Evolution is a contender for the worst live-action film for an animated TV series? The scenery and costumes are nice to look at, but the cinematography does nothing for me, the editing is shoddy and the lighting is dull. The special effects don't impress either, they do distract rather than enhance and it doesn't help that some of them are half-baked.

The film is also too rushed, and in all honesty I was left bored by the end, nothing really interesting in my view happens. The story is juvenile and predictable, the dialogue is terrible either being cheesy or due to the delivery very rarely ringing true and the direction is bland. The acting is nothing to smile about, Goku and Yamuka especially are complete disasters and show a complete lack of acting ability. Not only that, the characters here are treated in the most banal way possible and are difficult to like as a result.

Overall, a very poor movie. 1/10 Bethany Cox"
1318,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"Don't waste your time. Seriously.

I wouldn't even bother to call this an 'adaptation'. It's more like a badly written fanfic: you know, one of those really bad 'DB characters in high school' ones.

It was very fast paced and rushed, and I pretty promptly forgot most of the movie as soon as I was finished watching it (which I can only sum up as good fortune).

I won't try and echo what hundreds of way more in-depth reviews written here before me have already said. I'll cut right to the chase: Don't waste perfectly good money on this piece of trash. It's not even one of those bad movies that's good for a laugh. You'll probably just wind up confused and, if you're a fan of the anime, probably more infuriated than anything.

1322,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"I've read the full series years ago but I'm not a big Dragonball fan nor do I care very much how close the movie is to the books. However, I do care about whether a movie is good or not. It started out kind of OK with a fun training session between Goku and his grandfather (shades of Karate Kid) and not long after with a clever ""fight"" where Goku wasn't actually allowed to hit the bullies because of a promise. I had hope then it wouldn't be as horrible as the reviews and trailer made it sound. This hope didn't last long as things progressively got worse and more boring. That fight with the bullies was actually the best fight of the movie. The few others were badly shot (especially the lava scenes), unspectacular and short. The plot was a mess of clichés riddled with unexplained happenings. I'm still not sure what the villain's motivation actually was.

I didn't really care about the characters and the acting was nothing to write home about. I thought the guy playing Goku looked the part (even though he's not Asian) and did good until the last part where his acting was deficient. I thought the villain Piccolo looked cool (James Marsters always does a good intense villain) although unfortunately he doesn't do very much. The secondary characters were not particularly memorable, even Chow-Yun Fat hamming it up. With such an expensive movie (100 millions apparently), you would expect the special effects to be somewhat decent even though the rest might be lacking. Unfortunately,they were lacking in terms of quality, scope and awe factor. Too often, they felt low-budget or b-movie grade (witness a particular transformation near the end). If they had at least gotten the silly humor, the quirky characters or especially the fights right, it would have redeemed the movie somewhat, it would not have been such a loss. If you're a big Dragonball fan you are likely going to hate this ""evolution"", if you're not, you'll likely find it boring and senseless after the promising start. If your expectations are really low (and face it, they probably are), then you might find it somewhat entertaining. This is a poor attempt at bringing a potentially huge franchise to the big screen.

To the true Dragon Ball comic fans out there, do not expect the story or characters to have major colleration to the original.

What on earth was twentieth century fox thinking? James Wong is by far one of the most under-classed directors in the field, and they decided to put him on the Dragonball project? Has anyone looked at his movie history? He did the Final Destination movies, the first one was good but the rest were laughable. Also The One with Jet Li. To think that it would be really hard to make a movie stink with Jet Li in it. Guess what?...James Wong managed to do it.

Also, what on earth was he thinking with the cast list? Justin Chatwin? What has he done that is noticeable? Oh and Joon Park. He has done two movies in the U.S. He was a driver in Speed Racer and now he is doing Yamcha and Dragonball. He did the audition in shorts and a t-shirt and he was given the part...excuse me? How can a director make such a poor decision when coming to auditions? Emmy Rossum was a good acting choice, but what is the point of good acting if you also have poor duologue? The writer also, look at his history. He has done almost absolutely nothing. Basically what twentieth century fox did was take the worst of everything and everyone to try to make a movie for fan-boys/girls. Look out it turned out.

Now that I am done with the ranting, let me quickly summarize how this project should have been gone about.

For a director, they should have told James to take a hike and hire someone who actually has a good amount of experience. If it were up to me then I would put Zack Snyder on the project. The man is a brilliant director with a visual mind unlike any other. Look what he did with 300 and Watchmen. I could definitely see him doing the same for Dragonball. As far as the cast, it is simple, find people with experience. The cast of Watchmen was not very noticeable before the movie but they did great with this movie because the director actually cared about the movie when it came to auditions. For a scriptwriter, It is not a hard concept, find a smart well known scriptwriter and have him adopt from the Manga. James Wong just seemed too lazy to do any of this. Anyone who is not James Wong would have known all of this which proves how under-classed he is.

Do us a favor Hollywood. Redo this movie someday and tell James Wong to take a hike and do it right. Thank you for ruining this experience for me James, really."

Between some good action series (dark angel) and action movies (Fantasic Four) I thought Fox was going to do a good tribute. But no. This movie was terrible. Plot was changed deliberately it had almost nothing to do with the original saga. Fight scenes were good but minor and other than one or two cheap ""After Effects"" power blasts (won't reduce myself to call those abominations kamehameha or mafuba) the movie failed to impress me. Not only they disprespected us old-school fans, but also a great and very known Japanese singer Ayumi Hamasaki, who composed a song SPECIALLY for Toriyama and the movie. And guess what? Fox didn't use it!! Well they did, but only in stupid credits that song was fantastic for an action scene. What a joke!! If you want to see a good ""live action version"" of Dragon Ball, go with ""Forbidden Kingdom"" (Jackie Chan and Jet Li). Not really based on Dragon ball but on Monkey King (DB too so they have some similarity) This movie just doesn't worth it. Except three hot chicks and a fantastic (altough terribly misused)song by Ayu, there is nothing I can save nor recommend about this movie. Are you a DB fan? You can avoid this.

short and bad (really bad) , the movie was a pain to see , my girl went crazy , she was like ""men this is really bad"" and i was like , let finish it is a dragon ball movie hehe , but really it was bad , bad casting , bad actors ,yun-fat chow was the only actor that i fell was more or less good ,Justin Chatwin acting was terrible , with all the respect he don't look like a warrior or a action actor ,its an American dragon ball but everyone is Asian except justin chatwin. WHY???. there's not much fight scenes , is a action movie what the...... is James Wong thinking (i like ""the one"" with jet li he was the director but ""the one"" was really short like dragon ball).

don't , i say it again; don't!!!!! waste your money in that movie , the economy is bad , so if you like to see a movie , go and see other movie because if you see this movie you will be sad ergo you will fell like you just trow your money to fire , or the theater rip you off."

If you watch it as a standalone movie and just forget about the ""adaptation"" word you will like this as some average American b-movie. I love Dragonball very much and have complete all its anime and manga and I know this is a bad-adaptation. I know too a lot of IMDb voter never watch this movie, they just give 1 star just because of its cast choice.

1340,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"7/10: Good

People make it out to be one of the worst movies ever. I have to say though, I've seen worse. (Then again, if you compare any movie to 'Birdemic,' it would make it look like it was worthy of an Oscar.) But the fact is, the reason I give a good review is because I liked it. But the reason was because I did what most people didn't do.

I DIDN'T take it seriously.

The reason: because of Stephen Chow. If that name sounds familiar, he's the writer and director of 'Kung Fu Hustle' and 'Shaolin Soccer' (both of them are movies that have a 7 out of 10 ratings on this site). He is also the Executive Producer of this movie. So you should not take this movie seriously. And why would you? If you were offered to do a Dragonball movie, would you really take it seriously? Would you? Really? The reason for the deduction of points, instead of giving it a 10, meaning, the only critique I have, would be the fact Goku is Caucasian. Now, some say it's a non-issue and that anime characters tend to look Caucasian. But it's really because he doesn't blend in with the other characters. Everyone else looks like their role, except him. But because of the argument about anime characters looking white makes it a reason enough why I'm not deducting more points. (And I also think the actor did a good job for his role).

James Marsters as Piccolo was amazing, and him being Caucasian didn't matter because he's an alien and he has make up on.

I was also surprised on how good the visuals were for a movie that barely made the status.

Over all a well enough movie to be some what appreciative. I certainly plan to buy this movie.

Just remember though, going into it, here's my final word of adviceDON'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY! NOBODY WHO MADE THE MOVIE TOOK IT SERIOUSLY, SO YOU SHOULDN'T EITHER!"

This movie is good one to watch on HBO or rent for a dollar at the r box. If there is nothing on then I would watch this by myself late at night.

simply put, i went into the movie expecting it to only share a few ideas with db. at best it wasn't db at all and i was hoping to enjoy just a decent movie that was completely standalone. i find that this movie lacked in developing a story, lack a good story period. poor character development, lack of clarification of the elements in the story. poor acting. i felt that the acting was rather amateur as if they were trying to remember their lines or reading off cue cards. the fighting choreography was horrible. music was mediocre. i'm not even upset that the story is butchered, look at other anime's or classic comics etc. there is always those extra stories or movies or etc that come along and make no sense with the story and maybe even butcher up the character but its still an awesome read/watch. this movie was not. i'm amazed that they're working on a part 2. i hope the writers will do the right thing and instead of just profiting off the name sake i hope they actually make a good story no matter how much they deviate from it and find better acting talent and directing overall."

It was hard to even laugh at it cause it was just generally bad. There are a few quotes and some visual effects that I found really funny, but they lasted only a few seconds and that is all.

At the moment I can't imagine what kind of tragic loop hole in the studio fiscal numbers could have prompted them to do this but I pose the question; why Dragon Ball?!! If for some reason this film was the result of poor research and disregard for authenticity, then both Ben Wong and mainly Ben Ramsey should be stung up by their feet and pelted with bile and human waste. It doesn't even help that they added evolution instead of Z which would have really spawned a violent reaction from a large fan community. Hands down, already one of the top 4 worst film adaptations ever made. Don't waste your money or time on this slovenly ball of Hollywood horse manure. I still don't know why or who gave this film the green light. I mean GOKU IS CAST AS A WHITE TEENAGER IN HIGH SCHOOL!!!! That to me is an indication to forget this film ever existed. This is definitely a bad move for Dune Entertainment. I'd say try the Wolverine film instead of this crap. But even so, why have any faith with the same group the messed up Max Panye, and made X-Men 3. Ha! I don't care if they read this, they need to anyway.

The characters don't look anything like their cartoon counterparts and it seems to be blatantly obvious that very little, if any, effort was taken to rectify this. To lay more emphasis on my previous statement let me give you one example, Yamcha's most distinguishing or noticeable facial characteristic, the scar was missing.

The writers have done a pathetic job, I seriously doubt if they have even seen the anime and I would like to summarize the director's role with just 2 words 'utterly disgraceful'. The storyline is a joke (not the funny kind either). The fight sequences were just lame and the worst part is that, it seems that nobody took the little effort required to make this movie even bearable.

As a dragon ball z fan, I have to say that I actually consider this movie to be nothing short of a disgrace to the dragon ball series. I still can't believe that someone is even willing to put their name on this train wreck.

If you are planning to watch this movie or due to sheer curiosity are thinking ""exactly how bad can it be?"". Take my word for it, expect the worst and it still won't reach your expectations.

1371,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"""Dragonball: Evolution. The movie made by Fox as a live action adaptation of the popular anime series Dragonball.

Now, I knew what I was getting into when I stepped into the theater earlier today, but that didn't stop me from being enraged at the blasphemy that unfolded in front of me. I know this review will be a little biased, as I am a Dragonball fan, but let me start off by saying that this movie is TERRIBLE. Fox really screwed up on this one. It doesn't even seem like they tried at all. Now, lets review the movie piece by piece.

Plot: Fox had an entire wealth of story an characters and everything to go off of t o make this movie. What did they do? They tried to make their own story. they failed. Horribly. Let's address the length. 1 hour and 10 minutes roughly. Movies now adays are usually an hour and a half to 2 hours long, but AN HOUR AND TEN MINUTES. That's not near long enough to get any of the story to Dragonball out.

The movie went way too fast. There was virtually no time for character development. Scenes moved way too fast, the story went too fast, and overall the movie was too fast (which could be a good or a bad thing).

The story itself. It just doesn't seem like Dragonball. the plot just seemed like generic action movie. You could've replaced all the characters and it would've made just as much sense. There were so many flaws and inconsistencies with the actual Dragonball story (way too many to write about right now). Any Dragonball fan will just be asking Why? the entire time. Also, Goku going to high school. WTF?! Let's just move on

Characters: Let me just get this off my chest, JUSTIN CHATWIN IS NOT GOKU, AND HE NEVER WILL BE. Now, Goku's character, if you've never seen the series, is basically happy, dumb, and doesn't know the ways of the world. In the movie, however, he is typical anxiety, smart-ass teenager. The character is nothing like Goku in any way shape or form, physically, or in behavior.

Next character: Bulma. Again physically looks nothing like Bluma. They put one streak of blue in her hair I guess to make people tell that she's Bulma. Since when can we not give characters colored hair? Seriously, what the hell? She seems like much more of a bitch than she does in the series. Not much character development there.

Master Roshi: Master Roshi is supposed to be a perverted old man who teaches Goku the Kamehameha. He teaches Goku the Kamehameha, but he is in no way the Master Roshi I knew.

Chi Chi: Goku's love interest. Since when is Chi Chi the popular chick? Other than that she just seems like a generic love interest.

Yamcha: First of all, he's blond. WTF? Second of all, they actually got this character pretty good, voice and all. It just doesn't match the look of the character. Also, WHERE'S THE WOLF FANG FIST?!

King Piccolo: All I can say is, Space Voldemort.

Mai: Just a random villain character because I guess they couldn't pick out any of the other various villains of Dragonball.

Overall, the characters just have no uniqueness to them, none of that special Dragonball flavor that they're supposed to have. None of the characters seem like themselves, with the exception of Yamcha, and there's virtually no character development.

Special effects: The special effects are very low grade in this film. The ki blasts look okay. The Kamehameha does not look like a Kamehameha. Piccolo looks like Voldemort. Shenlong looks like a generic dragon, and doesn't speak. Oozaru looked horrible (too small, and Goku didn't have a tail in which to transform).

I'm sure I left out a lot, but I just don't feel like typing about this anymore. If you're a Dragonball, fan do yourself a favor and don't see this movie. Watch it online if you just HAVE to see it. This movie is NOT Dragonball, only in names (which they surprisingly got right). Overall, terrible movie, and will never see it again. Also, they are actually making a SEQUEL!! WHY?!?!?! No......just no. Fox, you've already ruined it. Stop beating the already dead, burned, chopped up, and run over, horse."""
1372,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"OK I'm reviewing this while watching it so Yeah apologise for the ruff edges , my main issues with this movie is not the casting however it is an issue , its the apparent disregard for the story there are massive plot gaps previously cover'd in the show like Gokus grandpa being killed by piccolo instead of being killed by Goku when he transformed , Goku not having a tail etc.. stuff like that , if you've ever watched the Dragon ball , or Dragon ball z then this movie will aggravate you the the point of migraine

Now lets move to the casting issues lets start with the Pros: master Roshi , Yamcha and even Goku to and extent are played surprisingly well and keep to the shows characters Roshi is a dirty old pervert , Yamcha is a money chasing scoundrel , and Goku is the good guy pure and simple

CONS : and these are the real bones to pick Chi chi , Bulma & Piccolo are played ridiculously badly they have no Clue what there doing it feels to me that James Wong (director) watched like 3 episodes and said yeah lets butcher this , Bulma is flat there's no real spark from her no chemistry with Goku or Yamcha , Chi chi is some teenage cheer leader type doesn't really come across as the warrior princess from the show & Piccolo Ah where to begin Using James Masters just didn't work he just doesn't have the presence required to play such a Strong character his performance just came of as weak and not very engrossing.

Now that weave got that out of the way i can tackle the Movies flaws as a whole most of the movie as drawn out with very little action , some shallow references to stables of the show like the Kame Hame ha etc... but to me it's missing way to much to even call itself a dragon ball movie so Manny characters don't make an appearance such as , krillin Goku's best friend , Tien , ChuSu , Mr Po Po , Corin the list goes on and for a move called dragon ball it cant quite decide when its taken place its seams to jump and take elements from later and try and mix them , for example goku is 18 in this movie and in the show by that time he has met Bulma ,Yamcha,Master Roshi and beaten the RR army and defeated king piccolo were in this hes had an uneventful childhood as soon as he reaches 18 all manner of crap happens also in the end battle when you expect to see a excellent fight sequence your instead treated to Goku's supposed transformation in to Ozaru in the show a Giant destructive ape in the movie a guy that badly needs shaved .

in conclusion and i apologise for ranting , but i grew up with these shows and it really aggravates me when directors bastardise them like thieve done here , I've waited for years to see this show brought to the big screen and to see some of the epic sagas play out with real actors and see what a Hollywood budget could do to improve a beloved franchise ...., if this movie is anything to go by Not a frigging LOT if your a fan of the SHOW then for your own sake AVOID this Luke warm Puddle of excrement calling its self a movie ."

1374,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"Anybody who is a fan of Dragonball will be extremely disappointed with this movie. Even if you aren't a fan, this movie is still just awful. The story has absolutely no structure, and does not even have the slightest resemblance to the series it is supposedly based off of.

I watched this movie, and being a fan of Dragonball. It was painful, that's the only way I can describe it. The story is extremely cliché, and the plot and theme is less than mediocre.

Being an avid fan of the series. It is hard for me to say this but, this movie is a 1/10. They did not follow the story of Dragonball, they simply took the Title and the Names of the characters.

I can honestly say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Or it is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I am shocked to hear they want to make it a trilogy.

What a shame, and what a disappointment."
1375,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"If you think that i am gonna start ranting about how god awful this movie is and why you should not watch it in a theatre then you are wrong because that comes after i tell you why that it sucks so much.

This movie is based on the adventures of Son Goku in the world of DragonBall. Toriyama Sama created this epic. he said that this was a manga (Graphic Novel or comic book) that he had been waiting to write for some time. He had already enjoyed success with the popular series Doctor Slump and Aralie Chan. It took 3000 plates(boxes in pages) and 6 years to complete. the series had 148 fights and more than 1 hundred characters.

DragonBall was loyal to the fans, in its Anime Master Toriyama himself drew the characters. Even in the Video games the talented Toriyama Sama himself designed the 3D characters which stand true to the source.

DragonBall has set a standard of quality that its fans have come to expect from it and when DragonBall Evolution was announced most had a mixed reaction as the previous 2 adaptations had not been very good perhaps due to the budget. FOX put a lot of money into this project that could put Dragonball on the big screen for the world to see but which it did the only problem is that apart from the name Dragonball and its characters at FOX's disposal there is no resemblance to the original series.

I had a bad feeling in my gut 9 months ago when we found out that Toriyama Sama has been left out of the project for some ""plot changes"" that was when things started getting ugly and as we found out more about it and now its finally here. Despite of amazing DragonBall concept of Toriyama we get a washed up cliché based typical American teen highschool crap that has been done like a million times and done better. This movie does not satisfy the DragonBall fans or typical movie fans because all FOX wanted was to cash up on the sifi superhero thing that is popular these days. To them DragonBall and all other such manga are just labels that attract an audience they feed off the financial value of it and then just move on. DragonBall has a strong fanbase consisting of people from all ages and parts of the world. FOX has let us all down by giving us this mockery of a classic, alas they could have earned millions if they had done it right but they still can if it is remade with improvements such as a BETTER DIRECTOR and Triyama back on the team so that FOX can really make money off of it which is fine if would just stop this trilogy from happening to us.

I score it 1 out of 10"
1376,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"The runtime is 1 hour 26 minutes. It is undeniably short and so you cannot expect some fantastic plot but non-stop action and some good action scenes. I would say that Dragonball has achieved being a mindless flick with non-stop action. But I must say I am a little disappointed with the action scenes and how short it is. First thing, the action and fighting scenes-they are messy and short. One fighting scene runs about 3-4 minute and they are not that fantastic. There is nothing special about the fighting scenes as some of them look messy. Even the final battle is short. I feel that it is quite short and if it is true that it cost US$100 million, it is very expensive. The special effect is not that awesome that makes you go ""Wow!"".

The story: Yeah, as expected, the story is truly simple for all ages to understand. The strong point of Dragonball is supposed to be the fighting scenes but they are disappointing. The story is about Goku going on an adventure to find the seven hidden dragon balls after his grandfather tells him to before his death. From there, he needs to find master Roshi and some others company them on his quest to find the dragon balls before evil force finds them. As usual, Brian Tyler 's music is good and epic. His music makes the film more watchable.

Overall: Kids will like this non-stop action adventure and the adults, depending on their taste, might also enjoy it. I have to say that I don't know much about Dragonball so I enjoyed the fun ride. Those looking for a mindless flick, may be interested in it. Those who hate plots that are lame and messy fight scenes, this may not suit you. It is slightly better than average."

Are there no Asian actors that can speak English? Given a huge sum of money to make a movie, the first thing they should do is find a good group of talent to make the movie, no?

Multi-colored fire = energy? How sad.

This movie's producers really need to benchmark successful attempts like (discounting the obvious Batman) X-Men, HellBoy, Matrix, OldBoy for transitioning from anime presentation to live action presentation.

All was totally changed, so much that it seems another Karate Kid movie: - the surroundings resemble 3/4 of the screen time a typical American neighborhood; - Goku is a pacifist-socially clumsy American-like teenager that wants to fit,'be normal'and know girls, but he is bullied at school by the super-clichéd group of tough & cool bad boys; - All the characters, minus the bad evil guy, are dressed and act like they have been taken from a typical American High School movie.

Helloo film-makers, Dragonball is basically a Fantasy-Martial arts story!!! That's the least fans expect to see, not a covered up high-school story of a social loser that becomes cool.

Yes, I'm a fan that is complaining, irked and disappointed for the waste of such potential plot. Even if I saw the movie mentally prepared to accept a deep change of the story (that usually is not per se a bad thing, because it gives a different 'what-if' development that gives new life to the merchandise), I was appalled by the common clichés and lack of creativity.

So to sum it up: Unwatchable for the fan, poorly entertaining for the casual watcher, because of its unoriginality. Special effects and battles do not save the movie as they are mediocre and we've already used to see so much better."

1383,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"In all the interviews before the movie was released, James Wong, Justin Chatwin and even James Masters told us how much this movie will remained faithful to the manga and anime, but also with an added bonus such as the modern setting and the realism so that it looks like it is set in the real world. Thus, I had my hopes high.

Walking into the cinema, I sat down with my popcorn as the reel started to roll. A fast prologue explains that 2,000 years ago, the evil Lord Piccolo tried to destroy the world with the help of his monstrous demon, Oozaru and was only imprisoned by a brotherhood of mystics. The film then skips to present day, as young Goku spars with his grandfather. As a gift for his 18th birthday, Grandpa Gohan gives Goku a dragonball, briefly explaining that only seven of the balls exist and when they are united a dragon is summoned which can grant one perfect wish.

Okay, it still sticks to the original story. Fair enough.

But on the same day, Piccolo emerges, freed from shackles, with his lady assistant in an airship, trying to find the Dragonball. All the while, Goku is at a school party trying to woo his high school crush, Chi Chi when his grandfather is killed by Piccolo who couldn't find the Dragonball. With his last breath, Goku's grandfather tells him to find Master Roshi, who lives on a small island in the middle of town, and find the rest of the Dragonballs to save the world.

Okay, maybe some few changes. I can live with that.

Goku then went on a ""Wizard of Oz""-like adventure, where he seeks the Dragonball and meets a few friends along the way. At least the Tin Man, the Scarecrow and the Cowardly Lion have more characteristic and development than Bulma, Master Roshi and Yamcha.

Everything happened too fast. Goku had his training with Roshi on the way to find the Dragonball and learns the Kamehameha ""theorically"", because Roshi just tells him how to do it and in the final battle, he did it.

The actor that really (or, almost) lives out the character is James Masters playing Lord Piccolo. We can feel his anger and vengeful drive towards the Earth, though we still do not know why, or how he was freed. And unfortunately, he gets so little screen time that the movie-maker could have just use CGI and spare Masters from wasting his time. Chatwin was also a great actor and was a real Goku... if Goku was such a moody and one dimensional character.

But I guess what save the movie is the special effect and the storyline itself (which is from the manga; the ""Demon Lord Piccolo"" Saga). The special effect is really awesome (no where near Transformers or Watchmen, but still); everything looks real. From the background to the slow-motion fight scene and even the Kamehameha. And the plot was also entertaining, although it could have been done way better.

Dragonball Evolution looks like a very high-budget B-movie, or something straight to DVD or TV.

As soon as the movie ended, I was speechless.

But the there was a short scene during the credits. Stay if you want, but I know a lot of Dragonball fans would already know what it is.

Dragonball Evolution; recommended....if you have never read or watched the manga or anime and would like to just kill some time off the weekends."

The story was sloppy, the characterization absolutely ridiculous. The only thing I liked about the movie was when it ended. I hear 11 year old kids love this movie, and that just appalls me. I do NOT want the next generation watching this movie and thinking that this is what dragon ball is about!

It's wrong from the very basic - the story - all out of line. Nothing alike to the anime. The only common is the names. that's it. Nothing more... or.. or they are both sth you can watch on your little screen. I have never heard of a Goku going to high school, asking for the way flirting girls, and as far as I know, master Roshi is not that young :)). How disappointed it was for me (I guess it was as well for DBZ fan) when I see how they made our hero up like that... the more powerful Goku look, the more this Goku disappointed us. They have such an awful crew. I think they had never had a chance looking or watching at least an episode of this Dragonball series. EVER! ...

1393,Dragonball Evolution (2009),2.5,James Wong,"Firstly, this movie is everything it could have been: a ridiculous, cliché, poorly acted, completely nonsensical lump of a movie. The dialogue is stolen from every hero movie in existence, the acting is completely transparent and downright bad, the plot goes so fast and has no sensible path that it fails totally, the special effects are fairly boring, and the only good thing to say about it is that Chow Yun Fat is marginally entertaining.

Secondly, that's why I enjoyed it. This movie falls under the category of ""so bad it's funny"" genre. For anyone who has seen the anime, many of you know that Dragonball is the basis for much of the things Americans hate about anime. The dialogue is mundane, the characters look like creatures from some other dimension, and the plot makes utterly no sense. No one ever seems to learn anything valuable, nor do their motivations seem genuine. The characters simply exist to provide a moment of entertainment, which they normally fail to do. And this is why people watch it: Dragonball is completely adept at being inept.

In reality, I think that this movie actually intends to poke fun at anime and itself with how horrible it is. No one could take Dragonball into a movie and have it make any sense. Going into the movie, if you keep that in mind and know that it will be an hour and a half of pure stupidity, you might enjoy yourself. I certainly did.

yes, I am a lucky guy I never saw the original television animation series of Dragon Ball Z, so I had no expectations at all for this movie. a friend of mine wanted to see this movie and because I like movies too, he asked me to go with him. we already heard a lot of bad criticism about this picture, but he was a great fan of the series, so this film was a must see for him. I went too, because that's what friends must do: go take the good times, go take the bad, and take it together.

the movie started and he really was ashamed of bringing me to such BEEP, but I said 'hey don't worry, it's just a movie, I will survive this. after all, this isn't so bad.' and I was right. it wasn't as bad as Derek Jarman's 'The Garden', but it certainly wasn't as good as 'Monsters vs Aliens' (a movie I consider bad).

1400,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Just kidding...just kidding!! Why, after wasting nearly 2 hours of my life watching this trash, should I waste another hour or so dissing this movie, when everything about it has already been killed stone dead by previous reviewers? Because, dear friends, I am so excited I just had to share with you my delight at finding the ""worst cameo of all time"", so magnificent in its awfulness that it could (with sheer effort of will) only be equalled, but never beaten.

It was Sunday. Raining. What the hell, ""Bloodrayne"" sounded good. Hmmm, Masden, Kingsley, Zane...can't be so bad.

After around 20 minutes or so of this ""crowning turd"" of a movie my ""intellectual defence mechanism"" automatically kicked-in and took my mind away to my next vacation, what to have for dinner, and the contents of my Partner's trousers. Sailing away on a sea of serenity(did I actually fall asleep?)I thought myself immune and totally protected from the train wreck of a movie unfolding on the other side of my eyelids. But then....wait! What's this? Snippets of dialogue totally unconnected with the Tequilla Sunrise I was drinking began to pervade my mind. Slowly at first, but growing in intensity. Warily, fearful that I may inadvertently catch another glimpse of Ben Kingsley's excruciating acting/staring, I opened one eye. Was I seeing/hearing things? I pulled myself up in the chair and opened the other eye (after assuring myself that Kingsley was nowhere to be seen). There, in front of me...what can never be described by a thousand monkeys on a thousand typewriters for a thousand years. The root canal work of movie making, the Xanadu of awfulness....Meatloaf trying to character-act.

I checked out the other movie-goers...hmmm, not many left....and they were all, very much like myself, staring wide eyed and open mouthed at witnessing the birth of a legend. Seriously, it was like watching the first moon landing all over again. This is one piece of crap for man...a whole turd for mankind.

I am sorry that I go on a little, but I cannot find words to describe the cameo piece by Meatloaf, in fact probably such words do not exist - they must be invented - ""discrapungent"" - try that one. I can only try to capture the magnificent awfulness by describing the effect that it had on myself and, I suspect, the other viewers.

If you haven't seen it (and I beg you all to do so) cut along to any cinema brave enough to show it and set your alarm clock for around 50 minutes. If you have trouble sleeping at the beginning, don't worry, Ben Kingsley will stare you into blessed catatonia....trust me."
1401,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"When I heard that Uwe Boll had challenged several of his critics to a boxing match, I thought it was an example of the man failing to understand reactions. Rather than come out looking like a misunderstood hero, he comes off as a spoiled child. So when I hear people calling Uwe the new Ed Wood, I just want to point out that this demonstrates ignorance regarding Wood. It is insulting to the poor guy. You see, Wood made one of the most daring (if staggeringly inept) films that challenged people's perceptions of transvestism and gender roles, long before this became a common theme in Hollywood. His major feature was that he lived only to make films, and did so because of motives other than cash. Boll, on the other hand, says absolutely nothing in his films that is of any value, and has shown himself in the media to be the most cynical, thoughtless idiot that ever drew breath. Another classic example of the difference between Boll and Wood, perfectly illustrated by BloodRayne, is that Wood's films made narrative sense.

If you have not played any of the video games upon which BloodRayne is based, then it will make very little sense to you. The parts about Rayne being the child of a vampire and a human, I get, but the film is loaded with references to artifacts that the villain needs in order to gain power, which Rayne must obviously stop him from acquiring. This reminds me of the sequence from Bakshi's adaptation of The Lord Of The Rings in which the explanation of what the One Ring is and what it does was meant to be delivered. By failing to deliver this critical information in a manner that makes sense to the viewer, both films end up disjointed and pointless. Only BloodRayne makes it much, much worse by jumping around from location to location, showing confrontations between Rayne and various enemies without a pause for explanation as to why this is significant. Ten bucks to anyone who can figure out exactly why Boll chose to end the film with a bunch of flashbacks to disjointed events that have no connection to the film's ""present time"", when the climactic slaying would have done just fine.

Another of Boll's few talents is to classically miscast. Kristanna Loken is surprisingly good as the titular character, and puts in a far better performance than I would have credited her with after that abysmal Terminator rip-off. It is certainly far better than the film deserves. Michelle Rodriguez looks extremely angry to be there. Matthew Davis has this stupid expression on his face all the time that appears to be him begging for some direction. Michael Madsen, Billy Zane, and Udo Kier literally are on autopilot. But Meat Loaf, the poor guy, seems to be trying to take his role seriously, and never have I see an actor look so uncomfortable in his work. He almost looks as if he is going to have a stroke from all the ""what the hell am I doing here?"" instructions his brain is trying to process. But the real gem here is Ben Kingsley, winner of one Academy Award and nominee for three others. He seriously looks as if he is going to burst out in laughter at any second during his scenes with Loken. And who can honestly blame him?

A mention must be made of the abysmal special effects here, too. Boll at least knows that the audience for a film based on this video game expects to see blood, and a lot of it. However, like every other aspect of his films, the delivery is so staggeringly inept that it makes one wonder how Boll can be so blind to this. Not only does the head of one opponent look despicably fake, the looks on the faces of the extras when they are shown chopping things up with their swords is utterly hilarious. Someone had to direct them to assume that expression, as swinging an actual sword hard enough to sever a limb involves enough exertion that one at least pulls some kind of face in the process. They said it best in Showdown In Little Tokyo - beheadings are not as easy as they look. Yet Boll seems to think he can silence individuals who feel he is utterly inept as a director by hitting them. If I could say one thing to his face right now, it would be that keeping silent and working on making a genuinely good film would have worked a lot more.

So I mean it when I say this film is not as bad as many others have said - it is even worse. A competent director like Wolfgang Petersen would have connected the story together properly, and at least shot the violence in a convincing fashion. A brilliant director such as Paul Verhoeven would have found a way to satirise the social mores of the eighteenth century, and delivered enough convincing violence to give the MPAA fits at the same time. As much as Boll would like to pretend otherwise on the basis of sales figures in countries where they would probably not understand the abysmal dialogue anyway, he is nowhere near the league of Petersen or Verhoeven. And that is a big part of what makes his films so insulting to the general public. Boll would like us to believe that he is some kind of misunderstood genius who keeps striking out with critics because they do not understand his message. Well, Boll, the disjointed plot aside, I understand you just fine. The thing is, when I do understand your films, I do not want them anymore.

So I gave BloodRayne a two out of ten. A one would only further its position on the bottom one hundred, and it is deserving of infamy in neither sense of the word. Avoid."

The gratuitous sex scene was so completely sudden it seemed like an excerpt from a porn movie. The wigs are terrible, and the costuming as bad. There is no character development, and the motivations shown on screen seem more like red herrings than anything else.

I can't think of anything redeeming about this film other than I didn't pay money just to see it."
1403,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"This was, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I knew a little bit about the video game this is based upon going in, and while I can't say I was a fan or knew all that much about the story, I figured I was going to get a kinda Buffy/Medieval Times kinda feel. I was SO wrong. The acting quality that I had expected was not there at all. In fact, even Ben Kingsley, who I thought would be good (I've liked other things of his) was awful. Kristinna Locken was so emotionless that you wanted to cry from frustration. Michelle Rodiguez was the only one with some convincing effort, but even then, she couldn't pull her character out of one-dimension. Although, the actors didn't have much to go on to begin with. The dialouge was laughably cliché in parts and simply pathetic in others. It did NOTHING to help convey the characters emotions or thoughts, nor did it do well with explaining the story, trying for flashy and confusing explanations when simplicity was needed and other times being far too simple. All in all, this movie was horrible."
1404,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I almost forgot that I had seen this a month ago. I remember being excited more for the fact that Uwe Boll was in attendance so I could hear what he had to say about film-making.

Well, let's say his comments before and after the movie are revelations as to why he makes such crappy films. First off, he can't grasp why people savage his movies so much. He feels that the internet community gives him a hard time because he's German and he makes his movies with Nazi money (his quote, not mine. Of course, he was joking, right?) Secondly, he couldn't care less if the actors he has are right for the roles. In fact, finding actors is his last thing he does to secure financing for his films. Apparently, he thinks the story is strong enough to carry the film. So, this is why we end up with actors like Ben Kinglsey working alongside Michael Madsen. Really, the only thing they had was the time to do the movie and the earning of a paycheck. So, if this doesn't strike you as soulless film-making, I don't know what does. In essence, by waiting until the last possible moment to hire actors, he can make his movies with a secured budget.

Th reason why I write this is because I heard his new ""epic"" In the Name of the King will be a four hour film split in half like Kill Bill. This depressed me to no end. Uwe Boll really is the next Ed Wood, even though Ed Wood cared about his actors and films."
1405,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Where to start with this one? I'll point out that i watched it only because i heard that Kristanna Loken shows her boobies here. I didn't play the game nor have i known anything about the plot from that point of view. So i'm writing this solely on the movie experience.

I must point out that the movie has its good sides.

Most notably Ben Kingsleys horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE wig. I couldn't stop myself to burst into laughter anytime he was on screen. Its simply hilarious and worth the admission price alone.

Another good thing is the guy with the mullet (Matthew Davis). He looked almost as ridiculous as Ben Kingsley with a wig. By the way, I had no idea that mullets were that popular in 19th century Romania but the filmmakers sure proved me wrong. Maximum respect for the mullet Matthew, wear it proudly.

Of course you do get to see Kristanna Lokens boobs in a raunchy, makes no sense at all, sex scene so that also is a good thing.

I must point out that fight scenes, although they occur pretty rarely, are pretty rich with gore. They really surprised me there and i must say that i wasn't disappointed by that aspect of the movie. And you wont be either. Of course if you aren't into the bloody mess type of stuff the fight scenes will suck. But hey, who isn't into bloodbaths anyway? So some really good stuff there as well.

Now for the not so great aspects of the movie.

First of all the dialogs are completely and utterly, mind numbingly stupid. Its like a 6 year old wrote all the dialogs. The screenplay is very bad too. Think ""American Ninja 2"" in 19th century Romania when you think about the screenplay and dialogs in the movie. Really, really naive and infantile stuff there. Also they stole one ninja trick from American Ninja 2, you'll see it in one of the final scenes in the movie. I guess you could call it a homage to it though. Come to think of it, no, you couldn't. Its just plane old plagiarism.

Acting sucks too. Ben Kingsley just stares in the camera with his bad wig, Kristanna Loken does a lot of moaning and thats about it. Don't expect wonders from Michael Madsen either. Billy Zane does his thing regardless of anything, so if you like his style he could be acceptable. I like it.

Oh yeah, they have a MeatLoaf cameo. Now thats what i call weak. Then again, the topless babes in his scenes totally make up for his fat ass.

The director Uwe Boll isn't really that bad as people say he is. He gave us blood and tits, yes. And in a pretty good way, i might add. But he delivered nothing more. Blood and tits go without saying for modern day directors anyway. So i'll point out that he sucks as well but not as much as meatloaf.

Although this movie is really bad I'm not sorry i watched it. If you want watch it and if you'll appreciate the trashy aspects in the movie you wont be sorry either.

I'll give this one a 4/10."
1406,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Okay, I actually kind of liked this movie. Why? Well, as far as pure entertainment goes, I was actually entertained. I laughed at a lot of the acting and dialog, and the fight editing was a nightmare, but in the end, I still had a decent time with the movie. It gave me what I expected, but with some decent (and some really bad) acting.

Let's start with the Ed Wood pluses, also known as the ""so bad it's good"" material. For starters, Ben Kingsley. I have never seen such an accomplished actor do such a terrible job in my life! I couldn't stop laughing whenever he was on screen. I mean, it really seemed as if it was just a wax dummy of him set on a chair. His dialog was uber flat, and I honestly think they just got a sample of his voice and had a computer read his lines. But... he made the entire movie uber campy. It just felt right. Also, there is the clunky dialog. Some of the dialog does work, namely when the characters speak in more modern dialects, but when they try to get all old English or whatever the words become clunkier than a cart with square wheels being pulled by a man with no arms and legs. Michael Madsen also phoned in his performance, but it was ten times better than the ""acting"" he did in Sin City. And by the end of the movie I had very few problems with him. He did what he had to, nothing more. So, there are the bad parts. They seem minor, but oh are they major. Namely because they are all constantly apparent. One bad part that wasn't funny was the constant shots of people riding on horses. It got old very fast.

The actual good parts come in the form of a few things. For one is Michelle Rodrigez. She really, honestly tried with this movie, and came off as very credible. Her accent, her movements, everything... it just worked. She made this movie watchable. Also, the lead was very well played by Kristina Lochen (sp?). Her dialog is junk, but she can fight, and she plays the tough girl very well. And she looked the part. And Billy Zane, in a small role, is a blast to watch. He eats the cheesy dialog up, and you can tell he is enjoying himself. They should have given him more screen time! A big plus for this movie is the fact that there is actually a coherent story this time. Yes, actually story in a Bolle video game movie! It's not a great story, but it's a fleshed out, coherent story. Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead both were messes in the story department, basically moving from action scene to action scene. Here there is more time for characters to talk, interact. For any other director this movie would be a total disaster, but looking at Bolle's past video game adaptations I would have to say that he is improving in leaps and bounds. He's still not a great director, but he's getting better.

The usual problems come up though. The fight scenes are horribly edited, with some very bad film speed affects being thrown in. He needs to stop doing that, because he actually gets the fight angles right. He shoots from more of a distance, allowing the audience to see the action. Sadly the editing is so off, and some of the effects so distracting, that some decent action seems incoherent and choppy.

Over all, well, this movie is far from being good, but it does what it set out to do. It's actually about on par with the first Mortal Kombat movie. I am not a fan of the director by any means, but I have to say, I had no problem with this movie. I got a kick out of it. It has it's cheese value, and I knew that it would. If you go in expecting anything but pure cheese then you'll be disappointed. If you go in and plan to have a few laughs, crack a few jokes, and just enjoy the film, then you actually will have a good time with it. I know a lot of people are going to just breeze past this review, but I have to say, I have seen some REALLY bad movies, and this isn't one of them. It's got a decent plot, some good acting (and some REALLY bad acting), and it's got action.

I have a feeling that the Dungeon Siege movie will suck though. It's like... three fricking hours long! TO MUCH!"
1407,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"So women sometime before the XIX, but after the XVI century traveled alone on horseback, half-naked, always cold, carrying swords in their backs, and the cities were a model of pulchritude. Yeah, right. It does not even work as a metaphor. When the director wants to show us an evil character, there is a Ben Kinsgley with an over-sized wig remembering in black and white his cruel dialog: ""Tell me where is my damphir"" ""No"" says the mother. ""Tell me"" ""No"" Pum! Pow! The scariest thing of this movie is to see such potentially good actors in such lame dialogs. You will experience anguish as an spectator, as you feel other people's shame (the actors). Even if you like awful movies (sometimes I do), please do not waste your money in this one. The director might be encouraged to punish us again. I wish IMDb had negative stars."

1409,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,Warning: Spoilers
1410,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I've never seen the computer game on which this movie is based, so the reported discrepancies between the film's storyline and the game's original mythos (which fans of the game have been very vocal about) didn't bother me, and instead I just viewed the movie as a separate entity. While I can't honestly say that Bloodrayne is anything special, it's certainly not the complete disaster that it's supposed to be. There's no denying that several of the main actors are woefully miscast - Michael Madsen being the prime example - and there are some bizarre and distracting cameos from Michael Pare (whom I swear hasn't aged a day in the twenty five years since Streets of Fire), Billy Zane and Meat Loaf. But I still found Bloodrayne to be considerably more entertaining than Van Helsing (2004), the film it most resembles. In fact it's only slightly inferior to the similarly themed Underworld movie"
1411,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I'm already frustrated because the rating system only only goes down to 1 instead of -10....Because Uwe Boll has done it again! He has managed to make a completely god-awful movie, and has caused to me lose respect for the ""actors"" in this filth. Granted the only one that had my respect was Kingsley...well, not anymore. The non-existent ""story"" was worthless. There are actually ignorant people that LIKE this crap, and it's sad, because anyone who rates this more than a 1 is probably some 15-year-old kid who got off on that ""love scene"" that looked like it was straight out of a Ron Jeremy flick. Kristanna Loken's got the personality of used toilet paper, and Michael madsen...well....he just kinda looked like he was drunk..wouldn't put it past him anyway. The only reason why Uwe Boll is still allowed to make movies is because ignorant movie goers and the few fans he has defend him to the death, he is horrible and he should be barred from ever touching a camera again."
1412,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"OK, I am locking my doors as I write this but really people! Look I know the movie bombed, I know the director is a dumb nut but by sitting here and writing for two hours about how watching the movie was such a waste of time - you are only wasting more time! I am so sick of how reviews pick what you watch, play, and buy now-days! I thought it was a neat little movie!, A bit cheap and heavy on the phony blood but not that bad all around. What does make the movie look bad is when you jump online and read a huge amount of errors in the movie so you can be looking for them.I think that if I had just watched the movie it would have been good. Bottom line, watch something if you want to know what you think of it, don't let others witch and moan and keep you from getting your own opinio"
1413,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"After watching BloodRayne, I am thoroughly convinced Uwe Boll will eventually make a good and entertaining movie (five years from now at the very very least.) As Alone in the Dark was a step up from House of the Dead, BloodRayne is a step up from Alone in the dark. Unfortunately, before he gets there Boll will have to continue to trek through the vast expanse of mediocrity one baby step at a time, and there is far more entertainment from a shamelessly bad movie than a merely mediocre one.

The opening credits take place over a nice little montage of paintings, then moves to a sunset in the mountains effectively establishing the mood in a surprisingly competent fashion. I found myself entertaining the idea, ""You know, maybe  just maybe Boll finally made a good movie."" Then just like Alone in the Dark, the first actor opened his mouth and my hopes collapsed. I shook my head, sighed, then braced myself to endure another 80 minutes of performances downplayed to the point that they lack conviction. Vladimir (Michael Madsen), the seasoned vampire hunter and head of Brimstone, delivers his lines with a tone that implies he's been around and seen everything. As a free bonus, Madsen adds an additional quality: unenthusiastic boredom.

Kagun (Ben Kingsley) the old powerful vampire lord, having achieved demi-God status amongst mortals, spends most of his time sitting, standing, or walking. He takes action only in the ceremonial sense. Played to perfection by Kingsley who goes so far as to make his own appearance in the film seem equally ceremonial and equally inconsequential.

(Although one has to wonder if Kingsley and Madsen both went overboard in their performances, or if the editing pushed the performances over the threshold. Dwell on that for a moment, but don't answer.)

Domastir (Will Sanderson), Kaguns' henchman, forever has a crazed wide-eyed stare that lacked any sense of menace. It reminded me of that look pro wrestler gives during their pre-match smack talk rants (which I, try as I might, can't watch with a straight face) ,and from hence forth I saw Domastir as the little wrestler who couldn't.

As for Rayne, herself, Kristanna Loken does an admirable job of wanting to go somewhere with the role despite being trapped by a film that's lost. It knows where it wants to go, but doesn't know how to get there. She does what she can to explore the bloodlust and turmoil of vampirism (or dhampirism) even though the film she's starring in cares only enough to explore blood, blood, and more blood (a point hammered home by the final overly-long montage at the end.)

And then Billy Zane, Elrich, comes to the rescue. Zane salvages his role by going in the exact opposite direction as the rest of the cast. He opts for an approach reminiscent of his role in Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight, and gives two well timed blasts from the defibrillator to counter the rest of the film floating on tharzine.

More interesting, yet, is the scene with Elrich and Domastir face to face. When Domastir has a sword to Elrich's heart, staring as intently as ever like a crazed man obsessed with reading a name tag, Elrich pushes the lil' wrestler wanna-be's sword aside and dismisses the whole encounter like it was part of his Las Vegas illusionist's show where Domastir is hypnotized. Elrich and everyone in the audiences knows it's a joke, but Domastir remains clueless.

Gallons of gratuitous gore splatters the death sequences in direct answer to the growing number of PG13 films that should shoot for a hard R but sadly whore themselves to younger audiences. It's a nice thought, but it comes across as gore for the sole sake of gratuity to the point of goofiness. A direct contrast to BloodRayne's overly grounded (""grounded"" as in six-feet under) performances. Yet another indication, that Billy Zane had the right idea.

Budgetary and time constraints show up in the choreography of the fights and battle scenes, and even more so in the editing of said scenes. The fights seem curiously rehearsed like a stage-dance, and the swords (practice weapons aside) have unusually thick edges. Fair game for criticism? Eh, in places, sure. No doubt, though, that Boll bashers will target anything and everything not up to Lord of the Rings standards.

In my Alone in the Dark review I mainly focused my criticism on Boll's parasitic dependency on better films for material in his own to the point that Alone in the Dark cannot stand on its own without Equilibrium, Evil Dead, and the Matrix. BloodRayne is like a baby's first step, reluctantly letting go and making an unstable effort to walk  letting go of the blatant rip offs (""homages"" on steroids) and finding its own style.

Uwe Boll's not there yet, but he's getting there  one step at a time."
1414,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"That's right I said it. I'm starting the first official Uwe Boll fan club. I will be lined up (in a line consisting of 2 people)in front of our local theatre to buy tickets for the first show. I think the mistake that some of the posters have made is either not seeing the crap-tastic ""House of the Dead"" or the most unwatchable of his films ""Alone in the Dark"", or thinking his films will get better as he learns his ""craft"".

I was once like you, tricked into seeing House of the Dead only to be shat on for an hour and 35 minutes. But after Alone in the Dark came out, I discovered the blinding and wonderful truth of his films. Uwe Boll is a throw back to the great ""USA Up ALL Night"", staring Shannon Tweed and or Shannon Whirry, & generic slasher films of the early and mid - eighties. These films have a special place in heart for whatever reason. It might be because the represent a special part of movie making, the bad formula film.

He makes movies based on a formula, a proved formula. Get a known brand with a built in fan base. (in this case, video games that are past their shelf life.)Put this brand into a profitable movie genre such as teen sex comedy (I'm looking at you National Lampoon) or horror film. Wait to cast the film until the last possible minute in order to get as many ""name"" stars as you can for as cheap as you can. (suprise- many stars take rolls just for a paycheck or because the can squeeze it in between projects and collect a paycheck)Throw in gore/mind-numbing action and or nudity and you have yourself a film that will make back it's budget (between 10 to 20 million) worldwide before it ever sees DVD. Roger Corman made himself a name and a fortune doing this type of film making.

I'm not saying that his films are any good or even watchable at times. What I'm saying is that I crack the hell up every time I watch one. Enjoy them for what they are, Huge wastes of someone's hard warned money. I swear that I laugh more at these films than I laugh at films like ""Meet the Fockers"".

Do yourself a favor and rent Alone in the Dark and see if you can keep from laughing when the Tara Reid says New-found-land. It's like angels singing.

1415,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Perhaps this is because I expected NOTHING from this movie. This has been nothing but trash talked since it's first screenings. Personally, I was surprised. I found it to be entertaining. Don't get me wrong, it is not without its faults. Still, overall, I found it to be very enjoyable. Much of what I found disappointing in the movie did not have to do with the director, but with things that may have been ""out of their hands."" Ben Kingsley's performance felt completely uninspired. He may as well have been reading a cue card without punctuation marks. Michael Madsen felt somewhat out of place, but his portrayal as Vladimir was acceptable. Michelle Rodriguez, well, I just love her work. And Kristanna Loken did a very good job as Rayne. She seemed to actually care about the character. It may not have been an Oscar-winning performance, but she still played the killer with a heart believably (which, unfortunately, is not really who Bloodrayne is in the video games, but is acceptable for the sake of the script.) The script did seem weak at some points, and could have tied up a couple of loose ends, but overall it served it's purpose. For being a video game movie, it may not have been as good as ""Doom,"" but it greatly surpassed what had become the norm with movies like ""Street Fighter"" and ""Double Dragon."" Finally, I must speak about the director. I did sit through part of ""House of the Dead"" and simply could not bear it, though I really didn't give it half a chance. I expected a similar experience with Bloodrayne. Well, Uwe Boll, you have surprised me. His choice of camera angles and shots were interesting and had dramatic effect. He really does want to make a good movie. His efforts show through. I left the theater feeling pleased. There was some heart underneath this film. I am actually looking forward to his Dungeon Siege film, which was in the trailers.

So to recap, was it a great movie? No. Will it win awards? No. Was it enjoyable? Definitely. Would I watch it again? I don't doubt it. Perhaps in the end, it felt like a really good B-movie. If you watch this with the mindset the Uwe Boll is not a Hollywood director, but he does have a lot of heart, you very well may enjoy this film."
1416,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"During my tour through 'Garbage cinema', i stumbled upon BloodRayne, which is apparently a video game adaptation, and it is common knowledge that those are generally horrific failures. There is no exception in this case, as this is a laughable piece of work that seems to have an obsession with insulting the viewers intelligence.

The cast features some acclaimed actors in the form of Ben Kingsley, Billy Zane & Michael Madsen, which is an unfortunate stain on their careers. Kingsley was the epitome of the dead eyed emotionless underperformer, and much of the same is true with Madsen, who seems to hate being in this film for the entire duration. Zane tries his best to surpass the abysmal script with his acting, but alas, he does not succeed. None of the actors are able to use even the slightliest of emotional ranges, as all of them are incapable of showing a different facial expression. Since some of the actors cast in the movie are indeed incredible, it is obvious they too had little motivation and ambition for such a ridiculous project as this. Every single actor & actress's line delivery in BloodRayne seems like a literal cue card reading session, and the dialogue is insultingly bad. My favorite has to be: 'My companion has gone missing, i do not know what has become of him!!!' which results in one of the most insultingly stupid prison breaks ever filmed.

There is no character development. There is not a sequence in which the characters are set up. There is nothing that is told about the characters, and there is simply absolutely nothing that drives them. Rayne's mother was raped by Kegan and seeks revenge, which is the most insulting & cliché of motivations there is. It tries so hard to get the viewer to feel sympathy for Rayne because of this, but this cliché victim classification is in reality just horrid writing. It is a common feminist delusion that they always classify themselves as the 'Common victim' in every circumstance and this film is basically a propaganda show of political correctness in that way. However, when a film is this bad, its ridiculous PC themes don't even really matter, as nobody could ever take anything about this film seriously.

There are a couple of scenes where we witness the aftermath of some event, and director Uwe Boll thinks it is necessary to throw in a couple of disjointed, horribly edited flashbacks in which the viewer learns absolutely nothing else than what they already knew before the flashback. Something simplistic is spoken, and Boll deems it necessary to throw in a flashback because it seems like he doesn't think audience can understand it without it. It is a slap in the face of the audience's intelligence, and also a slap in the face of this film's already nearly non existent intellectuality.

While most of the cinematography in BloodRayne is sub par, it does have a couple of nice sweeping outdoor shots when characters ride through the country. However, it also features a lot of brightly lit forest scenes even though it is in the middle of the night & an obvious lack in color variation, as most of the film is grey and dark green. The original score, however, was very good, and these seem to be the only slightly redeeming factors of this snoozefest.

The many action sequences feature horrid slow & clunky choreography ( Especially Madsen, no idea how he managed to kill so many guys during this film when he is barely able to swing a sword ), and terrible editing. All of the actors in the film seem to be severely limited in athletics & choreography, and so this is hidden a bit by the fact that there are numerous amount of cuts and edits throughout the fights. The viewer can never see what is going on, or how the fight is turning out. Boll is only interested in showing protagonists kill people and trying to hide their clunky swordplay with his horrid quick editing which will probably damage your eyesight beyond repair. In the end, the film is a basic lesson in how NOT to film action sequences, as its choreography, editing & overview of the fights is just horrible.

BloodRayne has terrible acting, writing, choreography, editing, & characters. While some decent shots in its cinematography and an excellent original score make sure it doesn't wind up in the category with some of the actual worst of all time, it is still a sure contender for the places a little bit behind them."
1417,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"People are eager to pile on any movie panned by the critics. While I agree that Uwe Boll should be making low budget videos or used car commercials until he learns how to direct, this movie was not all that bad if you overlook some of its obvious failings.

The fact is, there are hundreds of low budget movies made every year that are much worse than this. Many have laughable effects, are more trite, with worse acting, sets and costumes. You can see them any evening on SciFi or the other basic cable channels.

The biggest problem with Bloodrayne may be that it attempts to be more than it is. Compared to most direct-to-video fare, it's not half bad. I saw it on TV, so I'm not comparing it to other major releases from big studios. I believe people are judging it based on their expectations as much as anything.

I thought Kristanna Lokken was pretty good. Fortunately, she plays the main character. She was a good choice for Rayne. Some of the other actors sounded a little silly trying to affect a vaguely European, old-timey accent, especially Madsen and Rodriguez, neither of whom seemed able to convincingly drop their notable Jersey accents."
1418,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Saw 'Bloodrayne' and its two sequels out of curiosity to see if they were as bad as their terrible reputation. As well as seeing whether one of the worst directors of all time Uwe Boll was capable of making a good film. On top of that, like Ben Kingsley a lot as an actor and he is reason enough to see anything he's involved in. Did not have my hopes up, because even looking at the advertising and trailers 'Bloodrayne' looked awful.

The terrible reputation and dubious advertising do not lie. 'Bloodrayne' to me and many others really is that bad, bad actually is an understatement. Have come to the conclusion that Boll is incapable of making a halfway decent film, have not seen everything of his but all that has been seen has been terrible and as bad as their reputation. As someone who is usually very generous rating and reviewing films, 'Bloodrayne' does stand out as one of the worst films seen recently and actually full stop. Everything is abysmally executed and there are no redeeming qualities at all, have said that about very few films seen recently.

'Bloodrayne' couldn't be more inept visually. Photography that is both chaotic and static, bacon-slicer-like editing, drab costumes that don't fit the setting, continuity errors galore (more than anybody can count), afterthought-like visual effects, lighting completely lacking in atmosphere, those can all be found. The music sounds cheap and is never dynamic with anything on screen, often working against it and like it belonged in another film entirely.

Writing is horrendously stilted and cheesy, enough to make one want to vomit and the unintentional camp later on becomes exhausting. The action has no momentum or excitement whatsoever, is chaotically edited, under-rehearsed choreographically and a lot of it is incomprehensible. It really takes ineptitude to a whole new level. As is the story, it never comes to life and is not easy to follow often. Boll's direction is typically non-existent and cold, comparing him to Ed Wood is rather insulting when although Wood's films were the complete opposite of fine heart one could see that he had his heart in the right place (something that has never been the case with Boll). The characters are walking cliches that are neither interesting or worth rooting for, instead bland and irritating.

You know something is wrong when the best performance comes from an angry-looking Michelle Rodriguez. Elsewhere there is an emotionless lead, Meat Loaf's uncomfortable cameo and Michael Madsen and Billy Zane going through the motions. Worst of it is Kingsley in his worst ever performance, taking hamminess and chewing-scenery-to-pieces to mind-boggling extremes.

Summarising, completely bloodless and appallingly awful. 1/10 Bethany Cox"
1419,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"This is another video game made to movie, if I'm not mistaken. The movie is under rated, in no point I got a feeling that I couldn't watch this. part of this low rating could be disappointed fans of the game, don't know.

The plot and everything in this movie is so unremarkable, that I cant remember almost anything of this movie anymore. The car chase scene was good, or was that in Underworld? Nevertheless there was one sex scene.

This movie has very good cast, take Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen and Kristanna Loken. Acting alone is worth 7 or 8 out of 10. Visual effects are worth 9 to 10. Plot and everything else doesn't matter. In no point of this movie did I feel any mental pain or thought ""I can't watch this."" I give this movie 6 purely on it's merits of not giving me any thoughts or feelings. Looking back on my comment it could seem as a negative statement about the movie, it's not. If you are tired after work, but don't want to go sleep yet because there is lot of sh't on you mind this could movie be the perfect solution."
1420,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I want to strike a blow for a movie that seems to be one of the worst movies, when you follow the ratings and verdicts here. But it's easy here to rate one star without watching a movie, and also without giving one thought to.

Of course it isn't an artwork, a masterwork, or comparable to high budget productions a la Lord Of The Rings. Instead, it fits right into a solid line of straight-to-video productions, or some bigger TV Adventure movies, but is definitively enjoyable for people who don't expect a lifetime experience from Uwe Boll. But at least, one have to respect the genre outside the Tolkien realm. If not, the movie has no chance at all.

It is a simple story about a girl that wants revenge for the killing of her mother by her father, who is the most powerful Vampire, and also wants to be ruler of the world. Kristanna Loken as Rayne does a good Job being sexy, powerful and filled with hate and blood hunger. The others are OK, and Ben Kingsley does keep a low profile, because he has not very much to do except being old Ben Kingsley.

Directing is not great, I admit that, it is at max, zealous. Definitevly it is better than in any of the infamous Asylum Movies i've seen, in terms of storytelling, actors leading and so on. The only one bigger mistake is that the short history of Raynes romance with Sebastian is revealed at the end of the movie, so that the short sex scene with him looks quite unfounded.

If there wouldn't be so much blood and gore, it could pass as a movie for youngsters. I remember watching such movies (of course without gore and without nudity), when I was ten or twelve."

1423,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"In eighteenth century Romania, Rayne (Kristanna Loken), a warrior woman, half-human, half-vampire , is the main attraction at a freak-show but she she gets to escape. Afther that, she meets a fortuneteller (Geraldine Chaplin) who tells his father raped and killed her mother. Then she sets out to revenge her mother's rape by her father, Kagan ( Ben Kingsley), King of Vampires. Three vampire hunters, Sebastian (Matthew Davis), Katarin (Michelle Rodriguez) and Vladimir(Michel Madsen), from the Brimstone Society persuade her to join their cause. Meanwhile, Rayne falls in love with Sebastian and prepares her vengeance.

This exciting movie displays unstopped action, thrills ride, spectacular fighting, graphic violence, and brief nudism with mild sex scene. It packs large amount of guts and gore , there's a huge body count, this one actually knocks off an immense amount, several vampires are staked bloodily in the chest, even more bitten with large dents. There's really savage decapitation, plenty of bodies ripped in scraps and half, including some of the most tears ever, that spill lots of blood . Most of vampires and humans victims are relegated to being bitten in the throat and neck. Magnificent special and visual effects as well as excellent make-up department. Bone-chilling and atmospheric musical score and colorful and dark cinematography ; furthermore spectacular production design .The motion picture is regularly directed by Uwe Boll . All four of the films he has realized that were based upon video games, House of the Dead (2003), Alone in the Dark (2005), BloodRayne (2005) and BloodRayne II: Deliverance (2007) were listed on the bottom of barrel by the reviewers. Most of the other films he's directed, including Heart of America (2002), and Blackwoods (2002) are not widely available in America, but have received similarly low ratings among those who have seen them. All technicians and some actors participate in the following : BloodRayne II with Natassia Malthe, Zack Ward and again Michel Pare, Uwe Boll's fetish's actor. Recommended to those who amuse those kind of vampire films or those enjoy in general.Rating : average though some moments is entertaining."

In the game is clearly states that Rayne is an American teenager in the years before WW2. So how can she be a 20-something Romanian? If your gonna base a movie off of something at least keep the Title Character the same. The costume is the same but thats it. Rayne Dry twisted humor is missing along with her ghost white skin.

""Bloodrayne"" is a great vampire movie and absolutely underrated in IMDb. The locations and cinematography in Romania are magnificent and I believe it would be impossible to build sets so spectaculars in another country; the cast is excellent, with Sir Ben Kingsley, Geraldine Chaplin, Michael Madsen, Michelle Rodriguez, Matthew Davis and the gorgeous Kristanna Loken; the story is full of action and the characters are very well developed. I have glanced many silly comments, but the winner is one that states that ""Kristanna Loken looks like a child instead of a woman"". Wow, this athletic actress is one of the most beautiful women of the cinema industry. Definitely this movie be included in Bottom 100 is one of the greatest absurd I have ever seen in IMDb. My vote is seven.

1428,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"The masochist in me has taken over and I've decided to sit through three movies from IMDb's Bottom 100 in a row to see if this kind of activity can cause permanent brain damage. My first stop is ""Bloodrayne"", Uwe Boll's third video game adaptation and, impressively, his least entertaining, interesting and fun movie so far. Whereas ""House of the Dead"" was so bad it had its moments of unintentional comedy, and ""Alone in the Dark"" was simply too empty and forgettable to count among the all-time worsts, ""Bloodrayne"" made me seriously consider killing myself before I had come half-way through. Why do I loathe this movie? Let me count the ways:

Direction: Truly mind-bogglingly sloppy and dull. Boll outdoes himself with constantly out of place camera angles and really unexciting action scenes. He's not called the modern day Ed Wood for nothing.

The actors: This is the biggest and most talented cast Boll has managed to bribe into one of his films so far. Michael Madsen, Udo Kier, Ben Kingsley and Kristanna Loken are just some of the people who have been hired to humiliate themselves this time. Madsen tries but he really only puts as much effort into his role as the script deserves - meaning, not very much. Udo Kier does his best comical evil-Russian-mind-controller á la ""Yuri's Revenge"" impression - too bad the film actually tries to be serious. Ben Kingsley is so monotonous it's clear he has nothing but contempt for the film - but what intelligent actor wouldn't? Loken... well, Loken looks good and acts bad, although I didn't expect much else. Some of the supporting actors are so unbelievably awful you don't know whether to laugh or cry.

The story: Not even worth mentioning. So I won't.

The musical score: Generic and overbearing, loud and completely out of sync with the scenes most of the time. Slapped on to the film by Boll not to enhance the film but because films are supposed to have one.

The effects: Very funny in an over-the-top kind of way, but certainly not scary. The guy who gets split in half is a laugh riot.

The film's main problem is that for all its idiotic dialogue and laughable acting it simply isn't entertaining enough. It's one of the dullest movies I've watched in a long time and before the 1 hour mark I guarantee you that you'll be bored halfway into a coma. Oh, and could the nonsensical, out of place sex scene be any *less* erotic, because I don't think I was quite bored enough at this point!

In conclusion: It's truly ""worthy"" of being in the Bottom 100. How fitting that the first vampire movie Boll makes is the one that sucks the most. My next stop in this marathon is the 1990 superhero movie ""Captain America"". Pray for my sanity."

I'm just ticked off that she didn't accept the role for Bloodrayne 2.Even though a movie that Kristanna is currently working on, A king's Tale, and even though it is again directed by our friend Mr. Boll I like Jason Statham and Ray Liotta.

To study the craftsmanship - sometimes breathtaking, sometimes laughable. To see what hidden levels of narration lies beneath the glossy crust. You know. Bloodrayne is so far one of two movies I could not endure to watch to the end. It was excruciating. I understand fully the critique against Dr Uwe Boll, how that person can even call himself a director is a farce at best. I must shamefully admit that I would have endured the movie if there had been the same protagonists as in the original video game - occult Nazis. (Since Raiders of the lost Ark, they're my favorites as bad guys go.) Now, we're treated to the same level of excellence as your average Buffy TV episode. Or, in the form of continuity, better. If you're considering watching this movie, take a long hard look inside and come to the conclusion it's not worth it. Please? I might even stretch to defending piracy for this one movie. :)

1434,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I just saw this movie today, the day it opened in my locality. And although I liked it alright, it really is one of those movies chock full of ""well that's good but"" features.

If you like vampire movies of the modern, campy, pop type ... think of Vampire Lestrat, and Blade, and even Buffy the Vampire Killer ... then this move may appeal. I've liked Vampire movies and stories since childhood and although I prefer ""old school"" vampires (like Dracula) I do think the modern ones of this kind have a kind of cool appeal as well.

The cast includes some enormously capable actors: Ben Kingsley, Michael Madden, Michelle Rodriguez. They, and the entire cast, produced solid performances fitting their parts and the overall script ... but certainly nothing here really stretched their talents. The female lead, Kristianna Loken, is new to me, but she's an attractive actress and turned in a solid performance.

The sound and cinematography seemed to have some problems of a technical nature. Some of the speech was obscured or sounded hollow; some of the camera slides were uneven.

Some of the scenes in the countryside were simply breathtaking. In fact, the whole flavor of horseback riding across these panoramic, wild, lush countrysides ... during daylight, during nighttime, during twilight ... all of this I liked very much indeed. Likewise I liked the castle(s), the monastery, the (fighting) monks, the boat that bore our heroes and heroines across the water ... these were all just delightfully lush, evocative ... the kind of scenes that just delight the heart of an old Medievalist like me. And the kinds of scenes that will thrill you as well if you like me are a Lord of the Rigns fan.

The general plot ... well ... is ""OK"" ... but this is the kind of movie that for myself I have a hard time caring about the Plot. The value of a Plot in some stories and movies to me is really just to provide a framework on which to depict wonderful moods and atmospherics and scenery and the delightful playing out of Myth of the Vampire. For this purpose the plot sufficed well.

There were several places during the action, though, in which the events were simply unconvincing. I won't give them away. And in a sort of high mythos or high legend movie like this, I'm certainly not in the least concerned with ""realism."" But everything that happens should surely be convincingly in accord with the movie's internal logic. Several parts failed this test though.

All in all, a good rich campy vampire flick. Not bad for an evening's entertainment. But you know ... I can't help but wonder if something with the scale and quality of the Lord of the Rings or the Chroniclkes of Narnia or even Harry Potter could be developed out of the rich, decaying, earthy mythos of the Vampire? If so that's a movie I'd love to see! Till then, though, hey: BloodRayne is a decent, fun vampire flick."
1435,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"This is not the best movie ever, but it was better than any recent Van Dam movies. The reason that a lot of people push and go out of their way to say that movies such as this suck are because they would rather the film have a large muscle bound man without a shirt as the star, than an attractive woman. I think that those people are very sexist.

It is true that this movie had a terrible script and dialogue. However, that isn't because of director Uwe Boll, or actress Kristanna Loken at all. Those factors point directly to the writer Guinevere Turner.

The customs were very accurate to the game. Except for Kristanna Loken's hair which wasn't red enough and appeared blonde in some scenes... but that would be because of the makeup artist not Kristanna. The fighting was magnificently sequenced and looked realistic. Now if you do want to point and say an actor did bad like everyone keeps doing, than you can point at Matthew Davis whom looked as though he were smiling even at the most odd moments.

If you like pointless action packed films, with a lot of blood, and you don't mind a female star, than this movie is right down your alleyway. But if you want storyline from this you might as well read a bunch of fortune cookies, because that is all that you'll get here. Heck I have crapped better scripts than Guinevere Turner, she slaughtered what was a great and enjoyable video game.

People don't listen to what these sexist bastards are saying. Use your own judgment without using other peoples judgment. And if you want an action film with storyline than you should see something like pulp fiction, not something taken from a freaking video game... common!"
1436,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Hostel was sold out tonight so my friends and I saw this. I can't believe I paid for it. This was the most atrocious movie I've ever seen.

I've never seen someone look as awkward with a sword as Rayne was. She honestly looked like she had no idea what she was doing with those gimmicky swords.

The dialogue was painful. I'd be interested to see the script because I'm wondering if there are any contractions at all. Nothing like over annunciated crap lines to make a bad movie really stand out.

I won't even try to explain the plot because there really wasn't one. Just think of vampire and fantasy movie clichés and you have Bloodrayne. I really felt like I was watching a movie written by a ten year old Dungeons and Dragons fan. There was no point to the movie at all and I didn't care what happened to anyone.

Billy Zane was great, Meatloaf was brilliant, but everyone else was just bad.

If you took Interview With a Vampire, the Dungeons and Dragons movie, and maybe the sequel to the Dungeons and Dragons movie, plus the Conan the Barbarian cartoon series and that vampire movie with Jim Carrey for good measure, and threw it all into a pot but made the main character a girl who can't fight but manages to defeat the world's most powerful vampire and you gave a lot of main characters raging mullets then, and only then would you have something like Bloodrayne.

This movie made me wish I was watching Underworld."
1437,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I actually watched this movie because i had to find out if the movie was as bad as many reviews claim. And i have to say i don't think it is.

Sure it's average to below average in most ways. Much of the dialogue is dull and uninspired. The script and screenplay mostly doesn't allow for the actors to unfold, to display their skills. The battle sequences are boring. And who the h... put that silly wig on Ben Kingsley, the guy is seriously a joke in this movie.

But there are also stuff that works - or works well enough for it to be a decent B-movie i should say. Kristanna Loken pulls it off the best she can with this script and manages to portray a slightly more vulnerable and down to earth type vampire hero. I think she also does well in her fight scenes. Michael Madsen although having nothing to work with looks good as a vampire hunter. Michelle Rodriguez is doing a good job as well.

The sound and score of the movie is also good and here and there actually manages to help build a little tension or suspense. Something that the movie often lacks.

I'll admit any day that it's a flawed movie. Still there have been many big Hollywood production movies that are less worth watching than this."
1438,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Most people don't consider it work to go and see a movie. Sadly, fate decided to make life difficult for me and my friends on the Friday of January 6th, 2006. All day I had been looking forward to the release of this glorious display of cinematic creativity, and I was sure to inform everybody I knew. You see, we had been there at the opening of ""Alone In The Dark,"" and afterward we were all hardcore fans. After watching ""House Of The Dead"" shortly afterward, we all wondered how that one had slipped passed us when it had been showing in theaters.

Unfortunately for me and my celebrating crew, disaster struck; the movie wasn't playing anywhere nearby. In fact, the closest location was Marysville, Washington, a city about 100 miles south of the one in which we all call our home. It was then that we knew what we had to do. We all drove into (our) town separately and parked our cars, meeting up at about 8:30 in the evening. That left us with an hour and fifteen minutes to cover the distance. Tragically, the man we chose to be driver (his driving skills far surpass our own) was unable to get off work. Thinking quickly, we bribed his manager and were on our way by 8:45.

Down the freeway we raced, stopping only briefly for gas. Praying that there were no police in the vicinity, we averaged about 100 miles per hour as we sped passed car and truck alike. ""I'm gonna be all kinds of angry if we die before we get to this movie,"" I shouted over the horrible clanking of his rapidly disintegrating engine, ""And what in God's name is that noise."" The car was shaking violently, but we all knew the risks.

At long last we pulled into to parking lot and raced inside. After buying tickets and popcorn, we made it into the theater just in time to see the preview for his next film: ""In The Name Of The King."" It was then that we knew that this tradition of ours would resume in the coming winter. That was a thought for a later time, however. We sat down and spent the next hour and a half enjoying the underrated brilliance of a particular German director."

1446,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"This is not a major piece of fantasy film-making, but neither is it anywhere near as bad as many would appear to think. It's considerably better than, say, 'Dungeons and Dragons,' and in some ways comparable even to John Boorman's wildly uneven 'Excalibur'. It's reasonably entertaining, which is all it really sets out to be, and thus it's rather more mediocre than truly atrocious.

The highlight of the film is undoubtedly the score, primarily by Henning Lohner. It's omnipresent (which is not always a bad thing in these sorts of films), but it manages to work up considerable excitement and even a fair measure of grandeur (aided in part by an odd motivic echo of the opening of Cliff Eidelman's score for 'Star Trek VI' ). The closing sequence of the film is much more impressive than might have been expected, in large part due to the music. In fact, proportional to the overall quality of the respective films, this score is considerably better than that for 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'.

The production values, while far short of the Narnia and Lord of the Rings films, are not so cheap as to detract from the fun. Some of the sets (Kagan's central hall, for example), have real presence, and the FX are always at least passable and sometimes striking. The cinematography , while generally derivative in style and appearance, is at its best in the slower sequences; the action sequences tend to be choppy and even unintentionally blurry. In fact, had this film been a little less determined to whip up action so often, it would have been the better for it. There's a nice sequence where Rayne walks through a town market and sees the vampires beneath the human faces which suggests how much the film would have benefited from a less frenetic pace, for example.

The weakest element is the acting. Kristanna Loken, in the title role, is adequate and sometimes expressive (her final on-screen moments do not draw all of their power from the music); given more room to develop, her character portrayal might well have been more emotionally moving. Geraldine Chaplin manages to make the small role of the Fortuneteller relaxed and believable. Ben Kingsley has physical presence but little more as the villain; Michael Madsen is wretched as the leader of the anti-vampire group, as is Meat Loaf as an rather louche vampire. The rest of the players are generally competent but unexciting.

The screenplay, by Guinevere Turner, is not as confusing as some have claimed (or at least it didn't especially confuse me). There's not much in the way of character development, but as that is rarely the case in sword-and-sorcery films it seems unfair to belabor the point here. The motivations of the major characters are reasonably clear, if one-dimensional, and there is at least some attempt to give Rayne more depth than her type is usually allowed, which pays off in the ambiguous final shot.

I suspect that many people have watched this film expecting it to be wretched, given the reputation of director Uwe Boll. Having never seen any other Boll films, I am in no position to comment on his work as a whole, but it strikes me that the reaction to this one, at least, is rather unfair. Although it's not very good, neither is it awful; while there are many better films even within its genre, there are surely many more that are far far worse.

--This review was written regarding the theatrical release. Some years later I happened to see the DVD version, which is, oddly enough, noticeably worse. Apparently the production company tamped down Uwe Boll's desire for gore for the U.S. release, a desire he was able to exercise fully in the DVD version. The result is a much choppier (so to speak) and less effective film. I begin to understand why so many people think Boll is such a bad director....--"

1455,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Bottom 100? Seriously, people. It's not THAT bad.

A cinematic masterpiece it ain't, I give you that much. Certainly, it's not very historically accurate. (Who cares?) And the acting and the fighting scenes could do with some improvement. People who can't stand anything but top notch acting might want to consider other options I guess.

However, as a not-very-realistic type action movie, it's not bad. It's no deep and thought-provoking movie, but it does its job as decent action entertainment for one evening. In my humble opinion, it's clearly on par with movies in the same segment, such as ""Van Helsing"" and ""Tomb Raider"". And it's about a thousand times better than, say, ""Doom"".

I would have expected an IMDb rating of about 5 for this one, and objectively I think that would probably be an appropriate one. I'm a sucker for vampire movies though and I'm no movie critic, so I give it a 7. Personally, I liked it."
1456,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I'm a fan of the Bloodrayne video game series and this is the only reason I went to watch the movie, that and Kristanna Loken of course. ;) I feel sad giving this movie a 1 because in reality it deserves a COMPLETE ZERO!! I already knew this movie was going to be bad because Uwe Boll, the Director has completely annihilated all the horror-based videogames to movie conversions out there, House of the Dead & Alone in the Dark are proof of this testament.

The thing that shocked me was that this movie was actually worse than both of those movies combined!!! The movie follows the game's plot but he executes it very poorly. Kristanna Loken who plays the role of Bloodrayne is suppose to have a ""Blade"" like personality but instead she's just another Terminator.

On top of that, the action scenes look like they were choreographed by a blind man with brain damage (I'll leave that to your imagination). Bloodrayne is supposed to have a very Gothic atmosphere but instead Uwe Boll decides to set the atmosphere at a trick-or-treat level.

By the time I was done watching this movie, I realized that my eyes bled. Do yourself a favor and save yourself from torture by avoiding this movie at all costs."
1457,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I watched this movie over the weekend. I remember when it was released, and was finally able to watch it. Sadly, I even read a review posted here that said it was awful, but thought to myself, ""Surely this person just doesn't like these types of movies."" Wrong!! Anybody that enjoys movies would hate this. This is what they should play to the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay to break them. The lines were so stilted and monotone that at times I wondered if the actors were even in to it, or if they just wanted to get it over with. How far has Ben Kingsley fallen? Did he forget that he won an Oscar? And Michelle Rodriguez, has she been in a movie (or television show) where she didn't play the sulky, pouty, scowly part? What about the Sebastian guy-he reminded of a mulletted Stiffler-kind of like the role Seann William Scott had in Old School. Speaking of Sebastian, how tough can vampire killers be when they're named Vladimir and Sebastian. Aren't those Muppet characters? I won't bother to get into much more. Read other reviews for support of my ranting. One thing that I thought was really bad was the blood in the fight scenes. Whoever did the special effects must think that all people have tons of blood right at the surface of their skin and it's really pressurized. The spraying blood was so ridiculous that I couldn't even laugh at it, I was just mad that somebody was paid money to do that.

So, please, if you haven't seen the movie, don't disregard this review, or the million others that say that this movie should be put out of its misery."
1458,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Just another in Uwe Boll's endless cookie cutter zombie/video game series. It's the same old stuff: sexy babes in leather biker-chic type war uniforms (cheap Xena wannabe's), swords, blood, gore, phony Medieval accents, impossibly large castles, lousy CGI, and more.

The story is this: there is no story. You have a half-breed vampire (what??) named ""Rayne"" who wants to get even with the creepy Kagen (Ben Kingsley slumming it) because he croaks lots of people (and he wants to croak her too)--or something like that. She reluctantly joins a bunch of barbarians, with the ever-tough-girl Michelle Rodriguez trying to look--what else-tough. More blood. More gore. More phony accents. More non-story action. More insane CGI.

Uwe Boll tried to top his epic ""House of the Dead,"" and comes mighty close. If you like endless, mindless, purposeless sword fight scenes with occasional stoic dialog interludes, see this movie. If you're a fan of so-bad-it's-funny trash movies, maybe you'll find humor in it. All others: be forewarned."
1459,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"People love to hate this movie, but it's not as bad as those people say.

Is it bad? Yes, of course. It's like the worst, and most gory, soft-porn version of ""Buffy"" that you've ever seen. But it doesn't deserve over 50% ""1"" votes. Giving a movie a ""1"" means that there is no movie worse than it, and that is simply not true.

The Sci Fi channel recently showed BloodRayne and it was better than 95% of the Sci Fi channel's original movies. ""Mansquito,"" anyone?

People hate Uwe Boll. Violently. Thus, most of the ""1"" ratings are the results of rabid gamers who have a vendetta against him. This is unfortunate as it skews the results.

To me, the worst thing about this movie was Michael Madsen. He didn't seem to be acting at all, just reading words. He is followed closely by Ben Kingsley, Meatloaf and their bad hairpieces. I wish there was more of Udo Kier, I loved him as Yuri in the Command and Conquer game series. The sets and props were also pretty good, as was the music. Too many of the swords were obviously cut sheet metal, though, and the fight scenes were only slightly better than something you might see on Xena.

While I won't defend this movie, I don't think it deserves the infamy that it has."
1460,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Uwe Boll has outdone himself -- not an easy thing to do -- with BLOODRAYNE, the story of a quasi-vampire on the trail of a fiend who raped and killed her mama. The gal from T3, Kristanna Lokken, plays Bloodrayne, and reminds us again that she has absolutely no acting talent. She is, however easy on the eye. Nevertheless, she is no match for the babes from the UNDERWORLD and RESIDENT EVIL series. Hell, she isn't even up to the likes of Charlize Theron as Aeon Flux, a role equally worthy of a Razzie if ever there was one. You know how bad a movie truly is when someone like David Warner or Jeremy Irons or Ben Kingsley turns up as the movie's cardboard villain. Kingsley wins the honors here. He is ludicrous, and seems to know it. He mostly stands around and emits great pauses between snatches of horribly inane dialog. Kingsley has taken on several very bad roles over the years, and I think this one tops all others. Plus Michael Madsen as a vampire hunter mumbles and stumbles his way through yet another Z-grade production. So what's left? The battle scenes are clumsily staged. The gore is pretty standard. There is one hot scene featuring a badly-bewigged Meat Loaf surrounded by a bevy of naked women, who just so happen to be real-life streetwalkers. Too bad the focus is on the Loaf."

I enjoy a good horror flick too but it really needs purpose and above all it should at least make sense with the movie. Good Grief! This was just plain awful.

OK here is a spoiler if you played the games and are expecting anything along the same lines your not going to find it in this piece of crap of a film.

Both the film and the game contain a female character named Rayne and this character is part human and part Vampire that is where the similarities stop. In the Game Bloodrayne takes place during WWII and allows players to kill Nazis and zombies the movie went in a completely different path and takes place in the middle ages. The story for this movie is terrible, Directing is substandard, acting is bad, and the characters are written poorly. the only almost redeeming thing in this entire movie is that you get a shot of Kristanna Loken's tits. they are nice but really not worth the time it takes to fast forward to that part of the film little lone watch the stupid thing.

See the problem is I love a bad movie, when it is deserving of the title. They give me something to bitch and yell about. This so called awful movie had some nice gore and want not but it wasn't anything I am going to cry to the world about.

Bloodrayne also isn't a great game to boot, but it was made and I was pleased with what I watched. Will I go out and by it on DVD? Certainly not. Will I watch it on TBS at 2 am, probably? That also goes for ""alone in the dark"" has been series which was pretty much dead and crushed due to resident evil comes out with a movie that easy to watch. So complain that Tara Reid was in it and destroyed your life. (She had a few lines and was never in the way to bother)

BloodRayne is a video game adaptation. Alarm bells should have been ringing in my head but I decided to approach it with an open mind, I shrugged away the 2.2 rating on IMDb.com and pretended I didn't see the ""Bottom 100"" listing.

Yeah I know, big mistake. Don't need to tell me twice.

There is not one iota of originality within BloodRayne and it follows the tried and tested (sometimes successful) formula of ""Half human, half vampire hero/heroine-in-really-bad-costume must stop evil head vampire from slaughtering the world"", or something like that. Blade, Underworld..been there, done that, got the t-shirt, thanks. Which genius decided we needed another take? And this isn't even a half- baked attempt, this is just an exercise in really, really bad film-making.

The acting is absolutely horrible and all I can suppose is that the likes of Rodriguez, Madsen and Kingsley must have been desperate for a paycheck. Loken, after her turn in Terminator 3, well she just wanted her big break. All the poor girl got was a big belly flop of a role in a stinker of a movie.

With a plot as fresh as week-old roadkill, laughable, stilted dialog and action scenes with as much style and grace as a monkey in a tutu, BloodRayne is a complete and utter waste of time. Easily the worst movie so far for 2006."

However, I did like the actress they got to do Rayne, but the director, oh my Lord, he has butchered every video game movie he has done (by the way his name is Uwe Boll), and sadly he also got his hands on another video game movie that is still in production (it's called Far Cry, when it come out, heed my warning and stay the hell away from it).

I was in the process of ripping on From Just To Kelly, which was aptly placed at #3 worst movie of all time, but then I scrolled down to see Bloodrayne. When saying FJTK was the worst movie since Garbage Pail Kids and Howard The Duck, I was clearly mistaken. Bloodrayne along with After Dark get my vote. After Dark I could only sit through 10 minutes of before I had to turn it off and immediately return it to Blockbuster. Better to lose some money than time off of my life. Bloorayne I could only sit through 20 minutes of disbelief.

The only reason I even watched it is because Guinevere Turner wrote it, my friend's cousin stars in it and vampire movies are one of my faves. But after seeing this hunk of trash I seriously have to question Miss Turner's actual talents. Every element of this film was bad and not the least bit entertaining. I normally consider Michelle Rodriguez a decent actor but all performances were bad in this film. I can only imagine because they were wondering what would happen to their careers after this film hit the theatres.

And the fact that there's been million of vampire tales told and this film STILL couldn't tell vampire lore correctly is just pathetic.

This gets my true vote for worst film ever. Howard the Duck at least had Leah Thompson and a duck that smokes cigars. That's worth at least a chuckle."

But who else then Kristina Loken would agree to play in movie directed by Uwe Bol? Madsen. I don't know why. It seems like some kind of mistake, because his place surely isn't in this movie. The acting is out of the question. The scenario is like written by four years old boy and then thrown to the garbage, where Uwe and his team found it. The dialogs are strange. Some serious guys are may be talking about the end of the human race. We are scared. This could be the horror element in the movie. When they finish talking they fight a bit and that's supposed to be the action element. We have successfully completed the genre requirements.

The whole thing is more like comedy than horror or action. There was nothing unique or interesting in this movie. The director even hired prostitutes for some of the scenes.

I had the misfortune of watching Boll's previous ""effort"", Alone in the Dark, and I knew nothing good could come out of this crazed German and a vampire/slayer video game franchise.

First of all, the story is quite different from the game's, changing Rayne's birth from XXth century to XVIth century (or was it XVIIth?). Rayne's character wasn't fine at all: the hair color wasn't right, the eye color wasn't right, the Rayne-trademark-outfit just didn't look good (and that was a VERY important factor), and overall... it all wasn't right. I really liked Loken's role on Terminator 3, but what I saw in this movie was QUITE far away from that, just like everyone's poor quality acting.

The story is weak, characters are not memorable at all, Bloodrayne's vampires look even faker than Buffy's, the camera moves a LOT during the fighting scenes, the sex scene would rather fit on a porn movie (it came out of nowhere), dialogues are cheesy, and most of the movie is just TOO dark.

2 - I am a big film fan, and like the vampire / horror genre.

The film is purely awful from start to finish. The only good thing I can possibly think of is that the cast is definitely impressive for a film of this caliber. Michael Madsen, a legend of cult cinema, sways his way through the film swinging a sword like he's drunk. Ben Kingsly mumbles about as if he's simply bored. Kristanna Loken looks beautiful but doesn;t carry the furiosity of Rayne....and therefore simply doesn't create a sense of believability. Michelle Roudriguez looks as if she'd rather be doing some porn film and Meat Loaf just seems to be on aboard for the opportunity to lounge around in a room full of prostitutes.

The sword fighting / battle scenes on show are beyond disgrace. There was obviously no choreography involved and the actors / actresses clearly didn't have the time to be put into training sessions. The sets and wardrobe all feel like castouts from Harry Potter or Lord Of The Rings.

There is a sex scene involving the beautiful Kristanna Loken and some Matt guy....instead of increasing a romantic sub plot, tension or signs of ""human emotion"" within Rayne...the scene simply feels like a seqence from a porn film has been lifted into the film.

1497,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"How to make a good story to a perfectly crap. They used good rendered effects, but not in the correct situations. When you see ""Bloodrayne"" fighting you should think that your mother do it better. Awful. Anyway when i've started to watch the movie i thought that it will be good. (I played the game and it was fun and pretty good) After i finished it i was in the affect of misunderstanding around the end action. (She goes and sit to the throne -O_o- )

So if you don't want to see a really bad movie, please don't watch it. I like movies witches based on vampire stories, but this is not what i like. Anyway i think that a vampire has to be elegant, (and not just the clothes makes a vampire elegant, his/her move culture, smile, speech, turn up, and other qualities has to be elegant and special as well) in this movie vampires weren't so elegant, they weren't like vampire at all. No special skills (i mean some antigravity or something what can makes a vampire to be itself), all those were just actors with some funny acting skills who wanted to be a vampire in the screen, but as we see it didn't work."
1498,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"There are many things that have already been said about this movie and Uwe Boll so i will try to focus on the positive aspects (although they are few and far between).

This is the best of a bad bunch of films by a terrible director hence the 2 stars i gave it (the rest of his movies deserve 1 or below). The movie is a confused mess and even the top names that appear in the film can't save it from the awful dialouge and directing. It remains a mystery to me how Uwe can get the talented actors to appear in his movies and how he manages every time to pull the worst performance of there career.

The exception in bloodrayne is Michelle Rodriguez who manages to be convincing even with the lack of direction and awful script i only hope the movie does not damage the careers of any of the other amazing actors who appear in this crapfest.

Despite being burnt time and time again i'm sure i will watch dungeon siege (i'm also pretty sure i'll hate it and kick myself again) and will continue to hold on to the slight hope that one day Uwe will actually make a good job of one of his movies because the video game fan in me still gets excited by the concept of game to movie franchise's.

If you are like me regardless of what I or anyone else says you will watch this movie just remember when your trying to throw yourself off a bridge for putting yourself through another Uwe Boll flick that one day he will be dead it is that thought alone allows me to continue to watch his crap.

I tried to focus on the positive aspects of this movie but after proof reading what i wrote i can see i failed, oh well i did try."

As if House of the Dead wasn't bad enough, and as if Alone in the Dark wasn't even worse, this man has been allowed to get his hands on even more game franchises. I'm not entirely sure who, on a game production staff, is in charge of choosing the director who will turn said game into a movie, but whoever it is, they obviously never go outside, or they would be painfully aware of how absolutely horrible what they are doing to their own game is.

1500,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I've seen some bad movies in my day, few of which I've seen at the big screen. The biggest one I can recall was Ishtar, but this steaming pile of excrement from Uwe Boll takes the proverbial cake.

This thing should never have been released to the theaters, but gone straight to SciFi's Saturday Night lineup, or maybe USA's Up All Night. I felt that I was trapped in Mystery Science Theater 3000 watching a horrible movie. Luckily for me (unlucky for her) I had my wife with me. After about half and hour we gave up on groaning under our breath about how terrible that scene was, or that effect, or the dialog, and we just flat out started heckling the movie. I suppose we offended the other movie patrons, but it was hard to tell, as the other couple there was making out and never seemed to come up for air, while the one other guy there was on his cell phone the entire time (likely calling all his friends warning them about the movie).

I actually enjoy a number of campy B Movies, I'm a fan of most of the Troma Films myself, but to take a good video game with a strong story and utterly destroy it with terrible directing, dialog that seemed written for and performed by grade school children (my 4 year old's preschool talent show was more entertaining) and craptacular editing should be criminal.

I can only hope that Uwe Boll loses enough money on this venture to prevent him from ruining other video game based movies."
1501,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"There are some movies that are so bad that they are actually fun to watch (any Ed Wood film for example). Unfortunately, ""Bloodrayne"" is not THAT bad; it merely plunges to the depths of ""awful"". I rated this a ""1"" because there is no ""0"" on the IMDb scale.

I am reminded of the phrase ""totally without redeeming social importance"" once used to define certain artistic efforts as pornographic. While that description accurately describes this film, it cannot even stake a claim to be smut when its single sex scene fails to be even mildly interesting, never mind erotic.

For those of you who have seen this film, my sympathies; for those who have not, wait for the DVD, it should be available in about 15 minu"
1502,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"My friends don't even bother wasting your money. The was probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It wasn't bad because of the location or the way it was shot. It was just some of the most god awful acting I have ever seen in my life. I could have maybe enjoyed this film had the dialogue been better, and the actors not sound like they were just reading straight from the script. Even Billy Zane sucked, its sad an actor I used to admire has fallen so far down the ladder...I mean did he need the rent money or what? It was mainly the actors and the dialogue that made this such a bad movie. My friend and I could not decide who was a worst actor Madsen or Rodriguez? Personally I feel it was a tie.

Madsen looked like he was drunk the entire film and Rodriguez was trying way to hard to pull of an accent of some kind. It was almost as bad as watching Keanu Reeves try to do an English accent. Honestly at one point Madsen and Rodriguez switched accents, and then they switched back again. It went from English to Romanian to Street and back to English again. Even Ben Kingsley the great Ben Kingsley sucked as well. As for the main actress Kristanna Loken, if not for my huge crush on her I would not of seen this movie to begin with. But believe me when I say you are not missing much and Uwe Boll should not get to make movies anymore."

Acting sucks, CGI sucks, makeup sucks, the sex scene sucks the most of it all, god, what a random sex shot.

I guess for Uwe Boll it's not a great deal to actually lose a great part of his money producing films like these, and neither is for studios. I hope he doesn't get Metal Gear Solid.

1505,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I was seriously surprised by this film. First off, I'm a fan of the vampire genre but have generally disliked most vampire films. So I usually go to see them but am usually disappointed. Given the fact that I severely disliked House of Dead, I was really expecting a big yawnfest. Plus the trailers did nothing to help me want to see the film. If anything, the trailers are absolutely horrible. I haven't seen Alone in the Dark, and don't really plan to, but with House of Dead and the bad trailers I was really bracing for a nightmare.

But then as soon as the movie started, I was surprised. The visuals were very lush, the movie just looked very good (as opposed to that sickly green tint in the trailer). As far as the story, yeah, it's a bit convoluted, and doesn't exactly give you that sort of real pull, but Kristanna Loken really tries to push it and it's just enough that it doesn't seem so bad. It's unfortunate that the script isn't better, as Guinevere Turner is very talented, and did a great job adapting American Psycho into a screenplay.

As far as the acting, well, Billy Zane's acting wasn't so bad. He was dictating a letter, and therefore the William Shatner-ish acting made sense. Ben Kingsley had a very quiet reserve of someone in power. Michael Madsen's acting was sort of half-there, but his character was sort of half-there, he seemed like someone who didn't care to fight anymore and just kept fighting out of a sense of duty.

So yeah, nobody's going to get an Oscar out of this, but we all know that. Yeah, there's been better acting in better movies, but we all know this as well. But if you lower your expectations, drop your barrier of ""entertain me"" and just surrender to the movie, you'll find yourself sitting afterward going ""hey, that wasn't so bad. That was actually good."" Notice, I said GOOD, not GREAT. Both me and my girlfriend give it a C+ to B- range. Is it going to be a hit with critics? No. Is it going to be a hit with Uwe Boll haters? No. But is it better than Dracula 2000, Dracula 3000, and Queen of the Damned? Yes. Is Uwe Boll getting better since House of Dead? Yes, very much so."
1506,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I know nothing of the video game and had only slightly paid attention to critiques of Uwe Boll. I was expecting cheese like House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark - both movies I enjoyed simply for the action and special effects. BloodRayne was so far below cheese, I couldn't stand it. The plot was one dimensional allowing no character development. The dialogue was elementary. The action was hack/slash just so they could spray fake blood, even the sword fights were horrible- they didn't even try. The ending made no sense. From a pure movie making point of view, there weren't even any really good cinematic shots; the clothing looked like it was purchased from a replica catalog's mistakes; and the sets were uninspired. With the cast this boasted, I was expecting much more than it delivered. Will I see other Uwe Boll movies? Yes, but I will wait for the DVD rent"

1509,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I don't think ""Americans"" are being over critical. I think they're upset that Uwe Boll keeps making god awful movies based on the ideas of video games showing he has absolutely no skill as a director. And what's worse is he keeps doing it despite the overwhelmingly negative reviews telling to please stop! Yea I'm an American and I think Hollywood movies are garbage. And Uwe Boll fits in perfectly with the all the other Hollywood garbage.

Uwe Boll has been so consistently bad I don't understand why he keeps making video game movies. Can't he make something original for a change? Make something that isn't video game related for awhile?

Granted I have a ""If it's based on a video game it's going to be crap"" mentality but that's probably because of directors like Uwe Boll who should be playing games instead of making movies based on them."
1510,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Another vampire movie has just come out. ""Bloodrayne"" is as bloody as its namesake. Here you have a woman named Rayne(Kristanna Loken) as a sultry but lethal dhampir who kills anyone who crosses her. Even a vampire is the victim of her wrath. She is trusting among some people, but many dread the undead. Don't we all? Unless they fight back, the humans have Rayne on her side. Vladamir(Michael Madsen,""Species1&2""), Sebastian(Matt Davis), and Katarin(Michelle Rodriguez) lead the way to find Kagan(Ben Kingsley). To me part of this game based movie is quite similar to ""Castlevania"", however, Dracula is never mention, so that's good. It's amazing that Rayne was sympathetic to the sister whose brother was slain by the vampires. And I liked the part where Rayne seduced the woman vampire and killed her afterward, and the thieves rob her later. Just like the game, Rayne has a hot body, and Sebastian took advantage of ""being inside her"". Reminds me of ""Innocent Blood"". It's a shame that Katarin turned out to be a turncoat, and everything is way out of whack. How would the fighters know? The effects and the fight scenes were indeed awesome, and the blood was just too much. It's great that Loken got to do more and show very much in this movie. I know Rayne was heartbroken when Sebastian decided to die than to live forever, for him why live when your family is avenged. It's a pity that he would be dead than live with the soul mate who is indeed ""shared her heart"". I'd been a fool to sacrifice when there's more terror out there. A very interesting movie, lots of action, lots of fun, and it's great for all the fans of the game. I enjoyed it a lot! It was interesting and intriguing. Rating 2.5 out of 5 stars."
1511,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Before you decide to watch ""BloodRayne"", there are a few things you might want to consider. First, it's a based on a videogame and these sorts of things are notoriously awful. Think about it...what GOOD videogame movies can you think of off the top of your head?! But bad ones....""Super Mario Brothers"" and ""Mortal Kombat: Annihilation"" probably come to mind. So, it's not surprising that ""BloodRayne"" is now #27 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list. And, if neither of these convince you it's crap...it was directed by Uwe Boll. Boll has made a career out of making crappy films about videogames, with such classics as ""Far Cry"", ""Alone in the Dark"" and ""House of the Dead"" to his credits. Surely, the man can take the barest of plots and convert them into long, bloated films!

The film begins with a vampire woman being held like an animal at some sort of freak show where she is tormented. Eventually, however, she escapes and, inexplicably, joins up with a group of vampire slayers(???) to kill the man who apparently raped and killed her mother long ago. Vampires teaming up with vampire slayers?! That's like expecting Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi to team up for a buddy picture!! They explain that BloodRayne is different...she is a vampire who lives to kill vampires! That's because she's a half-vampire! If this sort of thing makes no sense, don't blame this film...vampire lore is constantly changing these days. Try reading a few recent vampire novels and you'll see what I mean....as now, many can go out in daylight, some are born vampires, some sparkle, BloodRayne can wear a crucifix and much more.

So is this any good? Well, it looks nice...and this isn't surprising because Boll loves to spend money to make big and nice looking films. Also, it has a few respectable actors in it...another Boll touch. Michael Madsen, Ben Kingsley and Geraldine Chaplin both prove that with enough money, an actor with a good reputation is willing to undermine it a bit. As for Meatloaf....well...Mr. Loaf is in the film as well.

So why all the hate...as well as the abysmal current score of 2.9? Well, much of it is because there is so much fighting...it is numbing. Another issue is the dialog, which at times is pretty limp. I think it's also a bit dull and not fun to watch. But, I would argue that there at least are worse videogame-based films. It's not as bad as ""Mortal Kombat: Annihilation"" nor ""Super Mario Brothers""....hardly a glowing endorsement, but it wasn't quite as bad as I'd anticipated. I think much of it's low score is because the film lost so much money AND because Boll's name is pretty much synonymous with the word 'sucks'."
1512,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"So, I'll start by saying I hate Uwe Boll... He doesn't know the meaning of ""respect"" when regarding movie-lovers... He does this only thinking on profit, and really doesn't give a rat's behind if the movie is good or bad...

Still, I think this one is quite entertaining... There's blood, guts and action... I never enjoyed the game, itself, so it's easy for me to see this one without comparing it to the videogame. I prefer to watch this one a thousand times, than only one Twilight... this is a vampire movie for adults, and not any crappy teen romantic flick. It's not outstanding, but it does the trick: entertain"

1514,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Deep in the heart of Romania, vampire slayers hear a story about a woman believed to be a monster in a low-rent carnival nearby, and once she escapes she learns of her fate to acquire a special amulet to battle a vampire master and agrees to help them overcome the army of vampires.

There's actually a lot more than what would seem to indicate. Among its best features is the old-time setting as it's such a welcome change from what is normally given to us about vampires. It also plays a part of it being a nice sweeping epic-look to it with the sweeping vistas and swelling orchestral scores and is a really pleasant change to see a film go for a feel like that with a very epic feeling present throughout here. In addition, the inclusion of her vampire tendencies in that type of storyline allows for some enjoyable action present here, starting with the beginning where a carnival man drags her out and spills water on her arm, resulting in severe burns before the blood of a farm animal causes her wounds to instantly heal back to normal, the carnival massacre is a nice set-piece that enables her escape into the world as well as the manipulation of several traps held in the church for their protection. It's best sequence is where one character is trapped inside a quickly flooding cavern which is nicely suspenseful, as is a daytime raid on a brothel to rescue a kidnapped ally. There are also several well-choreographed extended battles here that wouldn't seem out of place in a medieval movie to provide lots of action, from the assault on the monastery to capture her to the various battles that take place inside the temple at the end which manages to contain plenty of action, confrontations and graphic bloodshed which is really nice and bloody. This is far better than what is said about it as there is very little in here that didn't work. The main thing that hurts this is the side-plots that are thrown in every now and then to try to add more to the story but actually take away from it. The main gist here is good enough and serves the film well since there's only a single thread that covers the action. When a new idea is brought up, such as the inclusion of the need for the various amulets to be obtained before anything can transpire or the vampire rituals that are needed to be performed before they can continue their plans, it only confuses rather than explain due to the excessive elements brought in that don't add much. As well, the change in nature from the video-game to the movie is a little different which might be a problem for some to get over. These here are what manage to hold this one down.

Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Language, Nudity and a mild sex scene."

1516,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"There is Hollywood and there are the independents. The storyline is always the same, some vampire has to be killed. In Underworld it's the same, but that one contained a lot of CGI and had a lot of money. But the fact that CGI doesn't work makes it sometimes boring although it is a good movie. Bloodrayne also has some real 'declined' good actors. The storyline is as always the same but what makes this movie hateful or adorable is the amount of gore in it. And as I watched closely I noticed that Olaf Ittenbach was involved. The master of gore himself. Some killings or slaughterings are not for the squeamish and that's the main reason that people are hating this flick. But if you love vampires and gore than your in for a good flick, I just can't believe that it has a 2,4 on the scale. That was also one of the reasons that I never watched it earlier but it was one of those days that you feel you have to give it a try. I was not disappointed. It has an open end, and there is now Bloodrayne 2 available. Let's hope the gore stays intact. It's a one of his kind to see really good and well known (Ben Kingsley, Udo Kier) actors in this nice flick. So be"
1517,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Curious about the man often referred to as the modern day Edward Wood Jr., my friends and I decided to watch our first Uwe Boll movie. Unfortunately, the only one I could get for a dollar was BloodRayne II, and one of my friends objected to watching a sequel without having seen the original, so he went to Blockbuster to rent the first one. Three hours of incompetence is far too much, as you must imagine. The first one doesn't, in fact, rank as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's poor, to be sure, but there was enough cleavage and gory violence to keep at least the juvenile part of my mind (a huge part of my total mind, to be perfectly honest!) engaged. BloodRayne is a Medieval action movie about a half vampire gal (Kristen Loken, from Terminator 3) looking to kill her father (Ben Kingsley), the vampire ruler who raped and killed her mother. She joins up with a secret society whose purpose it is to exterminate vampires (led by Michael Madsen, Matt Davis and Michelle Rodriguez). Also in this far too accomplished cast are Billy Zane, Udo Kier, Geraldine Chaplin and Meat Loaf (credited as ""Meatloaf Aday""). As with most of Uwe Boll's movies, this one is based on a video game. But apparently he or the studio or the screenwriter or whoever decided that the game's fans, the only ones who would probably be interested in seeing the movie anyway, weren't worth pleasing, because the games take place in like the 1940s or something (the little bit I saw of it had cars, anyway), and this one takes place in Medieval times, I guess because the time period is hot or something because of the Lord of the Rings movies. The whole movie seems lazy. The look on every actor's face is that one that says, ""Give me my paycheck!"" Sometimes they attempt a British-sounding accent, but that comes and goes. It doesn't look at all like the film had an action choreographer. The violence during the action sequences is delightfully nasty. If you can giggle at poorly done decapitations and dismemberment, those parts of the movie are moderately fun. But much of the film just has the characters standing around talking, and it gets really boring."
1518,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,Warning: Spoi
1519,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Bloodrayne, spun-off the popular video game, is one of those movies that you think will suck. Well, lo and behold, its doesn't. Thats due to Uwe Boll's hyper-kinetic direction and Kristanna Loken's full on performance. They drive the story at such Pace that you barely have time to sit back and say, ""Gee, that was silly""

There is some silliness here. Rayne, the off-spring of a very malignant vampire lord played by, of all people, Ben Kingsley, and a human mother, is reduced to an abused carnival freak. She breaks free, slaughtering people left and right, only to hook up with the Brimstone three, warriors who battle the undead. She learns her father, Kagan, is trying to find three talismans to unlock secrets that will enable vampires free reign and thus take over the earth. Since he raped and killed her mother, Rayne is happy to saddle up for revenge.

Did I mention the action? Terrific battle scenes and more exotic weaponry that you could shake your scimitar at. Loken's acting may not match her physical abilities, but who cares? She's smoking hot here. Michael Madsen, slumming again, is the be-wigged anti-hero Vladimir and he actually does more than the occasional growl. Matt DAvis is the requisite young hunk. He's dull but his scenes with Loken are passionate. Michelle Rodriguez is along as the hard to figure KAtarin, she's very good here, all accent and sullen looks and sex appeal. Rodriguez was one of the best things about the original ""Resident Evil"" and she proves again that she's a talented actress. Billy Zane plays her father, and please more of this terrific actor! He steals both his scenes so easily its like he's in a better movie.

Thats not to denigrate Bloodrayne, with is quick, exciting and very bloody, seriously, were talking Bram Stoker here. Rayne ends up absorbing the talismans that Kagan wants, thats weird and never explained very well. How does she do this? Why? The climax of the picture in Kagan's predictably dark castle, is a bit arch and the last shot of Rayne taking her Father's throne is way too enigmatic for me. What does this mean? Is she OK? Or will she be like him? Odd ending. Still I really enjoyed this flick. If your'e not too demanding and enjoy medieval romps with lots of sex and violence, this is a good crowd pleaser. Oh, yes that is Meat Loaf!!!"
1520,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Overall an average movie, but the really sexy main actress makes it a bit above average. Worths being seen.

The story is decent, though rather sketchy. Rayne looks rather vulnerable and weak, not the all powerful chick we see in the video game. But that might be a good thing. The fighting scenes are not very good, but that's the way they are in almost all movies. The bad characters are generally mildly evil, not diabolically evil. The good characters have their weaknesses and tend to die in the fights. Those are rather good points too.

I heard in one of the scenes the half-naked women around Leonid (Meat Loaf), were real prostitutes as they were cheaper to hire than real actresses. Well, I think they were more suited for that role than actresses, I couldn't tell the difference.

I watched it on TV and I felt quite entertained. I didn't feel like changing the channel at any point, so I don't understand those 90% of the comments which rate this movie as awful. I agree most Uwe Boll films are bad, but this one looked OK to me.

Edit: I've also just seen the uncensored version so I changed my vote from 8 to 9 for extra blood and gore."
1521,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"A lot can be said about Uwe Boll, and I'm sure much of it is true. He's been called one of our times worst directors - A present day Edward D. Wood, Jr.. But why always look at him with a negative sight? Well yes, he's made some truly C-R-A-P, ex. 'Alone in the Dark', but nevertheless, I really enjoyed his 'BloodRayne', and it kept me entertained all the way through. The film was filled with action and a straight story, okay acting and wonderful bloody B-movie action.

My only catch with the film, is the lack of character development. You don't get much time to get to know the individual characters, which is a shame because the story is a wonderful and DARK adventure. Kristanna Loken is a great actress, and she looks marvelous and sexy as the vengeful Rayne.

I've seen a lot of films in my life, and believe me when I say that there is much more worse films on the market than 'BloodRayne', ex. 'Aeon Flux', 'Van Helsing' and 'Catwoman'. What makes 'BloodRayne' so good is among others the dark atmosphere, some well placed horror, not too much CGI, NO irritating one liners and great bloody B-movie effects. Maybe Uwe Boll's film-making is not the best, but believe when I say that 'BloodRayne' has got much more beating that it has deserved."

But, I think if it had a decent director and a better writer it would have done so much better. Yes, the plot deviates greatly from the game, but so did Resident Evil's, and that movie wasn't so bad. I felt that Boll did a horrendous job explaining several points of the plot, such as why Kagan needs the parts of Belial. The special effects were nothing special, and in places they were downright campy (especially the incredibly fake death of the guardian of the eye).

While watching this movie, I shed a silent tear for Michelle Rodriguez, Bill Kingsley, Billy Zane, and some of the other actors who, if given a decent script, could have made this movie good, maybe even great. Who knows? It's not their fault.

I saw it on SciFi, edited of course. Now I want to watch the DVD version, and probably check out the sequel, too!"
1529,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"mysticwit (mysticwit@yahoo.com) from Austin, TX: My opinion of your comment is that you didn't pay money to see the movie because you didn't see it, and you have a personal grudge against Uwe Boll.

I for one found the move very entertaining, so much so that after renting the DVD to see it, I bought the DVD. I feel the costumes fit the period it was supposed to be in, bad wigs and all.

The story line did not seem to deviate from the story it was supposed to portray. (Having not ever played the game itself I don't know what the story line in the game is.) As for issues with continuity, every film has continuity issues. Just take a sampling of the goofs listed in IMDb.

My advice to anyone who would see this movie: MAKE YOUR OWN DECISION AS TO WEATHER YOU LIKE THE MOVIE OR NOT.

I dislike egotistical jerks that think they are the end all be all of movie critics and try to tell other people what to think."
1530,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I tried. I really did, but just no. Couldn't find a good thing about it really.

1. Wardrobe: Cheap leathers, dress-up type wigs, really fake fake blood, dull and obvious prop blades, phony vampire fangs and why is Rayne's outfit made of muted and loose leather? O_o I don't give a care what the year is! Skintight PVC is the only way to go! If her butt isn't shiny, then what the hell is it!? 2. Voice acting wasn't convincing and neither was the lip-syncing at times. 3. A better cast could've been obtained if a better director had taken the job. 4. The sets were sparsely furnished, cheap and the background effects didn't flow into a form of realism. 5. No deep character development which is necessary for any movie that's based off another form of media (like a video game). This movie would've been better if you didn't have to know the history of the game to understand what was going on. 6. Terrible script. It often tried too hard to use words that didn't belong and left me flabbergasted when they used ones that needed to be replaced in the most obvious of manners. ""The sunsets set the sky on fire."" Give me a break. How about... ""The setting sun sends the night sky into a blazing inferno of majestic beauty."" A bit over the top, yes, but so are a lot of aspects of the movie. 7. Question. Why does Rayne have a borderline English accent? She seems more east-coast attitude in the game. Just because they're in ancient times, doesn't mean they have to warp her personality to match the archaic theme. The spunk and fire she holds via game would've worked in an interesting why if it had been kept for the film. She's too soft-spoken and almost genial which doesn't seem right. 8. As expected in an Uwe Boll picture, there were quite a few editing flaws. How do Rayne's blades magically appear on the ground after a swing from a creature when they were not heard clattering to the stone floor and she had been using them to inspect his necklace only a moment before the attack? Ah, movie magic. 9. My god. The fight scenes are atrocious. Way too much blood, gore and guts for this sort of movie. Now me, I'm a huge fan of over the top blood spray, gutted bodies dangling from the ceiling and heads rolling around a courtyard but only in the right film. Battle Royale, tastefully over the top in an amusing way; Bloodrayne, blood bath in a tub made entirely of excrement (i.e. the gore was crappy). Of course that's expected from a bad zombie film director. 10. Since when was Bloodrayne about harems of beautiful love slave women and jiggling boobies!? Oh wait... Juggy mode does come to mind... But still, it seemed so out of place to have that much smut laced in with an otherwise violence-based video game turned movie. 11. The ending was left with absolutely nothing. Not even a final dialog from Rayne's point of view which would've went well with her series of flashbacks. This man has no vision. 12. Uwe Boll. What more needs to be said?"
1531,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"The only real gripe I had with this movie is that the lines and line delivery are totally B movie quality.

The fight scenes were better than a lot of action movies, even if some of the gore was over the top. (I saw the Not Rated version) The scenery was pretty good, and Kristanna Loken looked good as Rayne. (But then, she just plain looks good, so what can you expect?) Personally, I think Ewe Boll is a very talented director who's trying to make English speaking movies in spite of the fact it is not his primary language.

The line deliveries just don't sound right, and a lot of the conversations just don't quite flow or "
1532,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Despite some truly awful acting and dialog, this film is not as bad as critics led us to believe. The plot, though weak, was just strong enough to keep the story moving along and keep me interested. The motivation of Rayne's quest is understandable, convoluted as it is, but understandable. The film contains great action sequences of sword fighting a spurting, and i do mean spurting, blood and guts. One thing we do learn from the opening credits is that Meatloaf Aday is in this film. And let me tell you this, he needs to stick to his singing! My only complaint, other than the horrible script and acting, was the ending, which obviously set up for a sequel. I was, and still am very confused by the ending. Even the commentary didn't shed any light on the matter for me. At any-rate, the film was still was films should be, a fun t"
1533,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Compared to his other two ""masterpieces"" this is actually his only watchable movie. It's not great by any means, but it provides some sort of entertainment. Kristina Loken is really attractive and she plays her part well and Ben Kingsley is a good bad guy.I admit I've never played the video games so I don't know how it relates to the video game, because the previous scripts for House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark barely had anything to do with the games. Those scripts were very weak and the movies just fell down flat. Bloodrayne actually has an interesting character some high end digital effects and some good gore scenes. Nod bad for a satruday rainy afternoon. 2 and a half stars out of f"
1534,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I was supremely disappointed by the casting choice of the main character in this film. I had hoped it would be okay before I began watching the movie, but within the first ten minutes, I was thinking to myself ""Why on earth did they cast such an awful actress in this emotional part?"" Her tearful cries are far from heartbreaking--in fact, I'd say they're more eardrum-breaking if you get what I'm saying. She sounds like a cat doing an impression of a dog drowning in chocolate sauce. A really bad impression.

After she's done screaming and writhing in obviously-fake emotional pain, the movie gets slightly better. The rest of the acting (with the exception of Michelle Rodriguez, who has only ever played one good role, Rain in ""Resident Evil"") is pretty good, but obviously low-budget and not top-notch. The acting is really my main concern.

Visually, this movie is reasonably gorgeous. The cinematography isn't very impressive, but it's better then some I've seen, and the camera quality is superb on my 38in TV. The graphics look good, and the stunts are well done, but the blood looks really fake and ruined the moment a few times. The story is fairly true to the video games, but isn't nearly as satisfying. Rayne kicks a lot less ass in this film then she does in the games. A lot. I blame that on Kristianna. Moving on... The set design is quite satisfying, and the costumes are acceptable if not good.

This movie is FAR BETTER then the last movie I watched, which was ""The Wickerman"" starring Nicolas Cage. Sad, isn't it? Someone should redo this film with a better cast and a bigger budget, and then maybe it'd be okay. For now, though, I'm saying stay away unless you love BloodRayne or not-that-great, B-grade movies. If you just like vampires, not b-grade movies or video games, don't bother."
1535,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I agree with everything glennsouthall said in the above-mentioned review. I really only wanted to say that that was one of the most entertaining reviews I have ever read! It was worth sitting through the movie for the the opportunity to read it! Well done and thank you.

That said, I must reiterate, ""Bloodrayne"" was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. For my money there is nothing better that a really well written/directed/acted vampire movie, and there is nothing worse than a really bad one. This one was the worst. The script was dreadful. There was no character development to speak of. It seems that the director could not decide which of the various formulae relevant to the genre he wanted to apply and so tried to use bits from them all. The result was a plot that did not hang together. This was compounded by the fact that the person responsible for continuity appeared to have been on holiday during the making of this movie

If you will pardon the pun, ""Bloodrayne"" sucks!"
1536,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"First hello all ... sorry for my poor English...

1-I don't recommend this movie.

2- VERY VERY BAD EFFECTS .BAD SWORDS .Swords without blades!!!!!!!!!( WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?) .Body's blood are the worst....

.Vampire effects are bad,... better in Bufy vampire slayer(Haha) .Bad computer effects 3- Bad Stunts and sword masters.... and all weapons are very fake..

4-The Actors...

.Billy Zane: Same act in all movies (bored) .Michelle Rodriguez: Please!!!!! THE WORST MACHO WOMEN...in all movies ... good body (hollywood style but acting is BAD) .Ben Kingsley: Poor Ben in this movie...

.Michael Madsen (No act capacity... :( and fat for action movie ) ......

5- they dress sexy clothes for ancient time (a typically error) 6- THE GOD...

ALL castles and scenography ,landscapes are the best.

Sorry for my hard critic. :)"
1537,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Kritanna Loken stars as Rayne a vampire who can get by without drinking human blood and who looks to kill her father, who raped her mother, along the way she is aided by vampire hunters led by Michael Madsen, Michelle Rodriguez, Michael Pare and Matt Davis. However there is also something about various body parts which give vampires power and so on. (Ben Kingsley is the head honcho vampire who looks not like the Oscar winner but more like a robotic clone) Bloodrayne comes together with a cast list that admittedly sounds pretty cool. You have a great cast however Uwe Boll directs them with such ridiculous circumstance that you can see the sweat of embarrassment slide down their brows. Michael Pare has 3 minutes of screen time and looks as if he was trying to audition for the Three Dog Night story, Michael Madsen looks oddly like Howard Stern without the wrinkles and frighteningly enough is Meat Loaf who looks as if he was paying tribute to the Rock Me Amadeus video. What is even more shocking is that this is all boring. You would think that any movie that the actors I had just listed would contribute to non-stop hilarity but sadly it doesn't. Worst of all is the end which for some reason goes into a long flashback depicting what Rayne has seen. It is as if Boll was afraid that audiences had forwarded to the climax and so he decided to sting us with what he missed. It is a mess to behold since things make no sense and the movie is just so terminally boring. Boll should probably stick to making porn at least there his confusing camera angles and lack of coherent story telling would be ignored by viewers looking to satisfy their uh, needs. However given the sex scene in this movie and the one in Alone In The Dark, one assumes that even porno is out of his league.

Just another wasted point in my life. The plot is weak. The fight scenes were comical at best, and the sex scene seemed to have no point with the rest of the film it was pointless. And all this led up to one of the worst endings I've ever seen. I feel my intelligence has been insulted that the cast and crew felt this film was suitable for viewing. Somewhere someone in the production of this film should have said lets rethink this one. For this film to be based on a pretty good game, they should have come up with a better plot. I'll never see anything from this director again. I want a ref"
1540,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Consider this, friend. Uwe Boll is the world's greatest producer. No,no, no, hear me out. Somehow he continually conjures money in extreme sums to make some of the worst movies the world has ever seen, and when he's finished, there's always somebody else waiting to give him more for his next project. Bloodrayne cost $25 mill. His next, Dungeon Siege, cost $60 mill. Who keeps giving this guy cash? Bloodrayne stars one hit wonder, Kristanna Loken (of T3 fame) as, well, Bloodrayne, a half vampire, half human hot-chick floating about a (presumably, although I don't know for sure) fantasy land. She has to save the world from eternal damnation by...doing something. To be honest, the plot is so ill-conceived that I lost interest and only kept watching to see how bad it actually got. Michael Madsen forgets all the good work he done on Kill Bill Vol. 2 and reverts back to acting so wooden it makes Chuck Norris look like an Oscar candidate. Michelle Rodriguez ponce's around delivering her lines with the same conviction as an after dinner mind would. Ben Kingsley. Wow. How the mighty fall from grace. From Oscar gold in Ghandi to looking like and old man dressing in his grandmothers wig and clothes, his role is reduced to an embarrassing cameo. All in all, Bloodrayne doesn't really have that much going for it. Not even the bloody (and I mean bloody) battle scenes could hold my interest. That said, though, I know there will be a few of you out there, like myself, who will put themselves through torture just to say you survived another Dr Boll film. Now, if only they'd sell T-Shirts that said that..."
1541,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Uwe Boll recently challenged his critics to a boxing match to put an end to all the bad things said about his films (which inspired me to review his films here). Doesn't resorting to fists sort of admit defeat on the intellectual level? I've got a more appropriate challenge in mind: a bout, not with fists but with cameras. I'm calling out Uwe Boll. Each challenger gets a small budget, a camera, a crew, and a short time to make a short film. When the films are completed they are both presented to the judging panel at Cannes. May the best director win. I'm not worried, because I know I could make a better film than any of the Boll films I've seen (for all I know ""Blackwoods"" will be ""Citizen Kane"", but I doubt it).

Nothing boosts my confidence better than a film as depressingly bad as ""BloodRayne"". Before you notice Boll's name, the others give you hope for the potential: Guinevere Turner (""American Psycho"", ""The L Word""), Ben Kingsley, Billy Zane, Udo Kier, Michael Madsen and for some Michelle Rodriguez and Kristina Loken. Once again, the source is a game, resulting in the usual lame plots and outfits, but this is not always the kiss of death. I'd like to think that Turner's script was probably a pretty solid piece of writing to start with So, it's the middle ages again and humans have a big problem with vampires. Gandhi plays Kagan, King of the Vampires and father (by way of rape, so say the flashbacks) of Rayne (Loken), a half vampire (like ""Blade""), which are called dhampirs in this film's universe. Sebastian and Vladamir (Davis and Madsen) are vampire hunters on Rayne's trail after she escapes from the circus. Meanwhile she's collecting body parts from a dead vampire, which Kingsley also needs for some kind of vampire supremacy and to walk in daylight (like ""Blade""). Anyhow, the vampire hunters and the half-vampire join forces and set out on a quest to defeat the king of the vampires.

So, what could possibly go wrong with that? For one, a budget of $25 million. Some incredible things can be done on a small budget, just look at the films of Scorsese (especially ""Last Temptation""), George Miller, Joe Carnahan, or even Samuel Fuller. Unfortunately, Uwe Boll's name does not belong with the others. Yes, this film was shot on location in Romania, using real castles and helicopter shots. The trouble is that Boll's inept camera makes the locations look fake and the helicopter shots aren't enough to create that epic feel they were trying for. Meanwhile the tasteless dungeon sex scene and the excessive gore (especially in the last five minutes of the director's cut) remind us that this is exploitation. Exploitation dressed up in CG, millions of dollars, star cameos, and Romanian castles is almost worse because it could have been something more. That is, it could have been something more if not for Uwe Boll.

Not only did this DVD have Boll's usual sad commentary (this time joined by Loken and friends), but it also had a feature called ""Dinner with Uwe Boll"" which is Boll eating dinner with a couple in their dining room and talking about how he got into film. I found it very telling that Boll said he dropped out of film school because of all the theory and the ""talking, talking, talking"". Yes, sir Mr. Boll, your genius is evident. I'll be standing by to sing my praise for ""In The Name of the King"", ""Seed"", ""Postal"", ""Far Cry"", and whatever other video game movies you manage to churn out before Germany abolishes the tax shelter and the investors desert you."
1542,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"This movie is the most retarded piece of garbage that i have ever seen. It completely disses (as do all uwe boll movies inspired by games) the game which is excellent. Uwe Boll should just make porn movies because then people wont think bad about bad acting since most porn stars act badly anyway. He also wont have to worry his head about special effects and might even spend the same amount on the porn stars as for the bigger stars. As soon as this movie picks up (which is not very often) it lasts for a few minutes an then gets dragged back down by some nonsense Uwe Boll decided to add. The reason his movie got a 4 is because the level of crap in it had me laughing so hard i couldn't rate it lower. if u want to laugh or watch a good comedy then this is one of the best movies that u can choose. I wanted to demand the video store for my money back and am personally glad that the Halo movie went to Peter Jackson (director of the lord of the rings trilogy) an not this thing that claims to be a director. how does he get any fans anyway. and who sponsors his movies anyway, it can only be people with no good movie tastes or people that only want to laugh more at his trash he calls movies. if u see this movie then u must agree with me. if not then don't rent or buy it, trust me its utter garbage"

Any true movie fan wouldn't immediately hate a movie because its 'not a good movie'. All that really matters is its entertaining value. Laugh at the cheesy lines, make fun of the acting. I have always gave bad movies a chance, but one can only take so much. I mean, line after line, continuous bad acting, bad fighting scenes... it can get a little old. Its like a comedian not changing his stand up routine after 20 years, you end up thinking to yourself... didn't I just see this? I'm really amazed that Uwe Boll still is making these movies.

1544,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"OK, I was a fan of the game, and they did an acceptable job of casting the part of Rayne, but the rest is absolutely putrid. Unbelievably bad (and 100% unconvincing) acting, cheezy fight sequences, lame music queuing, choppy film flow, and painfully fake gore effects.

I picked up this movie (director's cut btw) for a rental without realizing that the same director of the Alone in The Dark movie did this one. Uwe Boll is completely talentless, a fresh community college grad could do better.

There is no way Kristanna Loken (or anyone for that matter) was trained for any good length of time for the action sequences, they all look like LARPers at a convention.

The flow of the film left it feeling disconnected, rushed, and incongruent. Scenes like the one where Rayne staggers out of her cell and mounts Sebastian, seemingly for no reason at all (and after a nightmare none-the-less) left you with your mouth open from the horror of the awful lameness and feeling insulted of your intelligence.

The gore effects made me feel like i was watching a college-made horror film as rubbery as the body parts looked and as gushing as the blood was.

Oh yeah the camera work/effects sucked too.

...and what the crap is with the last 8min? I want my 1hr 38min back and I want it now with interest.

If you are looking for a torture film for reasons of initiation, well, you found it because this deserves a zero Thanks for a waste of my time Uwe, now stop ruining video game movies and go back to film school.

1548,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Bloodrayne is actually not such a bad movie, it has some flaws in it's storytelling, and the dialogue at times is very poorly executed. But it is definitely not worth the low rating it has received by so many. Which leads me to believe that people vote against the director totally, and solely out of spite.

This 2.X rating has nothing to do with the quality of the movie, at all. It is actually an average movie, and actually better than eg. ""Van Helsing"", or the Dracula 2000-series, and only slightly worse than Blade.

I think Kingsley portrays the old vampire perfectly, and the other actors performance aren't so bad either. The environments are very excellently picked for the atmosphere, and the music in it is excellent.

With better photography, telling, and some more focus on writing a better dialogue, this could've been a lot better. It certainly has potential.

Oh, credit to Meat Loaf, who made an excellent portrayal of a slothfully vampire in this."

I know he's not on Hollywood's hot A list of actors but his effort was so poor I almost questioned if it was intentional or not. Watching him slowly stagger through his lines gave me the impression I was watching a really bad William Shatner/Christopher Walken impersonation on Saturday Night Live. Not to mention his delivery reminded me of an emotionless Data played by Brent Spiner on Star Trek. Like Data, Madsen appears incapable of using conjunctions when he speaks.

I find it hard to believe that such an awful performance could go unnoticed by the casting director, the director, other cast members, Madsen himself, and anyone else who happened to be present while Michael destroyed every scene he was in. This may sound harsh, but his performance is so bad I suggest you watch this movie just to see it first hand. It's like passing by a bad car accident on your way to work, you don't want to look, but you just can't look away.

In short, Madsen's performance made a bad movie worse."

Michelle's accent was laughable. Michael delivered lines like he was dead, which is his normal acting way, but in this role he needed to be a swashbuckling vampire killer, and he wasn't. another thing that bothered me was meatloaf, hello people, meatloaf is cool, but he looked awful and was not suited for a wig and fangs. and the last thing I found I didn't like about the movie was the way the lines were delivered. It was like they read every single word, word for word.. ""I will take that"" instead of ""I'll take that"". It was like they were reading them word for word off a cue card.

i don't follow this director much, don't know much about him, but from what everyone else's says this is pretty much the way all his movies are. its really not a bad movie, it just had flaws. I didn't hate it... I watched the whole movie and found the scenery and costumes very accurate and enjoyable.

Bad editing has made an entourage of great actors look stupid. It did not come together as a whole, it was a bunch of scenes pieced together in the worst possible way. I had trouble watching this entire movie, but curiosity got the better of me. I liked the video game, so I treated this movie like a video game and it helped a little. You can tell the actors gave their all, but this is a prime example of how post production can go awry. I hope they don't attempt to make a sequel, as they normally do with garbage.

The lead character that played Rayne was perfect for the part. The rest of the cast were top notch actors in their own right. But when the director is not sure what they want or how to either convey that thought or get the cast ""into the part"", then Bloodrayne is the result.

1561,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Ok...first off, is this Ben Hur? Braveheart? Or the Ten Commandments? Nope. This in no way is on par with the greatest period movies of all time. Nor was it intended so.

Second, when reading the reviews it is painfully obvious that people:
...don't like Uwe Boll and thus could not judge the movie on its merits, or
...are video game fans who had very specific expectations for this movie and again, were unable to look beyond that, or
... compare this movie to some of the best and most expensive genre movies, or
...just flat out picked it apart for everything it was not without looking at what it is.


It's stunning to read such bad reviews on a movie that simply was not bad. As mentioned, this is not a huge mega budget period film, nor is it a faithful and true recreation of the game. It was not intended to be either, yet people continue watching and reviewing it as if it were. The fact is, not many directors would take on such a film with the budget it had and a) do any better, b) leave it as bloody and violent, or c) get the names that this film has. I don't know about you, but I love medieval (or earlier) period films and they are not made nearly as much as I would like. Why? Because they're extremely expensive to do properly. Now maybe you would rather not have one at all, opposed to getting something that is above average in nearly every regard compared to the majority of similar films released in recent years. Sure, there's always going to be (the rare) exceptions, but for the most part they are simply nowhere near as good as this. That's not to say this deserves awards, but if people insist on comparing (falsely I might add) then this is all worth noting.

So...the movie. I cannot speak to its affinity toward the game, as I couldn't care less, but as a story, it's fine. It's rather cookie cutter, straight out of the earlier sword and sandal films or other medieval supernatural films, or for that matter, any period vampire movie or even newer vamp movie. Surprisingly, I haven't heard a single comparison to the Resident Evil or Underworld franchises, which surprises me. But I digress.

The production is on par with the budget it was given. Period. There are some high points and some not so high points, but the pace is swift and keeps the characters moving toward their ultimate goals. The acting is average, at best, and could be better, especially considering the number of ""seasoned"" actors in the cast. It certainly wasn't as ""piss poor and awful"" as others suggest. Good? Maybe not quite, but awful? Nope.

Special fx are decent, though done in a manner that leaves little to linger on screen for more than a brief flash. Costumes and sets were enjoyable to look at. Some beautiful camerawork on the large-scale sweeping panoramas, and the lighting is equally as well done.

All in all, this is a very avaerage flick, with some above average sequences and a few below average sequences. Anybody who reviews it as poorly as many have, are hating purely for reasons outside the boundaries of the movie itself.

Notes on parental content:


I dunno folks...Bloodrayne is certainly not going to win any awards, but I felt it very entertaining, honestly...from start to finish. Not sure that I would buy the film either, but I could easily watch it again down the road a piece.

My advice is to watch it for what it is - a loosely based interpretation on a video game franchise; and I do mean loosely. Enjoy the costumes, the action (of which some is actually good), and the general storyline that involves castles & vampires. There just aren't that many watchable flicks with this byline."
1562,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"This is a movie that you can either enjoy or hate (or both!), but in a nutshell it is the combination of terrible direction, mediocre script and a surprisingly good cast. Some scenes can make you laugh (despite the intention of the filmmaker), other shots are good, aerial ones for example. Others are a joke. Acting can go from decent to terrible. There is something that keeps me wondering and that is having people like Kingsley and Chaplin here. I think it is perfect for a group of young men, an afternoon with friends, having bowls of popcorn, screaming and laughing, if only to see Kristanna as Bloodrayne (there is also some -most welcomed- nudity). Still wondering what Ben Kingsley is doing here, maybe paying some bills? yeah, we all need to work for a liv"
1563,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Hollywood has a really corny way of telling the story. O.K., you've got your Romanian vampires (duh!), a tyrannic father for Rayne (maybe some counseling would help) who wants to conquer the world, but first, he must kill his daughter (if she won't join him -> ""Luke, I am your father"").

About Rayne, she's being held captive by Gypsies who exploit her weakness toward water and her ability to regenerate after consuming blood (do they even know she's a vampire ?) and everything seems to be O.K. for her, until one of them tries to rape her (the films' main event seems to be rape - Kagan raped her mom, that dude tried to rape her, but not long after that she ends up having wild sex with somebody that was depriving her of some people rights too)so then, she realizes that she must kill her father (and all the vampires as well).

I would really like to talk with the guy that wrote the script, cause he doesn't seem to know much about the game (or vampires, for that matter):

1. Rayne and Water don't mix (she takes the eye of Beliar in her and so she doesn't take damage from water - that's crap!In the game, when that happens, she gains extruded view, not to mention the action takes place in Argentina !)

2. When did vampires start having sex and furthermore - having kids ?!

OK, this is the part that bothers me the most. So, Rayne is very hungry,because she hasn't been feeding for the last days, she exits her cage, she's about to feed on the guy (that would've been more fun and realistic), but instead, she settles out for a roll in the hey. Man, I know you've got to make a living, but did you ever think about what the gamers would think ? Yeah, Kristana is pretty hot, but if I wanted to get some action , I would have watched something else (don't want to mention here)

3. The action of the game begins in New Orleans, but as many ""horror writers"" , the ""scripter"" places the action in Romania - long live Bram Stoker !

4. Where did all the characters in the movie came from ? Except for Kagan and a slight imitation of Mince, there is no resemblance to the actual characters in the game.

5. Kristanna Loken and Blood Rayne don't actually look like, except for the costume (and by the way, she should've lost some more weight on the belly and the thies)

I am really looking forward to see what the other gamers feel about what I've said here."

1566,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Okay. So, there is a huge stigma about Uwe Boll and what this particular German director has done to Video Game Movies. I didn't know about this until after i watched the movie so I'll just give you the rundown of how i thought the movie went along. I thought that the dialog was poorly written, yet sometimes well executed. The story had more holes than a cheese grater and enough cheese to boot. Now, my expectations have been low for video game movies since the likes of Mario Bros and Doom. But this didn't even meet my low expectations. The use of gore didn't seem to have any other purpose other than to be there which... if this were some sort of horror flick... would have been fine. But it just seemed laughable. As in me and my family were laughing. It looked ridiculous. The problem is it's not even bad enough to be good. it's not a so bad it's good. or so indie it's good. this is a movie that is so bad it's horrendous. don't even waste your money.

that's three strike Mr. Boll. in my books... you're out. I'm just glad you didn't get the rights to a game like Halo... who knows what would happen!"

1569,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"A few weeks ago, a friend of mine convinced me to watch ""Alone in the Dark"". I will probably regret that day for a long time, and to say the least, I was forced to question my taste in friends. Little did I know that I would stumble upon this movie, unsuspecting and oblivious to its director.

I will say one thing for Uwe Boll. His name should be on the front image of every single one of his movies' DVD releases. In bold. Probably in some kind of neon color. Maybe twice, just to make sure.

This movie is just bad on so many levels. If you are looking for Tarantino-ish amounts of blood, look no further. But where Tarantino manages to overdose on the gore in a manner that makes you hoarse with laughter, Boll manages to actually make you want to curl up and cry yourself to sleep. The sheer terror.

And the bad acting. Boll persistently manages to get big names to work on his films. The warm, lovable, peaceful image of Ben Kingsley as Ghandi will forever be tainted by his utter lack of facial muscles and the offensively bad hair styling in Bloodrayne.

The bad lines. ""You are such a suck-up!"" Do I really need to say more? The movie tries (and, unsurprisingly, fails) to carry its lines in a cloak&dagger-ish manner, to be repeatedly interrupted by comments like the one mentioned. This even beats Ultraviolet's ""Are you mental?"".

In a world of great injustice, of people dying by the thousands each moment, of a cloned human as the leader of one of its most powerful nations, and a tradition of blaming violence on video games and rock music, Uwe Boll will be allowed to continue to make awful movies. But maybe, just maybe, IMDb will implement the option of giving a movie a negative rating."
1570,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Yeh right! More like CRAPFEST. I wish i could give negative numbers because they would surely apply to this piece of crap. The special effects were the most awful junkiest retarded special effects. Some of the gore effects were MILDLY convincing and that is where this movie gets a 1. The dialogue was 1 of the most terrible dialogues that i was ever suffered to sit thru. I wanted 2 jam a scissors in my eardrum! Worst of all was Meatloaf's terrible acting (if u can even call this crap that). Ben Kingsley was also terrible and wooden. The only semi-passable acting was from Kristanna Loken who plays Rayne and thats not saying much! This brings me 2 another topic. The random sex scene. Rayne wakes up and has sex with Matt Davis against a jail cell. It had nothing 2 do with the crappy plot at all. BTW this was by far the most realistic part of the movie. From this scene, we can tell that Toilet.. I mean Uwe Boll was desperate 2 make a quick buck because he knew that his newest and greatest crapfest would not make much money at all. So finally, I must tell u that if u see this piece of junkola, wipe your feet on it or throw it in the dumpster as quickly as possible or in the Toilet Boll. And will sum1 stop Bowl from making these crappy movies and ruining great game franchises. Stop making movies Boll! They suck!!!!!! Well folks this is the end of this tragic review. I would go on 4 years about the level of crap displayed in this movie, but there is not enough years in a millennium 2 do this. Stay FAR FAR FAR away from this movie!!!!!!!!!"
1571,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Any movie that seems endlessly long after 40 minutes can't be good. It was dreadful acting all the way through, the cameramen obviously just plonked the camera on some boxes and let it roll through the whole movie in one place, cause there sure as hell wasn't any movement! However one of the most humongous flaws in the movie was however the fact that it introduced new characters and settings all the freaking time!!! Every 5 minutes a new setting and about 10 different characters, that we could well do without! Other annoying aspects of the movie: I was trying to take Michelle Rodriguez's father's character seriously, believe me... I tried... However I failed miserably, but I'm pretty sure everyone else did as well, so I don't feel to sad about that fact.

And what is with all the incredibly fake English accent's in the movie??? Were they trying to sound medieval, or sophisticated or what!? In any case they failed miserably.

In conclusion albeit a sad sad excuse for a movie, sometimes I saw a glimmer of hope, some places the dialog actually fitted, but they were so scarce that more than a 2 it couldn't be!"

1573,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I can't say i'll ever understand how people could say this is a good video-game based movie. the only thing similar to the ""Bloodrayne"" games,is the name it self. Story is misleading from what's it's supposed to be(and it's not all about the Nazis, there are Bloodrayne 2 as well, for those not knowing). The movie is basically effect-less considering in the Game, Bloodrayne, would be practically ""Invincible"". In the movie, My Granny could bet Bloodrayne. No Blood magic/powers is used in the movie, it's like U Boll, never actually seen or heard about the game. Bloodrayne should be a half Vamp, that would be overpowered, highly agile(no high jumping in movie, or scaling of any sort), able to control the magic or potence of the blood, for using it's power. Etc. There is a unlimited number of things that isn't as it should in the movie. The costume however, is similar(sorta, alike, but not totally) The scenery and the era is about right tho, so no complaints there. In all, this movie is a bottom-scraper. Simply because, 1. No alike the game characteristics. 2.Effectless and motionless. 3. Bad acting(probably because of scripting and directing etc).

The movie do how ever have good scenery though. Good actors, though wrong movie. Someone mentioned that of Rayne would die if in touch of water. Well, in some stories, if looking up on vampiric history, there would be tales of the waters around the world would be ""blessed"" so that fiends not of this world would have more, shall we say ""problems"" to go about? Anyhow, this is how the game was made, vampires getting damaged by water, to make it more difficult for the gamer to get around, as there would be multiple water obstacles for him or her to get around. So there is the answer to that."
1574,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"NO! Not so bad!

Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Kristanna Lokek, Michelle Rodriguez is such a good actors! This is films with good actors and bad director! This is a film by PC game and game was very similar! I know I played! Also much blood, trash and other... This game was made for teens and movie was filmed for teens! And this game help Uwe Boll like very good PR!

1575,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Kristanna Loken, Michelle Rodriguez, Michael Madsen and Ben Kingsley star in this movie based on a video game. We all know that movies based on games always make good movies, right? Well, it holds true this time also. This movie sucks like a hoover.

Uwe Boll isn't know for any big master pieces and this movie isn't one. The dialogue is uninspired and full of clichés; ""Keep your friends close and your enemies closer"" and other stuff like that is delivered time and time again. There are also a few sword fights in this movie, but the less said about them the better. They are poorly choreographed, the actors just throw around their weapons with no force behind them and it's just not believable. What you do get is blood, lots of it and in close up. Doesn't make the movie any better though.

Actually I won't bother writing any more about this movie. The only positive thing with the movie is the looks of Kristanna and Michelle, but they can't save this über turkey.

Vherna rating: Stay away!"
1576,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. This movie is just god-awful. Really really stinky. If you have the patience to watch it all the way through to the end (and I suggest having something else to do on the side to ease the pain) you'll just find yourself confused. Who is the lead character? Who is the bad guy? What era is this colossally bad flick supposed to be taking place in? And most importantly, who designed the women's costumes? It's early goth meets ""I'm having a fat day"" clothing. What a mess! The only redeeming thing about this is that there are some great actors in it doing a really bad job. How is this redeeming? Well, because I have a sick sense of humour and it makes me feel kinda good to know that the extraordinary Ben Kingsley and always amusing Michael Madsen do crappy work too. Perhaps they needed to pay for the summer home, buy another horse... who knows? But nobody chose this puppy for the script.

If you get bored watching the film (and you will) a fun way to pass the time is to try and figure out what accent Michelle Rodriguez is attempting. She varies from sounding like a 100% west coast American to a tape player with the batteries running out.

This is fun to watch with people who like to heckle. And while drinking. Don't watch sober - you're only hurting yourself."
1577,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Um Uh This was terrible! I can't believe how bad it was! This was as bad or even worse than some of those crappy TV ""Volcano"" type mini series movies that you see, well at least hear about ever once in a while!

I did laugh however throughout the entire movie because it was so bad!!

Just a couple of quickies!!!!

Example 1 - The guy getting chopped in half, falling backwards and while falling, you can see his legs! Example 2 - End of the movie, she is given a cup of ""blood"". She starts to drink and already has blood on her lips and as she drinks ""blood"" starts to drip and run down her chest. IT'S TWO DIFFERENT COLORS!!!!!!!!!!!! Obviously chocolate syrup! DUH Do they really think we are that stupid?????????

The best part of this movie was watching her tits bounce up and down as she was getting f-ed!

What a horrible waste of an hour and 45 minutes! This director should be shot!"
1578,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Who knew Uwe Boll (who's name I always want to transpose with former Dallas Maverick center/bench warmer/useless stiff Uwe Blab) had so much in common with Malick. This is the third Boll film I've watched and it might be his best. At the very least it comes through in the grue factor. It's interesting to see so many actor's slumming it. Could there be that many actors with alimony checks due? At one point Michelle Rodriguez comes across a young woman who has been bitten by a vampire and calls for her vampire killing partners to come and see with a line reading that can only be classified as vaguely urgent. Everyone seems supremely disinterested, except perhaps the lead actress who just seems awkward. It does have geysers of blood, crushed heads and the such. So much so that it becomes boring. Uwe Boll is the best definition of deep hurting.

DVD Note: They have a feature on the DVD called 'Dinner with Uwe.' A young man and woman sit and eat dinner while Uwe talks about his film career. The young man and woman are never introduced. The young woman says nothing until Uwe brings up 'Kentucky Fried Movie' at which point she enthusiastically states ""I love that movie!"" What an odd bonus feature. I turned it off after five minutes, to leave myself a small bit of mystery. Who are these Uwe dinner companions? And why do they hate movies so, so much?"
1579,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,Warning: Spoi
1580,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Please forgive me for the harsh review, but you will understand this if you are fan of the game or good movies in general. This movie receives a 1 out of 10 from me for the following:

1) Storyline, plot, and characterizations of Rayne, Kagan, and the Brimstone society were poorly done. For being a prequel, this movie really did lose any sense of what the video-games were about. If the writer would have played the games, got an understanding of what Bloodrayne was about, then the background information and plot would have been more correctly told and portrayed. The plot was not well-put together. The story should have stayed near the consistency with the game, not trying to make a prequel. I feel that was a bad part in the first place.

2) Actor portrayals of the characters were NOT convincing. The actors/actresses really seem to be acting half-heartedly. Upon reviewing the characters and the actors/actresses portraying them, I feel that the casting was not right. Even though I am fan of the actors/actresses in this film, I just don't feel this was a good film with some of their previous roles that they have engaged in. Brings a good question, how did Uwe Boll get some of these well-known actors/actresses to act in his films? The point is the casting could have been better. Rayne should have oozed with sensuality, with the confidence of a trained assassin, like Selena in Underworld or Alice from Resident Evil. Both characters were portrayed with a confidence, Kate Beckinsale and Milla Jovovich making the roles as believable as they could. Each word said, each punch punched, each gun fired, every blade swung, looked and felt real or believable. This film needed that...it felt like Kristanna Loken was holding back and unsure of herself.

3) The lighting and camera angles in this film was consistent with Uwe Boll's other films. This is very unfortunate, as the setting and plot are completely stripped away of any effect that could have been created. For example, would Underworld have been such a good movie if it was all done with bright hues and showing characters in sunlight, brightly lit rooms, etc? No, the movie was supposed to be dark and broody, gave the sense of eeriness and the supernatural. This sets up the mood, makes the characters dark and mysterious, makes the costumes appear more sensual or realistic. The cinematographer should have known that or tried to achieve that. But, it's not entirely his fault as the director should have been pushing that more. ~sigh~ This should have been a SCI-FI channel movie, instead of a theatrical affair.

4) The props and action scenes in this movie would have been done better by a high school drama club. Aluminum swords, costumes not even worthy to be able a comic-book convention, and over use of nudity, bloody, and gore really took away from making this convincing. It was so disconcerting. Point of a good movie is to make the audience feel they are part of the movie, bringing to life another world. The action scenes focused entirely on the blood and gore, Kristanna Loken and the others looked unconvincing in any the scenes. The choreography was not even second-rate, it was one of the worst. ( With the exception of the unknown-monk in a particular scene that really knew what he was doing.) Other than that, it's the usual Uwe Boll style of emphasizing on blood and gore and not enough on the story, plot, and connecting the action scenes together properly.

5) The music in this movie was not bad, but the music NEVER stopped or felt were scored or unneeded in a scene. Even my friends and family that watched this movie was aggravated at the music was nonstop and commenting on how the music just didn't fit the mood of the scenes.

6) The death knell of any future movie franchises for Bloodrayne. With a character that could rival Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Blade, this could have been a very successful franchise for Majesco and the studio that produced this film. Such a disappointment that this will more than likely end any future endeavors that Bloodrayne could have had. Majesco should have held off and did their research, for example, Blizzard Entertainment recently found a studio for their product Warcraft. Warcraft has been around for nearly 10 or so years. It has taken Blizzard that long to find the correct studio they feel will do their product justice. I guarantee you that the Warcraft movie will be very well-done, making the Warcraft franchise even bigger and open up to future films. This should have been the case for Bloodrayne, but sadly...

I am a big fan of good cult-cheese movies, like Army of Darkness or Killer Klownz from Outer Space. This is doesn't even qualify as good cheese...it was that disappointing.

Out of my enjoyment of the game was the only reason I forced myself to watch this. Play the game, enjoy the story, the characterizations in the game are great. Just this video-game-made-movie, even in terms of a regular movie, was not worth the time that I spent watching."
1581,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,Warning: Spoi
1582,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"This is a review of the DVD version.

Basically it's a tale of Bloodrayne, a dhampir (half-human, half vampire, popularized by Blade, but actually a real legend, albeit in real folklore they could just sense vampires, they didn't have superhuman strength) who basically wants revenge on her vampire father, Ben Kingsly. She's being pursued by the forces of her father, along with a trio of vampire hunters headed by Michael Madsen and Michelle Rodriguez, who she eventually joins forces with.

It's set in the 16th Century, but is hardly historically accurate (and as an adaption of a video game, it was hardly meant to be). The movie is rather jerky, in that it doesn't transition smoothly from scene to scene, but there are leaps in what's going on. Little to no characterization, either. In a way, it reminds me a lot of Tsui Hark's movies. And like his movies, this movie actually looks very nice, cinematographically. Some really vivid colors, landscapes, etc.

There's quite a bit of fighting scenes and quite a bit of gore, but the fighting is all very fake looking.

On the surface the cast is pretty decent, but Michelle Rodriguez is the only one who actually acts or at least, takes it seriously. The lead actress seems to be a female version of Keanu Reeves - she has two expressions - confused and blank. Michael Madsen just is hard to take serious in a role like this. Meat Loaf looked like he had fun, mostly he just rolled about and fondled a gaggle of Romanian prostitutes, which I guess would be enjoyable.

It's not a terrible movie, just a fairly standard B movie. Not unlike something put out by Hammer studios in the early 70s, combined with the sword & sorcery movies of the early 80s. Possibly worth a rental if you are into such movies, but definitely not worth buying."
1583,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"i was excited about this movie just because i love Kristanna Loken (she's a hottie) but this movie was an terrible disappointment. it had so much potential of being great but was a complete and utter disaster.

i can't believe the line of actors who actually signed on to do this crap ... i mean Ben Kingsley, man what were you thinking? did you READ the script? i'm also a fan of Billy Zane too and poor guy -- from titanic to this? Michelle, say it ain't so? Girlfight, blue crush, resident evil ... what happened? just goes to show how important a director is - the sucky ones can even make good actors do terrible performances.

i think it would have been so much better if someone else directed and wrote it such as Len Wiseman(of Underworld fame). Such a great director and incredible writer. Yeah - I don't think there would be any ""my companion seems to be missing - I do not know what has become of him!"" i hope they don't let this guy direct any more movies and ruin the careers and any other up-and-coming stars. sorry Kristanna - hope you pick a better movie next time."
1584,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I can't lie about this movie. Ewe Boll has once again stunk up the movie market with his film-making. Just as Alone in The Dark, and House of The Dead before it. BloodRayne is another movie that by all means, shouldn't have been made in the first place. But, that's somewhat a shame.

A promising cast that had Kristanna Loken, Michael Madsen, Michelle Rodriguez and Ben Kinglsey only suffered from Boll's poor directing and the very static script.

But where this movie becomes a movie that no Vampire or heck, even medieval era movie fan should miss. Is the sheer fact that is is so bad, that it's brilliant.

The fighting, the acting, the relentless gore and the needless sex scene, it leads you on a roller coaster ride that you will joke about with your friends for years. I am not telling you that this is a movie you should go out and see. But it is a movie that you will enjoy, for the simple fact that it is so bad.

This movie is not a masterpiece. And if it's not even acknowledged for a Razzie, I will be heartily disappointed.

Props to Ewe Boll for his passionate film-making, he truly loves the work he does, even though most would say it's a passion he should abandon. He continues to put out movies that are consistently bad, and for that We should embrace him. Stop thinking along the lines of ""Ugh, Ewe Boll directed this. I'm not even going to bother"" and start thinking along the lines of ""Hey, the new Ewe Boll movie is out, let's she just what he did to make me go ""wow."" in amazement of truly poor film-making."" BloodRayne is not a good movie. It's not even okay. But it is great for being bad, the kind of bad everyone can love.

Thank you, Ewe Boll, you brought a video game movie to life I thought i'd never see, and you also amused and entertained me along the way. Even if Ihated the movie, and will probably never watch it again, I did enjoy watching it."
1585,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"OK, So I thought I might be tired of stereotypes of vampires and stuff as I really live here and I still remember the hype in the local press that the great stars are comin down from Hollywood to shoot this movie. I don't have to tell that this cast is one of the best I have seen in these kinds of movies. So here is the general idea: Mr. Boll (avant-garde director extraordinare) wanted so much to make this movie, oh it was his childhood dream. Collected some of the most talented and acclaimed actors (and some opposite of that) and made this terrible film. But This is not even a film, because films have a plot, have actors. A plot is something that makes you at least stay awake, an actor is somebody who knows his/her role. I don't want to tell that fi. Maidsen isn't an actor, but he is playing this one worse than Steven Seagal usually plays, who would had been a better choice as having a practice in playing such horrible parts (And Maidsen proved he is a good actor as Mr. Blonde). The others, I don't even wan't to mention them, I truly don't want to think at some of my favorite actors as jerks in gigalol costumes. It really seems that they where so frustrated, they allied to make a complete joke out of their roles, or this is how they protested? I wonder how they where lured to star in this movie (a free trip to Romania?) Bottom line: How is he doing it? How can he get a contract for a movie? Who gives him money? Yes I'm referring to Mr. Boll. David Lynch is fighting for money to make genial movies and this little piece of s*it is getting money for great titles like Alone in the dark. The only logical explanation I could find is, that he is making video game based movies. You read in the papers that a horrible picture was made and it is a shame to the (also not genial) game. So you think if you wasted $10 for the ticket or the rental, you should really try the game only to find out it is better than this movie.

Sorry, I'm really diffuse here at the ending, but I can't concentrate. Recalling this movie had killed my brain-cells, I can't type... ...DON'T W.. H.AT..CH I.TTTTT! Ps: If you have a good sense of humor don't miss it, you will laugh for 90 minutes, but only if you have it!"
1586,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"Granted it's no Schindler's list or big budget blockbuster but it's pretty good. The action is almost non stop, the story moves along at a decent pace and there's loads and loads of blood.

If you like other Uwe Boll films there's a chance you'll like this, it's a Diet Vampire film sort of the matrix of neck biter films, plenty going on but not too deep to bore you.

The acting isn't the best i've seen but all of the characters are interesting enough and Bloodrayne is played well even though the look from the video games isn't quite there. Plus bloodrayne never got her baps out in the game ;-)

1590,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I don't know what the heck happened but Uwe Boll has at last turned out a watchable, even enjoyable movie. Sure its not a great film, or maybe even a good film, but for those of us raised on ""bad but fun"" fantasy films like Hawk the Slayer, Ator, Sword and the Sorcerer as well as countless others this is a return to the days of old.

The plot has Rayne, a half Human Half Vampire breaking out of a circus where she is being held and going after the vampire king who fathered her. She is pursued by some vampire hunters who think she can help them in their own battles.

The script is uneven, the direction just passable but there is something in this film that somehow pulls it all together.

The biggest problem is the acting, some of which is non existent. The problem is that Uwe Boll doesn't cast until he's days from shooting so he can get the biggest names he can find with holes in their schedules (and who want/need some fast cash). The result of this is unevenness of performances that make you feel as though everyone is in different movies. Its runs from Udo Keir who is actually giving a performance, Michael Madsen who thinks he's in a western, Billy Zane who is in a comedy and Ben Kingsley who is out acted by one of the worst hairpieces of all time. Kingsley obviously took this for cash or thought his roll was that of a piece of lumber.(Clearly he's in the running for worst performance by an Oscar winner from the last 25 years award) Still somehow this works. No, its not great, but it is an earnest attempt at a fantasy film (and its light years better than some of the recent films like Beasts of Blood that have cropped up in the wake of Lord of the Rings, not to mention other video game movies like Doom).

If you like this sort of thing I give it a try, on cable if nothing else. Its not the best, not worst, but if you've seen Hawk, or Ator or Gor, then you might find yourself liking it."
1591,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"On its own and looked at logically, ""BloodRayne"" mostly falls apart like a house of cards in a hurricane. And even when compared to Uwe Boll's two previous efforts, ""Alone in the Dark"" and ""House of the Dead"", it's no classic. But in regard to the first scenario, it's rather fun destruction while it lasts. And in regard to the second scenario, the movie is more than passable--which, for Uwe Boll, is saying something.

I'm going to be a good sport and list the good first, because there's actually quite a decent chunk of it. There won't be any spoilers here or in the bad.

The film looks good. I don't quite know how that happened, but it did. There's the slight tinge of anonymity that I've noticed with all of Boll's films so far, which is to say that a good many of the shots were flat, completely evenly lit (almost sitcom-lit), and possibly shot at a blurrier frame rate. When it matters to the movie, though, the camera actually starts moving around, the lighting becomes more pronounced, and it's a marked improvement. As a final note, the visual effects were surprisingly good all-around; a vampire ashing midway through the movie is obviously intended as only a special effect, but it looks about identical to the similar ones used in all three ""Blade"" films. The only other CG effect sequence I can recall involves what must be giant spiked pinwheels.

About halfway through the movie, Loken's character arrives at the Brimstone Society's headquarters, and the ensuing section of the film is probably the best; each character save for one is at their peak in terms of development and actor/actress involvement, and there are actually scenes here that pick you up and carry you, however short the distance might be. In fact, the second half of ""BloodRayne"" is really where you can get a sense of what Boll was trying to do. And he succeeds, partially.

The music is a huge improvement. For once, it seems, Boll has gone with a composer, and the difference shows. Although I must confess I can't remember the rhythm of the main theme now, I do know that it stuck with me for a short time after viewing the film.

All of these are relatively minor points, except for the second one. The main reason why I kind of liked ""BloodRayne"" (and am giving it a 7) is because you can see a spark of life there, in the same way you can see it behind the screen in low-budget 1960s and 1970s monster flicks. There was effort here to try and make this a good film--more so than you could see with few other movies this year. And even the sequences that don't work (and there are a decent amount of them) have a low-rent, goofy kind of charm to them. ""BloodRayne"" is at its best in scenes like Rayne's memory of the sideshow sequence, her return to the Brimstone Society late in the film (which packs an existing if small punch that I really wasn't expecting), and a late plot point with Michelle Rodriguez's character that actually feels like it came from somewhere.

I've said this before. I suppose when looking at it on its own, ""BloodRayne"" is still a bad movie. But it's so many leaps and bounds above and beyond ""Alone in the Dark"" and ""House of the Dead"" that it merits a viewing."
1592,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"So, what happens when you take video game movie (always bad)+bad script+actors phoning in their performance+Uwe Boll? Bloodrayne.

Now I regularly watch Sci Fi's original movies, so I'm used to bad movies and I've generally learned how to enjoy them in their own way. But Bloodrayne was just bad. Nothing else, not funny-bad, not so-bad-it's-good, but bad.

And if all the failings weren't bad enough, all of the actors would vary between American and really forced English accents that really didn't sound like they were from anywhere.

1593,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I cannot believe they still make films like this. It reminded me of one of those disjointed Italian splatter films of the 70s. I felt really bad for the actors involved: Ben Kingsley, Billy Zane (of Titanic for goodness sake!), and the buff Kristanna Loken (awesome knockers), who never could quite decide if her character should have an accent or not. At some point these actors must have realized Bloodrayne was not going to be the next Underworld or LOTR, as you can detect hints of personal discontent in many scenes.

1596,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I was able to see an advanced screening of this movie. My friend and I are movie buffs and are rarely disappointed by movies like this. He, having been a huge fan of the video game was greatly disappointed by it. He said the movie was somewhat close to the story in the game, except for being set in a different time period and location, however the story line in the movie was completely lacking. It seemed that they tried to accommodate for this by putting a lot of unnecessary gore and nudity in it. Things seemed to be completely random. At one point it turned into a porno with a completely random sex scene which never had anything to do with the story. The fight scenes were terrible. The choreography wasn't impressive at all and because the camera flashed around so much it was extremely hard to see what was going on. Honestly, after this movie I think the director(Uwe Boll) shouldn't be doing anymore movies based on video games because so far he's done a horrible job. These movies have the potential to be awesome and he's turned them into complete crap. In my opinion, if you want to see a good vampire movie, wait for Underworld 2!"
1597,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"I actually saw this crap twice. I couldn't believe that it was as bad as I remembered after the first time, so I actually saw it again. I'm nearly gritting my teeth as I write this, because no, it wasn't as bad - it was worse.

I can usually enjoy even bad movies to some extent. I like B-movies. They're relaxing and most of them amusing. Bloodrayne, sadly, is neither. I found myself unconsciously trying to cover my eyes with my hand, feeling embarrassed and genuinely sorry for the cast and crew - with the exception, of course, of Uwe Boll himself, who obviously likes this...

I can't find a single redeeming feature in it. The story is ridiculous at best, and the costumes and wigs (oh, the wigs...) are made to match. The fight scenes are the worst I've seen (not kidding). We get to see vampire hunters Michael Madsen and Matthew Davis femininely tripping into battle like confused, overgrown ballerinas, and a number of identical chest wounds spray blood like lawn-sprinklers, while every single person involved - including the wounded - look like they just couldn't care less. I wanted to laugh, but just sat and stared in disbelief.

All in all, my advice is: Don't watch it. Go rent dear old ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" instead, because compared to this atrocity I'd give it the Academy Award. I myself will avoid the sequel(s) with fiery passion, and send the following prayer to any higher power: Please make any company considering giving Boll money for additional movies see reason!

Like one or more commentators before me, I only wish ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" were still around. They could have done this 4 times over without ever repeating themselves..."

1599,BloodRayne (2005),2.9,Uwe Boll,"The lead in this movie is a delicious redhead who does a wonderful sex scene that makes up for all of the cardboard acting. This movie is nothing to write home about however- if it catches you in the right mood it can be OK and watchable. If you find the lead as sexy as I did just watching her walk around is pretty cool, although it appeared she put on about 10 pounds by the end of the movie, when she changed costumes. She was still smokin hot throughout the entire film.

Downsides? There's plenty!- there is NO acting to speak of this movie- looks like everyone went to the George Lucas school of wooden line delivery in this one- ESPECIALLY the older leader of the vampire fighters- I couldn't decide what to spend more time being in shock of - his horrible wig that looked like a french poodle humping his head or his lines delivered as if he was on some heavy medication reading his lines from a teleprompter- seeing them for the first time in his life.

I already knew this movie sucked when I went to see it- but then I fell in love with the lead- she's so yummy she can make this dead dog limp home and the sex scene is worth the price of admission although it was WAY too short. Lots and lots of hardcore gratuitous sex with the lead of this movie could have made this movie a cult classic for generations.. too bad they didn't put that feature in here.. hahah.

Anyways if you watch this with the understanding that it will be like watching a good XENA episode you won't be let down very much and be able to enjoy yourself. This is not a professional quality theatrical release- it's more like a made for TV in a lot of areas.. except that sex scene.. woo hoo!

Here's hoping this actress finds some better roles for her fine ass.

PLOT: A half-vampire redheaded hottie is tracking down her vampire dad to kick his ass for killing her mother. Along the way she befriends some other vampire hunters and off we go on a mission of high body count vampire killing. Watching the lead is worth the price of admission cuz.. she's hot dude."
1600,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Johnathan Cross, a lover of extreme sports, is recruited to star in Rollerball. The players are on Rollerblades, trying to bring a heavy metal ball into a high goal. Also, there are motorcyclists around to bring momentum to the players. Oh yes, and there are no rules in the game. During his skyrocketing career, Johnathan has to experience what Alexi has found out: Blood brings more viewing pleasure to the audience. In a final game, Johnathan and his team have to fight for mere survival.

Back in 1975, James Caan brought us a brutal movie in which you can literally hear every bone in the players body break. Now, John McTieran has brought that film to us again, for a new generation. With stars like LL Cool J, Rebbeca Romijn and Chris Klein you would expect it to be a pretty bad remake, but this is not the case. Rollerball does the unthinkable and gives Psycho a running for it's money as the worst remake ever created by man.

Chris Klein in every film he has been in manages to make it look as if he has no range at all. His soft voice and good looks can only go so far, and in a movie where you need to beat the living hell out of another team member, you want someone that can at least yell and make a sound beyond a bird chirp. LL Cool J is only hear to bring the film a ""cool"" hip look, he's suppose to be the I don't give a damn, James Dean character, but it doesn't fly. Rebbeca Romijn, well, she has a nude scene, but when it's covered in the dark, you wonder why she is even in the movie to begin with.

Rollerball is suppose to be a bloody entertaining film, but McTeirnan at no point manages to show us anything entertaining. The entire game sequences seem uninspired and drawn out. When it goes for a shock, it misses and misses completely. I'm still wondering if LL Cool J's character is dead or alive, but apparently it's not important to the story. LL Cool J probably knew that this was going to be garbage and left the movie, leaving the film crew to make his character disappear. I don't blame him.

Not even the professional himself, Jean Reno save this film from the ultimate horrible experience that we all will endure from seeing this film. In a film about violence in sports, you would expect to see some, but when you have a PG-13 rating, you know that it was targeted to make money and nothing else.

I can't understand why someone would want to see this film, the final action sequence is yet another let-down in this horrible tripe. The only thing that this film has going for it, is it's 97 minute length, so if you do have the unfortunate experience of sitting through it, it will be over soon enough."
1601,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Original 'Rollerball' was a movie about dystopia future, where huge corporations ruled the world and there was no wars. But the blood lust of people had to be compensated, so there was this game called Rollerball, which was full of action, thrills and kills. But then one of the players was in the verge of becoming too big. He, Jonathe E. was a threat to the rule.

We can forget all about that with this remake of that 70's classic. There is no political metaphor, no philosophical questions about humanity, in fact there is no sense at all, if you don't count nonsense, about the movie. John McTiernan, director of such classics as 'The Predator' and 'Die Hard' has managed to make a movie, that is in one word, poor.

With some idiotic excuse the main protagonist Jonathan (at least the name is same), gets in the hazardous game of Rollerball with his pal Marcus (LL Cool J). Soon he notices, that there is something fishy about the game.

There isn't anything worthwhile to mention about the film. Tiernan directs like a man, who hasn't directed a single piece of film in his life. The plot is idiotic and the main baddies are pretty much camp material. The action is poorly choreographed and the editing tries so badly to be music video like, that it's flat out funny.

Can't really figure any reason for anyone to see this film.

Rating: 1 out of 10

Camp rating: 4 out of 10"
1602,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Rollerball is a bad movie that pretty much fails on every level. It's the year 2005 and the new sport of Rollerball is very popular. Marcus Ridley {LL Cool J} recruits his friend Jonathan Cross {Chris Klein} into the very dangerous sport which may not be that luxury as it seems. One of the games promoters will do anything to get higher ratings even if that means death. I have seen the original and after watching this I wonder why they took a very good film and just ruined it. Rollerball is a poorly written movie that lacks suspense and good action. The film is just really ridiculous at times that its hard to take serious. The dialog is really lame and the characters aren't very developed . The acting is terrible with the worst probably being Chris Klein who doesn't have enough charisma to be a lead. LL Cool J was alright but he just doesn't seem to be trying. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and Jean Reno both do a decent job but like LL Cool J, they just don't seem to really be trying. I can't blame them though as the writing is horrible and they are not given a lot of material to work with. The film is a lot more violent then the original, however, the action is still not very impressive. It also doesn't help matters that the studio got scared and went for the PG-13 rating and so the editing looks very bad. The film is about 95 minutes long but it drags on forever since its just a really boring film. The film is also confusing as some of the events that occur in the film don't really make a lot of sense. At some point during the film you will most likely stop caring. If you have seen the original then you will hate this movie. If you haven't seen it then you might like this but that's not very likely. Its just better to see the original. Rollerball is a loud and terrible film that's worth skipping and its also one of the worst films of 2002. Rating 2/10 avoid this film at all costs."
1603,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"After knocking off 26 positive reviews I felt the need to slaughter a cinematic turkey of mammoth proportions. And this it. This movie will depress anyone who loves movies. I would hate to encounter anyone who likes this piece of sewage. There is nothing of value on screen: from the horrid acting of LL Cool J to the gratuitous street luge scene. If the director had an ounce of humor he would have used The Trashmen's ""Surfin' Bird"" here. But that would be asking too much. Instead, the film makers get together and trash a classic. When this happens someone must step in and play policeman and arrest the Hollywood perpetrators involved in this criminal mischief. You have the right to remain silent. Anything--Well, forget it. I believe the director lost his mind. The night vision scenes were visual poison. Puke green. Fuzzy. Shockingly enough, an entire reel or two of this utterly useless footage of a chase of some kind made it into the movie. I have this feeling the film was unintentionally overexposed. The Rollerball game cannot be followed by anybody sober. Loud. Noisy. What are the rules? There is not a scintilla of drama anywhere in this motion picture. Take this stinker out to the curb before it contaminates the rest of your dvd collection or damages your player. Wretched. Shame on all who were involved. And a pox on their homes, too."
1604,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"I was really speechless after watching ""Rollerball"". I expected a dull movie, not something so dreadful. ""Rollerball"" has all the elements to make one of those bizarre cult classics from the 70's and 80's. Except the fun element.

The movie starts with the worst police chase in years. Believe me, any Lorenzo Lamas movie, even one featuring appearances from Dolph Lundgren, can be capable of a car chase better than this: we see Chris Klein running from police in a mix of skateboard and racing-car, in San Francisco. Then, helped by his friend LL Cool J., he goes to an Asiatic country. There, the most popular game is the Rollerball, a mix of basketball and roller-skating that seems to be deadly and a great money-maker. Rollerball is controlled by Jean Reno's character, the average ""mad-business-man"" stereotype. Then, we learn that Chris Klein is having an affair with his Rollerball partner, Rebbeca Romjin-Stamos.

What comes next is not worth telling. Of course, Chris, LL and Rebbeca will make a rebellion against Jean Reno. But there isn't anything new in this idea. It's wasted by a script that, once tries to make a cheap social critic, then tries to shove action sequences in the screen at all coasts, and both are really bad.

The acting is at the last level. It's incredible to see Jean Reno, an actor that is mostly great (watch ""Red Rivers"") making such a mess with his role. It's so stereotyped and has so less to do (despite it's importance in the plot) that you can completely forget about it. LL Cool J. is a special case: he keep going well for a while, and then completely disappears, showing that, maybe, good acting wasn't allowed in Rollerball rules.

Oh, the main couple. Chris Klein and Rebbeca Romjin-Stamos. Well, Rebbeca is incredibly sexy in this role, and it's nice to see her in topless scenes, so we can forget she's so bad here. And Klein. Let's just say Chris Klein will NEVER work in an action movie anymore. At least we hope so.

In the end, the movie is a complete mess. Is not only a waste of money, but also waste of time, celluloid and Jean Reno. That is a complete sin. It feels like director John McTiernan wanted so badly to make a stylish movie that he forgot to make a good movie."
1605,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"I suspected 2002 ""Rollerball"" was an ugly movie, but not that ugly! Well, let's get rid of the only merit of the movie: the presence of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, beautiful and tremendously sexy. Indeed, a statuesque female warrior is always sexy, all the more with that alluring scar on her face.

The tragic fact with ""Rollerball"" is that the story should be good, per se. The authors took the ideas from the original (and true) 1975 ""Rollerball"". They deleted the political and moral messages, which were somewhat a weakness of the 1975 film, and placed the story in some remote countries of a near future, allegedly ruled by violence, greed, abuse. But the way the film is made turns it into a disaster.

There is an over-long (and boring) preamble, with a race down-hill of some cretinous youngsters, in San Francisco. This is a great narrative mistake. The audience is anxious to know about the Rollerball game, and you excruciate them with idiots, easily found, alas!, in everyday life. In the next scene Jonathan (a remarkably blunt Chris Klein) has become the undisputed superstar of the Rollerball. We don't understand anything of the rules of the game. As a matter of fact, we don't understand anything of the plot! The guys on the screen keep talking about other guys, seemingly killed by the bad ones, or something like that. Who are who? The audience utterly ignores it. The next scene (say: someone escaping from somewhere) has no logical connection with the previous one. I bet that in the final editing of the movie a good 30 minutes were cut, making the story a complete mess. The only thing we get is that the villains deliberately provoke accidents on the field to raise the TV audience of the game. And then there is the lousy greenish nocturnal scene. Up to my knowledge, the worst visual idea in the history of cinema. Some 15 minutes of sufferings for the innocent viewer. The ending is even more ludicrous than expected.

But what is really incredible, even in a terrible movie, is that, in spite of the enormous technological improvements, the scenes of the game, and related special effects, are by far less spectacular, exciting, violent than those of the 1975 ""Rollerball"". The possibly interesting presence of women playing Rollerball is not exploited at all. The uniforms of the teams are worse than horrible, they are stupid.

There's nothing to save in ""Rollerball"". Just take Romijn-Stamos and bring her to another movie (keeping the scar on her face, if possible)."
1606,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"The original film was a masterpiece. Not only for the (at the time) over-the-top action, but for the marvelously clear look into the future. Only science-fiction would dare suggest the future holds society completely employed by six corporations! What a brilliant prophecy!

In the self-centered and hedonistic 70's, isn't it amazing the true gist of the original film is the attempt to keep a famous player from becoming bigger than the game he plays? One need only peruse today's business section to see how our society now strives to eliminate the notion of the individual in favor of an identity-nullifying ""team concept.""

So one can say the original is all about the triumph of the individual.

The 2002 version is nothing more than a haphazard mess that shows what happens when a studio changes hands and a cinematic vision is compromised for a PG-13 rating that effectively destroys the film. Rollerball could do with a well-intentioned remake; this wasn't it.................by a long shot."

1608,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Never in my life have I seen something held together by cameo appearances... I mean, this has to be the most commercialized, corporate movie I have ever seen.

From the god awful Slipknot's appearance to the Ben Affleck of the next generation Chris Klein, the only uplifting experience was Jean Reno, because he is the coolest actor since Samuel L. Jackson.

And seriously, for a movie made just four years before its set-time, it went way overboard.

Oh and a fun fact: ECW and WWE's Paul Heyman is that annoying commentator you see from scene 1... and generally in each and every scene afterwards.

From wrestling (Heyman), fake metal (Slipknot) to horrible acting (Klein) and a poor storyline that can truly only be outdone by Gigli, I find myself wanting to rip out my left kidney if not for the fact I already did so watching Gigli."
1609,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"`Rollerball' is a god-awful remake of the 1975 Norman Jewison film about a fictional sport in which murdering the players becomes a primary object of the game. The original film acquired what little credibility it had by setting the story sometime in the distant future. This version is set in the present, but it tries to maintain its believability by locating the league in Southwest Asia, under the parochial assumption, I suppose, that that part of the world is every bit as alien, exotic and dehumanized as any hypothetical future society. It doesn't work. It is simply impossible for us to believe even for a split second that the owners and promoters of this sport would think they could get away with such murderous shenanigans broadcast live to millions of viewers the world over. Might not the United Nations, among other international organizations, have a thing or two to say about all this? Also, will someone please explain to me just WHAT purpose is served by having the promoters of this sport killing off their own players? Doesn't that sort of deplete their own resources for future games? I can't imagine too many people willingly signing on to engage in this sort of gladiatorial tomfoolery.

Even if we agreed to swallow the whole thing merely for the sake of the entertainment value of the film, we would be forced to admit that `Rollerball' is a chintzy, clunky, uninteresting movie in all respects. The sport itself  sort of a cross between motor cross racing, roller derby, hockey and basketball  is completely unexciting, consisting of little more than blurred figures racing madly around a cramped, claustrophobic track. Without even the context of good action sequences, `Rollerball' is forced to fall back on its dialogue and characters, which proves to be disastrous for all concerned. Chris Klein, in the role of hotshot Jonathon Cross - played by James Caan in the original - comes across as a minor league version of Keanu Reeves. LL Cool J is wasted in the part of Jonathon's American sidekick, and poor Jean Reno gets to play one of the most laughable villains we've run across in a movie in a long long long long time.

In fact, this redux turns out to be good for nothing BUT a few hearty laughs. If you are in need of such, check out `Rollerball.' It's a real hoot."
1610,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"A good friend of mine, and fellow rabid film fan, said he would give me a tenner (£10) if I honestly felt that Rollerball was worth a score higher than 1/10; as much as I need the cash, I just can't bring myself to lie. Rollerball is absolutely dire and truly deserves the lowest rating possible.

A muddled, unexciting piece of drivel from the word go, John McTiernan's lousy remake of Norman Jewison's 70s cult favourite is every inch as bad as you have probably heard. Perpetually-perplexed-looking Chris Klein is unwisely cast as Jonathan (portrayed by James Caan in the original), a thrill junkie who is convinced by good friend Marcus Ridley (LL Cool J) to try his hand at Rollerball, a dangerous team sport played in Russia and its neighbouring countries.

The evil men controlling the sport, led by Alexis Petrovich (Jean Reno), are corrupt gangsters who will trade players lives in order to boost their ratings. But a brave American citizen like Jonathan isn't about to kowtow to the demands of nasty foreigners, and sets about upsetting the applecart.

To be honest, there are so many reasons to despise this movie, I really do not know where to start. I guess as good a place as any would be with director McTiernan, who seems to have lost all ability to make a decent film. This is the man who redefined the action movie in the 80s with Die Hard. He also proved he could do a decent remake with The Thomas Crown Affair. So what the hell happened here?

His Rollerball is unexciting, glossy toss that makes the mistake of pandering to the teen crowd. As a result, we get a pretty boy lead 'actor' (Klein makes Keanu Reeves look like Olivier), a rapper playing support, an ex-model (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) as the love interest, and even an inexplicable appearance by noise-merchants Slipknot. The script treats the viewer with contempt, making no attempt to explain the titular game, rendering the action scenes meaningless. If we have no idea of the rules of the sport, how the hell can we get excited about it?

Visually the film is even worse: the 'roller dome'the arena in which Jonathan is king (despite constantly looking as if he is about to wet himself)resembles a kids activity area rather than a tough battlefield; the players, dressed in shiny PVC, look like they're off to an S&M party; and for some reason an entire chase scene is shot viewed though some kind of night-vision goggles.

The acting ranges from poor (Reno, Romijn-Stamos) to very poor (Klein, rapidly becoming my most hated actor, and LL Cool J).

Gone is the bone-crunching realistic violence of the original film; in McTiernan's version of the sport, it seems that no-one is supposed to get hurtif they do get injured, it's because of their unscrupulous bosses and their money-grabbing ways. Gone is the futuristic settingthis one is supposed to be in the here and now! And gone is any respect I had for JohnMcTiernan."

Anyway back to this utter **** up remake. McTiernan you ought to be thoroughly ashamed to even call this film 'Rollerball'. Was the editor being fxxxed up the arse sideways while he pressed the buttons?? $70,000,000 budget on what - plastic surgery for the acting line-up and foie gras sandwiches?

What in hell's name was the film about? It was disjointed and impossible to follow. Dialogue - forget it. The characters barely developed during the whole film and you couldn't care if they got bludgeoned to death during the game anyway.

1613,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"A certain film critic -- I believe it was the NY Times reviewer -- labeled ""Battlefield Earth"" as, to paraphrase, ""what will become known in infamy as the worst film of the 21st century."" He was wrong. ""Rollerball"" wins hands down. The acting, dialogue and direction are incomparably bad -- and I defy anyone to sit down after watching the movie once and effectively explain the plots, character motivations, or any of the rules of the Rollerball game. This is the most poorly-edited major studio film I've seen since ""Superman IV,"" which is still my least favorite movie of all time. There are at least five or six very, very obvious dubs over the f-word, clearly done late in the game to obtain a PG-13 rating. This is fine for an airing on network television, but for an R-rated DVD? Um, no. Others here have already eviscerated the ridiculous night-vision sentence effectively, so I won't go there.

This completely lame remake misfires on every level . Since it's set a couple of years in the future there's no chance it can be called futuristic . It might be described as "" Dark "" but that's because no one seems to have paid the electricity bill during production . But the main failing in this version is the game of Rollerball itself . In the original the game would see matches where several team members would either die or be maimed for life but in this present day version it doesn't seem anymore dangerous than American football or Rugby or any other type of contact sport . hell even bimbos are allowed to take part . in other words this is a game for wimps in comparison and this ruins the movie far more than the oft quoted aspects like the poor acting , camp sound effects and the night vision sequen"
1615,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"In the original film, the game attempted to stand as an outlet of Corporation superiority; constantly demonstrating to the consumers (the people) that individuality is futile. Apparently, one does not have to either read the screenplay or physically watch the original film for there to be a remake. Decent director John McTiernan, who ""wow-ed"" me with such films as the remake of The Thomas Crown Affair as well as his early cult hits like Die Hard and Predator has obviously lost his ability to either A) do remakes or B) handle a camera with any sense of decency. If I was allowed one question to have answered through the course of my life, my question would be, ""What was the point of Rollerball the remake?"", and I do believe there would be answer from any higher authority. This film single handedly goes down in the record books as not just the worst remake to come out of Hollywood, but it is also a double threat, with it being in the top 100 of worst films ever conceived. It is embarrassing to say, but it has to be said, that Rollerball is one of a few select films that demonstrated no ability in the fields of direction, acting, cinematography, or writing. Nothing, I repeat, nothing of value can be found with this film, and I even tried hard, but one must easily look at this film and simply state, ""It failed"".

There was absolutely nothing science fiction about this film outside of the possibility of the actual Rollerball game being a rather sci-fi-esquire type game, but when you look at it, there is nothing special about the sport. The 1975 film version was extremely science fiction with its views on the future of our world, the surrounding environment, as well as subtly placed usage of the laser gun. Yet somehow, this 2002 version is able to call itself a ""science fiction"" merely on the premise that it takes place three years in the future. Three. Whole. Years. That to me is the staple of why this film corrupted from the inside out. The writing was atrocious to say the least. It felt as if the writers of this film, one Larry Ferguson or one John Pogue (odd, this horrid smelling filth of a film took two of Hollywood's scribes  ouchers!), took random ideas, threw them together and attempted to create continuity in the course of 97 minutes. No doubtably procrastination was an issue, and to cut corners to meet a deadline these avid writers chose to cut characters, huge plot points, and any sort of solid stream of consciousness to create possibly the worst that Hollywood could ever offer. Nothing, in the form of script, plot, or action/adventure is worth mentioning in this film. Words came out of the actor's mouths, but they meant nothing, they stood for nothing, and half the time it just had me laughing due to the staged words that they were dealt. Again, there was no value in this film.

Chris Klein has ridden the shirt tales of American Pie for a very long time (I always saw him as the Weakest Link of those films), so he decided to take a leading man's role in Rollerball in hopes that he could transform his career into a leading man, but you can't make cardboard stand on his own. Could Chris have attempted to grow a backbone for this film  is that possible? The words that came out of his mouth had no emotion; he was together with Rebecca Romijn-Stamos for purely the physical admiration, and someone needs to tell him that by squinting his eyes harder doesn't indicate that he is upset or angry. I cannot seem to shake the image of him riding with L.L. Cool J in the Russian night on a motorcycle using ""night vision"" for dramatic purposes, and Klein speaking unattached words out of my mind. It was hilarity on a grand scale. I remember the pair talking about something, but the laughter coming from my mouth was far more overpowering. Nothing (which seems to be the common theme of this film) is of value in this film. That isn't to say that those like LL, Jean Reno, Stamos, or even my favorite Naveen Andrews were any better. Klein led the pact with kindergarten acting skills, but Reno was completely over the top, which caused confusion as to who he was and why he was involved financially, Andrews was nothing more than filler, Stamos was used for the nudity  that was all, and LL kept the ""hip-ness"" factor on a grander scale. Nobody demonstrated anything close to talent in this film and it ultimately boils down to the failure of decent director John McTiernan.

Rollerball is one of those films that gives remakes a horrid name. Even if the original wasn't worth writing home to mother about, films of this stature only place a black scar on the future of remakes. I have to be worried about McTiernan because of my enjoyment of some of his past films and how anyone could see the final cut of this film and say, ""This is my best work yet!"" If you cannot say those words as you hand the final reel to the distribution company, I would reconsider the release. Writing was far worse that imaginable, the acting was nowhere to be seen, and the cinematography (something I didn't feel like going into too deeply with this review) felt as if it was done by those who are afraid of camera. Honestly, I have seen better amateur work than what Rollerball had to offer. Why is this film still being distributed? My only wish is that future directors and actors actually take pride in their work instead of just allowing the paycheck to do the talking. Ignore this film or it will haunt you the rest of your life!

1617,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"I wasn't expecting much. In fact the poorest of poor reviews that this film received had made me curious enough to watch this it (for free on cable I might add). Firstly I should say that I am not a huge fan of the original movie, it is a reasonable action film, so my dislike does not stem from a loyalty to the first incarnation of this story. My dislike for the 2002 Rollerball comes from a feeling of being patronized by everyone involved in the making of this movie. How did the producers ever think that this was acceptable on any level?

The acting is second rate but what is to be expected from one of the worst casts ever assembled? Klein is worthless unless he is making a joke of his own persona (Election), LLcoolJ is one of a string of rappers that should never be given a 'tough guy' role simply because of his real profession and Reno, the one talented actor among them, seems to slip into pantomime dame territory. I will give Paul Heyman praise for his character as the English announcer, he seems to come across as a decent and fairly charasmatic actor but he does little that he doesn't do brilliantly in his day job.

The attempted satire relating to the commercialisation of sport and its reliance on violence is pathetically toothless. The direction is simply a mess. The attempt to make this non-sensical sport look breathtaking through rapid editing and instant replay is awful. It does nothing but make you realize that restrained directing and editing are a wonderful thing.

Rollerball represents everything that is wrong with mainstream Hollywood movies. It shows a lack the of originality, does this version add anything to the original version?, that has dogged film for years. I cannot believe that there are so few new ideas that we have to see cult action movies, cult British crime movies and television shows remade over and over again. This movie should be avoided at all costs."
1618,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Dreadful. At least three times during the movie, I contemplated turning the TV off but resisted, feeling I should at least finish what I'd started.

There is NO character development--not that any of the characters (less two) were ever formally introduced. I barely knew who was who in this movie. There was also very little plot development, for that matter. To make it worse, this has probably got to be one of the most incoherent movies I've ever seen! I gave up trying to figure out what was going on and why. The story went here, there, and everywhere, without really explaining what was happening, and with very little dialogue. Much of what was done and said made very little sense. Did I mention the camera work was poor? Is it any wonder that I kept staring at the clock, keeping track of how much longer I had to endure?

But don't take my word for it. If you've got a couple hours to kill, watch it and wonder for yourselves why this movie ever made it to theatres."

... and a ten minute sequence filmed with a NightVision filter? It could have worked if it had been filmed in first-person, but the angles make it illogical at best. It's like The Fast and the Furious had a kid with Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome... and it had a severe mental disability.

1628,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"After watching this(well, watching... occasionally glancing at it, which, unsurprisingly, was more than enough to pick up the plot), I have to wonder about its placing as #50 on the bottom 100 list... personally, I'd have rated it much higher. It's one of the worst films ever made, without a doubt. The plot is some muddled mess about the future in which some insane sport is run, and someone finds out about there being some cheating going on in it... I don't know, I think the biggest problem was that I really didn't give a damn. Some new sport is started, and it's worse than the rest... so? Don't participate in the bloody thing. Some people start cheating in order to win or make it more interesting or whatever... so? Isn't that what all sports are about? To the best of my knowledge, there hasn't been a completely honest type of sports that was completely devoid of cheaters since... well, ever. That's what we do, us humans. We challenge each other to find someone who's better at one particular thing and cheat if we don't think we can win. What else is new? In case you haven't figured it out by yourself yet, no, I don't care for sports. The pacing is awful and tries the viewers patience, whilst the editing does its best to supply him/her with a sturdy migraine, usually successful. The editing, score and dialog clearly does what it can to seem 'hip', cool and fresh, mostly just resulting in more bodily pain(now it's not just your brain that hurts due to it trying hard to understand the pure crap the plot and the film in general is, now your ears will be bleeding from the noise and your eyes will be flinching from the quick, pointless cuts that try far too hard to be stylish). McTiernan, one question. What the hell is wrong with you? OK, maybe you were never *that* talented... but Last Action Hero was at the very least solid and Die Hard was good. How did you slide so low down the talent ladder? One of the steps broke and you didn't grab a hold of it, is that it? The acting is dire. Not that it's any surprise, really... come on, admit it, LL Cool J can't act, we all know it; and apparently, neither can Chris Klein, if his performance in this mess is anything to go by(guess he just got lucky in the American Pie films). The characters are poorly written clichés that we don't care even the slightest bit about. The whole film is an unforgivable mess of a somewhat decent idea with absolutely no redeeming qualities. See the first version or just skip this one altogether. I recommend this to mindless sports fans or teenagers who like loud noises and break-neck speed editing. 1/10"
1629,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Norman Jewison's 1975 film 'Rollerball' is not a perfect film, it did have pacing issues, had heavy-handed moments and James Caan and John Houseman's characters were the only interestingly developed ones. The rollerball sequences however are truly exciting and harrowing, it's thought-provoking and relevant, it's well made and acted it has a powerful ending and it has some of the best use of classical music in film.

Whatever faults the original had, it's a masterpiece compared to this dreadful mess, which makes all the few faults of the original, magnifies them by a thousand and makes a plethora's worth of flaws on top. The remake of 'Rollerball' not only fails spectacularly as a remake, down there as the worst and most pointless ones out there along with 'Psycho', 'The Wicker Man' and 'Stepford Wives', but is catastrophically bad film in its own right. It is truly hard to believe that it was directed by the same man responsible for great films like 'The Hunt for Red October', 'Predator' and especially 'Die Hard'. One of the biggest falls in film quality ever and John McTiernan's worst film by a significant degree.

Not even the usually game and more Jean Reno is enough to save it, but actually comes off the least badly. The acting is very poor, and this is at best, especially from a chronically wooden and personality deprived Chris Klein, in a role that even the best of actors working today would struggle to do anything with, and Rebecca Romijin-Stamos who doesn't even try to act. Character development may not have been a strong suit in the 1975 film, but at least the two lead characters were interesting. Here there were no interesting characters at all, all of them severely underwritten ciphers.

McTiernan's direction has no style, personality, tension or energy of any kind, it's uncharacteristically incompetent career-worst and career-killing worthy direction and 'Rollerball' is a strong contender for the worst-directed film of that year. Don't expect good visuals either, 'Rollerball' is cheap, chaotic, too darkly lit and is to me has some of the worst editing for any film not to have SyFy or The Asylum's involvement. Eric Serra's, regular composer for Luc Besson's films, music score is never dynamic, in fact it's discordant and intrusive, and has nothing memorable about it.

School sports days are more exciting and suspenseful than the action here, and considering they and bullying were the lowest points of my school life that is not a compliment. No sense of danger, no tension, too darkly lit, chaotically edited and sometimes incoherent as well as too clean and glossy for something actually intended to be very dangerous (when it did try to be more violent it was gratuitously so), a huge problem for a film where it features heavily at the expense of everything else. The ending is as wet as a drip and floppy as badly out of date cabbage.

Dialogue is truly risible and should never have approved beyond first draft, and even earlier than that, the pace is so pedestrian the slowest snail moves faster in comparison and the story is redundant in all senses with no thrills or fun, lack of coherence is also an issue as is the jumbled structure.

Altogether, a catastrophically bad mess with no redeeming values (not even Reno). In the top 10 of the worst and most pointless remakes ever and on its own terms as a film it's not much better, even worse actually. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

Director misses the point all the time. Here, an accent should be on a metaphor for totalitarian society, benumbed with all the luxuries of the world, convinced that each individualistic attempt is doomed from the start. Here we have a different case - a metaphor, a pure object, a motive became a story itself. With none of 1960's, 1970's, politically awake attitudes, everything became cheap fun or even cheaper boredom.

1646,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"(Contains spoiler for the original Rollerball)

There are two themes running through the original Rollerball - the futility of man against the corporation, and the mesmerizing action of the game itself. Somehow John McTiernan takes both of these themes and totally butchers them into something that does not remotely do justice to the original, or to anything else for that matter.

The premise of 'accidents' being staged to pump up international ratings (on what medium?), and concurrent gambling on games, instantaneously, is stretching credibility. Having co-ed teams is almost believable but those stupid masks that the players all wear? And placing it all in Central Asia is bizarre.

The game itself has been changed from the original circular 1/8 mile track into a nightmare collection of props that only an X-Games inline skater could love. A demolition derby-style course, with jumping ramps where the paths cross, would already make for a hazardous game IMO. Motorcycles dragging players off the steeply banked turns and up onto the clear viewing panels? Guess it had to be Central Asia since this would never fly in the US with OSHA around. Staging accidents in this version simply wouldn't be necessary.

The parallels to the original with the rules changes to the game (not that there was much in the rules brought out in the plot) is the product of a premise by the director without the slightest idea of how to advance a story. There just isn't any there there, to paraphrase Gertrude Stein.

Watch the original, and especially the final scenes, with the silent crowd, the dead players on the track, the game reduced to Jonathon E stumbling around the track to score the only, meaningless goal, that is film-making. The amateurish ending of this namesake says 'so what?'

It is a sad waste of a tremendous idea."
1647,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Rollerball was a classic film from 1975 that has its fair share of good and bad reviews, but what set it apart was its social commentary, which showed a dystopian future where corporations take over everything, with one trying to get the main hero killed because his refusal to retire threatens the purpose of the sport according to one businessman. This remake basically removes it because the director thought it would be boring, changed the setting to present day, and focused more on action, which ends up being its main flaw. Not even Paul Heyman as one of the announcers and cameos from Shane McMahon and the band Slipknot can save this mess. The only reason I give this two stars is for the soundtrack (with awesome bands like P.O.D. and Godsmack), but the acting is bad, the action is too much the focus, and you know it's bad when the director of this garbage remake is sent to prison for a year for making false statements to FBI investigators about his role in the Anthony Pellicano wiretapping scandal (where he hired the detective to wiretap the producer due to disagreements), and this remake is one to avoid in favor of the original."

1649,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"The reputation of this film really goes before it. It was of course a remake of the 1975 original and it almost goes without saying that it is also vastly inferior. Most remakes are worse of course but this one really misses the mark quite spectacularly. What is so surprising is that it's the action scenes themselves that are possibly the most poorly executed. Director John McTiernan had been most famous for making classics of the action genre in Predator (1987) and Die Hard (1988), which makes it so doubly surprising that his action scenes in Rollerball are so poor. The game of Rollerball itself should be pretty simple but in this movie it can barely be followed nor understood. For the remake the arena has pointlessly being changed into a figure of eight shaped track that looks less like a place of futuristic violent sports combat and more like the set from the 90's game-show Gladiators. The action is fast, furious, yet incomprehensible, edited together in ways that do not help us know what the hell is going on.

The story-line underpinning events is broadly similar to the original but with poor performances and a weak script. You never get very involved with the plight of the characters and it's quite difficult believing that this is the number one sport in the world of the future. Unlike the original, the events only occur two or three years in the future, meaning that the dystopian sci-fi of the original is lost and we have a drearier contemporary world in which events unfold. Although it was quite an unusual idea setting the action in Kazakhstan of all places! To be fair to the film, it does move at a decent pace and is entertaining enough if you lower your expectations accordingly. If it wasn't a remake of a cult classic I daresay it would have passed under the radar as a ropey action movie but seeing as it is a new version of an old film and one with quite a considerable budget its flaws become all too apparent."
1650,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"This is actually one of the best five Hollywood movies from 2002. The film Verhoeven always dreamed of making. Only superfluous thing about it: remnants of plot and morality. The rest is speed and noise, sex and violence. Great stuff, rea"
1651,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"MAN THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME. It's the perfect badly-put-together movie that makes little/no sense and is basically a black eye on all other film directors. It insults the intelligence of the average viewer - things like plot, character development, and music are all eschewed in favor of MORE AND MORE ACTION AND SOME BREASTS. Moreover, the action is presented in incomprehensible cutscenes. You could take the entire movie reel, chop it up, throw all the pieces in a hat and then pick them out at random and splice them together and it would make just as much sense. Heck, it might even be better.

And the best part is that this movie is about this sport called Rollerball. The movie spends exactly 10 seconds explaining how the game is played and nobody I've talked to really understood it. It involves some bladin', some jumpin' and some punchin' and that's all that McTiernan thought you needed to know. Oh, and there are motorcycles that zoom around for some unexplained reason.

This movie is worth owning if you're a lover of bad cinema, but beware if you live in close quarters with other people - it's bad enough that they'll likely become physically violent if you watch it in their presence."

1653,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"I remember watching this dreck its opening weekend in the theaters. I was practically writhing in my seat, but about halfway through, I had an epiphany. It struck me very strongly and very clearly, and I had to test it. So, when the movie ended, and went and rented INSPECTOR GADGET, that insipid 1998 Disney comedy that was my formerly least favorite movie. I popped it in my VCR at home, and sure enough, I was right: after watching ROLLERBALL, movies that used to seem bad to me were suddenly tolerable. To further test myself, I put in my favorite film of all time, PULP FICTION. No cinema-going experience in my life has ever matched that viewing of PULP FICTION. It was alive and beautiful. I had tears in my eyes.

I used to condemn ROLLERBALL as a pointless movie, but now I see that this film serves a very real purpose. It's like that poor, fat, ugly guy you pass on the street. When you see him, you feel bad for him, but better about yourself. You say, ""I may not be perfect, but I least I don't look like THAT guy."" Hence, ROLLERBALL. So, if you've recently watched a bad movie and are feeling down, I suggest giving ROLLERBALL a rent, then rewatching that first film. You may be surprised."

1655,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Despite the title I do NOT want to compare this movie to Ridley Scott's masterpiece but it certainly is not as bad as some reviewers say it is... in fact I found this movie to be higly entertaining. There are no 'great' actors except for Jean Reno (who is not as good as he usually is though) but the typecasting is perfect except for Chris Klein who looks way too 'nice' but who is doing a very good job nevertheless... I don't know why he looks and sounds almost exactly like Keanu Reeves though.

At times the movie looks like you're watching a video clip but I guess that's just the sign of the times... The actionscenes in and out of the stadium are very exciting and never dull. There is some background information on how everything came to be but you have to pay attention or you miss it.

I also loved the references to the world of professional wrestling.

I give this movie a 7.5, it's not a 'great' movie but if you are willing to be entertained you'll be entertained by it..."
1656,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Having not seen the original ROLLERBALL, there's nothing to compare to. As a stand-alone film, it's very enjoyable. It's been a while since John McTiernan has directed a film. His last ones were the remade THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR and 13th WARRIOR. Here, it's thought that John has returned to what he does best, and it was nice to see a film that was surprisingly good. At first glance ROLLERBALL looks like it's going for the ""MATRIX effects"" that so many movies, shows, and commercials have been using too much, but John has stuck to his own methods of film making, and hasn't ""sold out."" Every action scene was not filmed in any over- outlandish style, and that was a star swinging high point. Chris Klien seems more accustomed to comedy, but here, he's starting to learn the ropes as a man of action. Though his youth is apparent within his role, he makes it through as a hero. LL Cool J has proven himself to be a compotent actor long ago, and he still has his own brand of charisma. Rebecca Romjin-Stamos also commands the screen as a tough Rollerball player who happens to have a romantic relationship with Klien's character. Another nice touch was the international casting and locations through the whole film. It gave a great mix. Especially with the great Jean Reno as the villain who always does good in the movies he's in. The rest of the villains are also great. They're cruel and it's a relief when they get what they deserve. For a PG-13 rated film, it was surprisingly violent. It's hard to believe that the theatrical version was edited from the original which supposedly has more violence.

But if the MPAA is getting lax, so what? One less movie getting too much hasslement. The action is brutal and pounding. When one concentrates fully on the film, it's like actually being in the arena with all the fierce action going on all around. When someone gets struck, it's felt by the viewer. But the standout action scene is a chase through darkness where it's totally pitch black and scene through nightvision lenses. This was a great method, because the atmosphere would be ruined by Hollywood lighting effects. This added on to wondering if Chris Klien and LL Cool J are gonna get away from the bas guys. The small roles were also cool. Like seeing WWE's Vince's son, Shane McMahon for one full second. (Blink and he'll be gone.) And surprisingly, former wrestling commentator Paul Heyman had a bigger role that thought, and has some funny lines. All in all, this is John McTiernan's best film in a long time. ROLLERBALL is not something that should be thought too hard about, but should be taken with consideration and excitement.

1657,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"I saw this film at an exclusive showing for competition winners courtesy of a local radio station. I really went because it was at the cool Sony cinema in Golden Square and it only seats about 60 people. The cinema was great but the movie sucked big time.

The original Rollerball was not too much a good film in the first place so the idea to re-make it had to be questioned. What on earth was John McTiernan on when he made this film? It was like a pop-video made up of the out-takes from Starlight Express. It was so bad. The acting was non-existent (Chris Klein is Keanu Reeves doppelganger), the script - someone is still looking for it! The first 40 minutes of the film were completely without narrative. I was utterly confused by what was going on. The remaining 50 minutes were part escape part revenge plot wise - I think? Oh! and it was so really loud that you could not think (I think that is what the movie-makers wanted). You'd have to be mentally deficient to even try and gleam any redeeming features from this film (Even if Rebecca Romijn does run around with her breasts hanging out)!

I saw this film for free and thought it was a waste of my time (at least I got some free drinks before the film).

Don't waste your money and time to pay and go and see this tripe. It will be appearing on Channel 5 (A low brow TV channel in the UK) as one of their Tuesday night movies.

Viewers will become more increasingly aware of its brilliant concepts and flawless acting, Chris Klein truly deserved numerous nominations for his top shelf delivery of the acting craft.

I don't feel like i need to persuade you to see this film, just look at the cast list: Naveen Andrews, LL Cool J, Pink, Chris Klein, Jean Reno and finally the legend that is Alice Poon. Also it isn't unfair to say that Jean Reno delivers such a performance it rivals his own performance in Leon

1660,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Fanboys, enough already! Its a really good action flick...

This is where the fan boys get stuck at, ""oh no! not a remake of my favorite movie of all time!"". Does that mean the ""favorite of all time"" always makes the remake the ""worse of all time"", i say no, not at all. So don't be fooled by all the negative comments by those fan boys, because it doesn't give justice to this very well done, fast pace action pack movie.

OK, i have to admit i'm a fan of the original and thats what attracted me to see this movie. Although at first i was a bit shocked by the flagrant differences with the original, i've then decided to let that fact go and just let the movie drive me, and you know what, it did his job, which is to entertain me.

Yes, the plot, if we can called it that, is somewhat nonexistent, and the script doesn't deliver any memorable moments, because it was intended that way, its typical with all action flicks. I was happy i give this movie a chance with an open mind(keep in mind its an action flick though). Considering all the facts, my final note: 6.5

In conclusion, i hope you'll give this movie a chance, just forget about the original, watch it purely for the action and you won't regret it."

1664,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"The ""Rollerball"" movie from 1975 was brilliant because although the film was violent, it was much deeper had a lot to say about humanity--our love of violence and how easily we can be led and controlled with sports. The film was brilliant on so many levels. So, some brilliant persons thought it was a great idea to update the film...make a new version which removed all the wonderful social commentary and left us with violence and not much more. Is it any wonder that the film is currently rated #39 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List? After all, folks who loved the original were sure to be angry when offered a slick but neutered version of the classic.

Early into the film, I could see why many viewers disliked this remake. The game was totally changed. Instead of the relatively simple roller derby-style game, this one includes ramps, tunnels and explosions. But the part that got me was how confusing the new game was...and the announcer even said that the game was too complicated to explain!! Didn't this make the filmmakers the least bit concerned?! In addition, the film featured all sorts of eccentric players--with court jester hats, dragon masks and more. Now remember...the original film was AGAINST folks in the game standing out and being unique! To top it off, Jean Reno's character then is heard that he's happy that the integrity of the game has been maintained...unlike in other sports! Huh??

The bottom line is that if the original film had never been made, ""Rollerball"" (2002) would have still been seen as a poor film. But in light of how many people loved the original and well crafted it was, watching this film is sure to frustrate most viewers....especially since a remake didn't have to be terrible and mindless."

1675,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"I'm not sure I've ever seen a talented director faceplant as hard as John McTiernan does here. This goes beyond bad story choices, performances, and unfortunate effects. There's an amateurishness pervasive through this film that makes it feel like the first film of a film student given too much money rather than the tenth film in a career that includes The Hunt for Red October. This is an embarrassment. McTiernan should have removed his name from the movie and attributed it to Alan Smithee.

Reading a bit about the film afterwards, I found information that the original script of this remake was actually really well received. It was sometimes called superior to the script to the original Norman Jewison film. However, McTiernan didn't like the social commentary aspects of the script and completely rewrote it with an emphasis on action. Well, that was certainly a mistake. He most assuredly did get rid of the social commentary with any potency, but the fact remains that the shell of the movie that remains feels like it requires social commentary. It doesn't surprise me that McTiernan would be uninterested in social commentary considering his filmography. The only movie that came close was Medicine Man, and that was mostly a selection of a topic rather than a serious attempt at digging into a topical issue.

What was left is, well, awful. Starting with the action, the supposed raison-de-etre of the film, it's pretty much incomprehensible. I think the problem may have been the set itself. There's a rink of a sort where the titular sport is played. From afar it looks big, but when you start picking out the details you realize that there's shockingly little room for a camera rig to move, especially with the two small towers at the center. It's an extreme limitation on the ability of the cameraman to actually capture action, preventing him from pulling back to film the movement of the sport in any sort of exciting way. The sport itself is supposed to be some kind of hard hitting action slugfest, but that sort of thing is hard to film from far away and sell convincingly to the camera without actually hurting someone. So, in order to convince the audience that the hits are hard, you have to go in close to do some in camera trickery that makes it look like the hits are hard, and the set is really small and has a lot going on (about ten people on rollerblades with at least two motorcycles at one time). I imagine they thought the set was big enough until they actually got onto it with a camera. I can imagine the panic that must have set in as everyone realized that the reason this movie existed wasn't going to deliver well.

Usually, though, it's not just action scenes that drive movies, it's the drama as well. What about that? I mean, there are actors spouting dialogue that seems to have something to do with each successive scene. I guess. Jonathan Cross is a guy who races down hills in San Francisco in grungy outfits, gets picked up by his friend in a Porsche in the middle of a race, and told that he can make big money playing in the Rollerball league. Except that the movie makes a point later to say that nobodies make no money and only a couple of marquee names make money. So...how is this grungy guy racing down hills the marquee name? I mean, I guess there's someone filming him as he does it, but it's never shown that the handheld video that gets destroyed in the chase is making him a name in the world of extreme sports.

Anyway, we skip ahead a bunch of time and we're in the middle of the season, and the league has finally decided that it's going to jack its ratings up by causing bodily harm to its players...in a game that includes metal balls flying at dangerous speeds and motorcycles driving amidst people on rollerblades. I mean...I guess? That's supposed to be the moral quandary of the film, but the characters are all so thin, poorly written, and barely sentient that when they start making the connection, we're wondering why it took them so long to figure it out.

The absolute nadir of the film, though, is the green sequence. Rollerball, much like The 13th Warrior, had a disastrous test screening and went through massive reshoots, except that McTiernan actually helmed them this time. One of the scenes they had to reshoot completely was a nighttime chase through the Arabian desert on a motorcycle. They filmed it too dark originally, and then they screwed up the reshoots by not allocating enough money to do nightshoots right. So, they tinted everything green like it's night vision or a silent movie from the 1920s. It also looks like it was filmed on video instead of actual film. It looks really cheap, and, to make matters worse, there are random cartoon sound effects peppered throughout as though the sound editor had simply given up and was trying to screw with the production.

The plot resolves with violence and no one cares because it's all stupid. Hell, the very last moments of the film feel like the editor joined the sound guy in giving up and just stopped the movie.

I'll say it again, but Rollerball is an embarrassment. John McTiernan should feel bad for loosing this upon the world. It's flatly acted (except by Jean Reno as the owner who's just having a ball), flatly filmed (when it's not embarrassingly filmed), confusingly told (no except, it's always confusing), and rather painful to sit through.

1677,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Set in the near future (possibly the early 2000s lol), our film begins with Jonathan (Chris Klein) accepting a dangerous dare which leads to him being hunted by police within the city. While on the run from the police Jonathan bumps into an old friend who just happens to be in the right place at the right time. His friend Marcus (Played by LL Cool J) suggests now is the time to do something better in life and suggests Jonathan joins him by his side on the ""Rollerball ""team. Naturally with the police trying to hunt Jonathan down he decides to escape the city and run away from the police by accepting his friend's offer, becoming a professional player in ""Rollerball"". While participating in the world's most watched and dangerous game, Jonathan suspects foul play from the hierarchy above. He believes that someone is setting up players in his team to get injured, or, worse, die which would result in boosting both television ratings and larger bets from people among the crowd.

One of my biggest surprises while watching the start of this film was that there was no character setup (seriously none). From the get go all the introduction (Jonathan accepting a bet and suddenly bumping into his old friend at just the right time) is so far fetched and along with that, there is zero reason to care for any leading character because of the lack of setup. After the introduction, the film continues to ignore any element of character development and jumps straight into a round of Rollerball with our leading cast.

Let's talk about Rollerball as a game. There are two teams in which the players are all on rollerblades. A metal ball drops and the teams are required to collect the ball, go around a specific path and then dunk the ball into a goal. The arena for Rollerball is also filled with Rock N' Roll music and an audience making large bets. It's boring. While the film is able to explain the workings and rules of Rollerball, when it's actually game time in the movie... as a viewer it is truly impossible to follow. When a game of Rollerball is in motion the filming style is full of close ups. The Rollerball sequences in the film also go for a lengthy duration. When the viewer can't follow what's going on it's a painful experience to watch lengthy sequences and uninteresting. Not to mention the spoon-feeding of information by the commentators that's also over used here.

As a plot, it's incredibly thin, but it also takes a long time to get going. It takes at least 30 mins until any type of developed plot surfaces. The outcomes are predictable and the plot speaks down to its audience as if we will never guess who the bad guy is. Villains are also childish and silly.

To give the film some credit I actually liked the way Rollerball looks. The arena itself and some of the costume design work is probably the one and only major element I find enjoyable within this remake. Nudity in certain scenes is unnecessary and one scene in particular chooses to use a ""Night Vision effect"" which doesn't hold up on the Blu-ray.

Supporting actors such as Jean Reno & LL Cool J are incredibly way over the top and give a confident yet dissatisfying performance. Actress Rebecca Romijn is flat and serves no real purpose to the film other than to give our leading man a love interest and a purpose to fight on.

Overall, I'm shocked. Quite possibly one of the worst remakes I have ever seen in film history. With uninteresting characters and a thin (yet predictable) plot, Rollerball's excitement fizzles rather quickly. The game itself is hard to follow due to excessive close ups. And to think, this film was directed by John McTiernan. He's the man and legend who gave us the greatest Christmas film ever made: Die Hard (1988). In the end, we're all human and make mistakes in life. If you decide to watch this film you just made one of them.

1680,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"I'll always remember the time I went to see this movie. I went with a couple of friends figuring to see a normal, popcorn movie. Boy was I wrong. What sticks out in my mind is that when we went in the theater there were about two people in the theater beside us. I just figured that people had seen it already. Ha ha ha.

The movie starts out with a teenager doing some extreme street luge down the streets of LA. Because, of course, that is legal. He is approached by LLCool J to come into this new, cool, dangerous sport called Rollerball. Boiled down it is a hardcore rollerderby with a ball and a big dish. It is the most uninteresting ""sport"" you could think of. There he meets a woman and they fall in love. So, as his career flourishes, he dates her. As this goes on, the president of this sports league starts to bribe teams to get bloodier in their combat, being that there are no rules. Chris Penn sees this and, after fighting for their lives, he and a few people escape...and then the movie ends. There is no scheming of plotting, they just escape. There is no closure and it's not satisfying like in Pulp Fiction or something to that effect, it's just an end. Like they forgot to distribute the ending of the film.

This movie is easily the worst I have ever seen. The plot is virtually non-existent, the acting is bad, and the directing...wait THERE IS NONE. Don't waste your time with this crap. Final Grade: .5/10"
1681,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"I don't know whether Chris Klein can act or not, but he's not even trying here. He has absolutely no charisma or screen presence, and that's not a good thing considering he's the lead.

The movie is centered around a game you basically know nothing about, therefore you can never really understand what's going on in the Rollerball arena. That's not a good thing, considering that the game takes up half of the movie.

Rebecca Romijn looks like a vampire from some horror flick. That's not a good thing, considering she's beautiful and sexy without horrible wigs and scars.

The movie lacks jokes or funny moments, which is not a good thing considering that the plot is boring and makes little to no sense.

Okay, some of the 'gaming' scenes are rather fun to watch, but still confusing. And Rebecca Romijn is not that bad looking in it, either. But when a movie was voted for by 4000 people, and has no entries under ""memorable quotes"", well... It figures."

The writing and the cinematography are lazy. The movie's rife with massive plot holes and random confusing images. The characters mean nothing. In some instances, hilarious Hanna Barbera sound effects are used in lieu of foley. I'm serious. ""They're gaining on us! Punch it!"" Zoink! I was rolling in the aisles. Was the editor drunk? Maybe he was just a raving loon. The movie originally had much more cursing, not to mention boobs. But the studio wanted a PG-13. Unfortunately they had no money to reshoot, so they just dubbed over the curse words. It was like watching Die Hard on USA. ""I don't give (AN EGGPLANT) what you think, (BASKET WEAVER)!""

The only thing I can think of is that director John McTernian must have been very short of money when he made this monstrosity. Avoid at all possible costs.

1690,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"I don't think I've seen a remake this terrible. There have been quite a few bad ones (most of them infact) but this is by far the worst. They took the elements of the origional rollerball and rather then updating the special effects and cinematography and making the story more relevent to the world today (rather then the 70's) they choose to make it a showcase of everything that is bad with modern films.

The changes in the story from the origional were terrible, especially replacing the end with this considerably more tacky one. The special effects were highly poor, and the cinematography was a joke with little of the action being able to be made out. The film became a band wagon for any ""actor"" that wanted to boost their waining career and there were far too many attepts at being ""clever"" and ""arty"" that simply back fired and made the production into more of a joke. The idea to shoot a scene in night vision was just painful, and the final action sequence was so terrible (including a scene where a small stool is used to block the blast from a shotgun and ultimately defeat the big baddie) you just keep hoping the film will end quicker. It is impossible to care what happens to any of the characters in the film because they are so shallow and lifeless and the plot itself in it's entire depth could be summed up on the back of a relatively small stamp.

There is not much else that can be said, the user ratings speak for themselves and I'm not sure I've ever seen a film (with this many votes) with such a low weighted average rating. Really in most cases if someone says a film is bad and your tempted to watch it your best off making your own mind up, but with this, well, you can trust the (when I last checked) 1337 people that gave this film a ""1"" vote. It's also ranked, on last check, as IMDB's 39th worst movie of all time and only a handful of the films considered worse have more user votes then this (Battlefield Earth being the most notable, lol).

So really, just don't bother. If you haven't seen the origional cult classic, watch that instead, because that is a good film and this really isn't. You can follow the action in that, the characters draw you in and the ending is great. This film is a pale shadow of the 70's classic. If you have seen the origional, then trust me when I say you'll be even more disapointed with this remake."

1693,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Seems John McTiernan's ROLLERBALL is already generally accepted as one of the all-time turkeys, but I'd recommend it as a fun action movie that's not remotely as bad as it's usually made out to be. In fact, it's very good, and much better than Norman Jewison's pretentious original, which seemed to think it was an art house movie disguised as a sci-fi thriller, but which had neither the necessary panache nor the necessary brains.

The locations are fresh and atmospheric, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and LL Cool J look great and drip charisma, the cinematography (by Steve Mason) is first-rate, and McTiernan gives us his best action since the original DIE HARD, with a particularly stunning ""night vision"" chase across a desert involving trucks, bikes and a plane. The bonecrunching, bloody violence of the Rollerball games and the opening street luge race will also keep action fans on the edge of their seats.

Pretty dumb, but never boring, ROLLERBALL is one of those movies where you should make up your own mind rather than let your thoughts be dictated to you by majority opinion - you might be pleasantly surprised. It's too bad that the film - which bears strong evidence of heavy pre-release cutting, with missing scenes as well as trimmed nudity and violence - is almost certain never to be released in its full-length version.

Still, ROLLERBALL is a blast. See it."
1694,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"This was a poor remake of an ordinary movie. While the 70's flick had at least some grit and a semblance of social study, this remake is flaccid and lacks the biting irony its predecessor sometimes had. A show for teenagers in need of a quick crash-bang "

Instead of the game being worldwide, it is underground, and wars still exist. I turned it off half way into it, because it tried to be popular instead of thought-provo"
1696,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Gosh this film ends up being a mess. I can see what the director was attempting to achieve and there's some merit in his attempt  a remake of a very good 1975 film with updated politics. Unfortunately the updated politics are too shallow to take seriously.

One central trouble is there's too much frenetically paced action and not enough time spent on explaining the story or the society in which Rollerball is set. The original Rollerball by comparison is a very intelligent piece of speculative fiction which films its Rollerball' sequences expertly and a lot more cohesively than the updated version.

A specific annoyance for me was an extended scene shot at night which uses military night view technology. Suddenly the picture on my TV went monotone and grainy. I thought my trusty 1983 Sony was finally giving up the ghost. I smacked it's side repeatedly until I realised it wasn't my dear TV's fault, it was bloody Rollerballs!

Towards the end, the film becomes disgustingly violent. I was going to give Rollerball 4/10 but the ridiculously overt violence makes me subtract a point.

Despite my harsh words, I will say that I enjoyed Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (what a mouth full!) declading out of her robust costume to reveal two of the most formidable and juicy looking breasts I've ever seen. If only she had spent more screen time naked, I'd raise my score a couple of notches.

3/10"

1698,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Oh dear, once again a remake that hopes to rake in a few quid from a successful predecessor that does not quite work.

What a horrible film, the acting was horrible, the tension in the matches was non-existent and where was the blood and gore?!?!? Not to want to pick holes in this film *scoff* but the film is supposed to be based on an ultra violent cross of rollerblading and lacrosse, right? So where was all the violence and blood and gore, surely this film would have succeeded if Tarantino would have directed it. At least the premis of the film would not be misleading. OK, so there is some shooting and a few killings near the end, but really this film had so much more potential in it.

Klein although good as the sensitive Keanu Reeves clone from American Pie does not suit this role well, but he is not the main reason for hating this film, (he doesn't really help save it either). His range is constantly stuck between brooding and setting up to brood. Not a good characteristic if you're supposed to be an intense rollerball athlete really. Someone with more intensity or charisma would probably have made this film entertaining at least.

Poor L.L.Cool.J, I feel sorry for this guy, here is a man, who clearly wants to make the serious leap from rap star to movie star and you thought he actually had a chance after watching him in Deep Blue Sea, which has been very successful, and justly so, really good film that. But here's rollerball come to knock him back down, not good. Even though he tries to make the best out of a bad situation he is really given nothing to work with, playing second fiddle to Keanu, sorry Klien and not a good script.

What would have been good in this movie would have been if they had made a huge elaborate set with hard gritty violence that climaxed in a huge match which people really cared about the outcome, oh well."
1699,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"This was one of the last movies I ever saw in the theatre (my last trip was over a year ago) I paid $13 bucks to see this POS and have never forgiven myself for it. The first thing I couldn't stand was the fact that it took place in Eastern Europe. Just listening to all those bad accents makes the movie look like a cheap wannabe action flick. Plus, as every reviewer previous to me has pointer out, that STUPID night vision scene. Maybe would have been interesting for a minute, but not 15. I remember people walking out of the theatre at this point. After this disaster of a movie was over, everybody was saying to the people they came with ""what the hell was that?"". I admit that I will sit down and watch films others describe as camp or cheesy, but I think even if I was watching this on tape, I would have turned it off. There is something seriously flawed with this film. Many have pointed out that it is the editing and I am inclined to agree. So the bottom line is DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

1700,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Before you groan, let me just say (quickly) that there was a story here that I just don't think ever made it to screen (and I read the Ebert review after coming to this decision).

I was intrigued by the semi-civilization that existed in what turns out to be the ""New Europe"" (thank you, Rummy). There was a vague lawlessness that I would have really enjoyed learning more about ... people ""disappearing,"" the criminal economy, the lack of respect for human life on the part of the Reno character ... I wanted more details.

Sure, Chris Klein was completely miscast, the dialog stunk and even the game itself was convoluted, but there was untapped potential in the story.

As a wrestling fan, I got a kick out of seeing Paul Heyman as the American announcer. However, if Rollerball the sport had no North American cable deal, why did ""Rollerball"" the movie have an American play-by-play announ"
1701,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"No wonder this movie was such a box office bomb. They have a clean cut, moma's boy, Chris Klein, playing a tough, hardknocking, supposedly best Rollerball player in Europe. The lead actor was so miscast. And that is only the beginning of what is wrong with this movie. The start of the movie with the luge scenes in the streets of San Fran were awful and so unbelievable. If anyone did that, they wouldn't be alive for very long. Plus, in the end, Jonathan's friend, LL Cool J(Marcus), just happens to show up to give him a ride. It was so stupid because Jonathan is supposed to be this good hockey player hoping to make it in the NHL, but is risking death or permanent injury by rolling on a board dodging traffic.

Now, on to Europe. The game of Rollerball looked really boring to begin with. Then we have these actors with awful accents. And a lot of it was just stupid. Like Marcus apparently gets killed, but there is no conclusion to that chase scene. I guess Jonathan just gave up. We just don't know. And the ending was just silly. The players rebel and Jonathan actually kills the owners and stuff. I mean, afterwards he would be looking at life imprisionment in jail. He was certainly no hero or anyone the audience could like. And that is one of the big problems with this movie in the first place.

FINAL VERDICT: Weak acting, weak story, weak lead actor. Overall a very bad movie, so please don't watch this."
1702,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"The TagLine for ""RollerBall"" is ""Get in the Game"". All during this movie, I just wanted out. There are severaly apparent flaws with this film, all of which will be discussed further on.

ROLLERBALL, the sport of the near future. It takes place in a ring that looks like a giant 8, with two sky tracks on them. One team must maintian possesion of the Rollerball for two trips around the track before jumping off of a ramp in the middle of the Arena, and throwing the ball into a big golden bowl ""score"".

The Arena in a big bowl in figure eight fashion, as told above. The offense on a team are mounted on RollerBlades, while the Team defense has motorcycles. They zoom around the arena, knocking each other out and scoring for a specified period of time. The team with the most points wins.

This sounds cool, right? Well, it is infinitley cooler in writing then it is on the big screen.

Chris Klien plays the role of Jonathon Cross, a rookie at the sport that the masses just love to shower with affection. I don't see why, but they do. He comes from AMERICA and to the Russians he plays for, he seems to be a miracle boy.

Jonathon Cross is supposed to be the hero, but to me, he just comes off as a big slow guy. There was no reason for me to like him, except that I am told he is good at the sport, and that I should love him.

LL Cool J plays Marcus Ridley, the man who gets Klien into the sport. LL goes through the role with typical LL ease that we seem to love ans respect.

Jean Reno plays Petrovich, which is not at all a stereotypical russian name. He owns the sport, or the team, or some part of the sport/team. He is just there, and I never really felt anything twords him.

The rest of the cast is just there, and we seem to care very little about them. They are just there to make Cross and Ridle look good.

The acting is subpar, with the exception of LL. No one seems to care about what they are doing, and it shows. Reno could have made a better movie in his sleep. He was my favorite part of Godzilla! But he just couldn't do the same for this movie.

The story is weak, at best. It is all anti-establishment, media is the devil bull-hockey. Without giving too much away, all I can say is the people like the sport, the people like the hero, and I hate the movie.

The directing style also irked me to no end. It was all close ups, and shakey camera. It made the sport very hard to follow, and gave me a headache. One scene was filmed entirely in Night-Vision... Very poorley.

This movie tries to preach that the media is bad, and that random violence is worse. All the media cares about is the ratings. This has to be one of the most hypocrtical morals I have ever heard.

A movie trying to preach against the evils of the media, and the evils of sensless violence... I can see at what they are getting at, and it seems to me that they tried to add the moral for a good reason. They tried. I can tell, but... The movie starts with senseless violence, ends with MAJOR SENSELESS VIOLENCE, and I am pretty sure there is sensless violence in the middle, too.

There were some parts I did enjoy. No wait... I really didn't enjoy this mush at all...

All in all, I give RollerBall a heartfelt

*1/2 out of *****.

Because they tried."
1703,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Ok, so this movie is terrible. There is no doubt of that. However, there is one scene worth mentioning. The action/chase scene towards the end of the movie that was filmed totally with night vision - now that was cool.

It would have been your standard chase scene in almost every action movie, however it was fresh and new in that it was done with the night vision. It actually grabbed your attention and held it through the whole portrayal of the chase - and in fact it even built some tension because it helped give the eerie almost unnerving feeling of racing in the dark.

I cannot recommend that you avoid this movie strongly enough, especially if you liked the original. Not even the extreme sports buffs could get anything out of this terrible film. It epitomizes everything that is wrong with most action movies coming out of Hollywood today. Comically bad storyline, terrible dialogue (which, for the most part, is completely drowned out by the nu-metal soundtrack), and the most bizarre and overlong night-vision sequence ever, all combine to make this the worst movie I have rented in years.

Second, what is going on? I have enough trouble figuring out what is happening half the time. The green stuff? That must have been the dust. Needless to say the only enjoyable part was Jean Reno. While incapable of playing a weak character, this was just not his movie.

In terms of the actual sport, how could that be pleasant? The arena's about the size of a skate park, and not much room to move either. I would not be one to play in that space. So, in summary, don't waste your money. Watch it for free on"

1709,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Rollerball had it all. An all-star cast consisting of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, that guy from American Pie, and Ladies Love Cool James. The director's vision was most definitely realized in full. The strong character development and excellent plot will pull the viewer into a world they never wanted to enter... and will never want to enter ever again. This movie is action meets art.

The plot would shift every time the viewer thought they had finally figured it out. There were more twists than a broken slinky, and that was only during the first 20 minutes. The movie would introduce a new character, only to kill them off several minutes later. If you listen hard enough during quieter parts of the movie, you can hear the last breaths of many of the careers of the actors in this movie. Rollerball and its stars should have been nominated for academy awards, though they should not have won any.

The blisteringly average editing and the chase scene filmed in night vision (for no apparent reason) made this movie blindingly spectacular.(Read: This movie made you want to tear your eyes from your head.) Rollerball was not a complete failure, however. It succeeded at being terrible.

I wonder what Hollywood was thinking when they created this movie. I wonder if the script actually read well and it was the actors and the editors and the directors that made the movie dismal. I would have to ask just one question. Why? I would ask that question to everyone who worked on the movie and I would bet that my response would be something to the tune of ""Why not?"" If this is a movie that did well in the theaters, then America will watch anything and I am sad for being a part of it."

I can't say I would recommend this on any count, as watching Ticker is the only thing that keeps me from calling Rollerball the worst movie of 2002. But if you like the extreme sports action take on roller derby shown here, you may just want to part with the rental fee. Otherwise, skip it!

1720,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Just one guy's opinion, but this is not a good movie. Two noteworthy elements of badness: first, the insistent jump cut/slow-mo cinematics, the likes of which could make even Oliver Stone nauseous; and lets not forget the excruciating ""getaway"" sequence, shot through some fuzzy night vision filter that leaves us expecting a pan to Geraldo Rivera reporting live via satellite from war-torn Baghdad. On the whole a visual nightmare. A far cry from the McTiernan of the late '80s who we came to trust for a decent action flick. But, no point in drudging up the past or the plot for that matter...was there one? Still, in all fairness a solid believable story is not what we want from a movie like this, but at least give us something coherent. This plot, with all its vague allusions and exhaustively cryptic reaction shots, provides an experience not unlike hearing an inside joke not intended for you. Which leads me to ask, was this movie intended for anyone? Well, you be the judge, but something in my gut tells me that somewhere some filmmakers are enjoying a hardy chuckle my expense; in which case, good...at least this movie has given someone some pleasure."

I saw Rollerball at a movie marathon and fortunately I cannot remember what happened,partly because I fell asleep about 6 times.But here is what I do remember - the movie starts with that guy from American Pie skateboarding down a hill or something like that.I was having trouble opening my M&Ms so I looked down for a few seconds.However when I looked up,the same guy was rollerblading around an arena with a bunch of other guys wearing Power Ranger masks.HMMMM WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?I remember a couple of guys falling off motorbikes and then when I woke up some guy was smashing through a window

You find yourself being dragged unwillingly through the different scenes instead of catapulted. A change in cast could possibly have fixed this if it were not for the poor direction. The cast look confused as to where their coming from, rightfully so as we are never really told as the audience either. The editing style doesn't suit the film. The uneven cuts are (I assume) meant to add an element of speed/intensity, instead they just look like dodgy editing.

1739,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Man, this movie sucks. Although I have never seen the original, I have unfortunately seen this... I'll just keep my words brief...

Acting - Absolutely abysmal... so bad that I think Shane McMahon's two second cameo and Paul Heyman's announcing gig are pretty much the best acting in this movie. (And apparently, so did a lot of other people - as certain reviews have made mention of Heyman's exciting performance as a Rollerball announcer.) When two then-sports entertainers show more impressive acting ability than the actual Hollywood actors cast in the picture, you've got problems.

Plot - Lacking. It's an EXTREME sports movie... which already disinterests me from the get-go. And yet as I watch it, I can somehow feel my soul wither away as I attempt to follow the excruciatingly awful storyline. Terrible.

Visuals - Holy crap on a stick, this movie looks appalling. Absolutely terrible. There's nothing visually appealing here - even the token post- apocalyptic features have some reasonable visuals. This is just really ugly. An eyesore to say the least... especially in regards to those HORRENDOUS night vision sequences.

Sound - My ears bleed listening to this noise. It's just awful.

Direction - Lacking. Just... no.

Editing - Bad. More emphasis is spent on close-ups and horrible acting than on the sport itself. In fact, the pacing is so bad that I often lose track of what's going on, but I'm too scared to go back and rewatch because that means subjecting myself to this horrible mess.

Overall - Pure crap movie. Just pathetic.

1740,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"In the 70s, James Caan starred in the original version of this movie. That movie packed a punch with action and commentary about the social aspects of the action/violence as to how it affected society. Chris Klein (American Pie series) stars in this remake and to paraphrase...""Chrs Klein, you are no James Caan!"" Klein is a out of work hockey player recruited into the newest sports attraction by his long time buddy, played by LL Cool J. The sport is played in the former soviet countries and is becoming a major force on television. Klein discovers that the owners are creating accidents on the field specifically to pump the ratings and tries to get out of the game. Unfortunately for Klein he is discovered and the owners begin an attempt to take out the biggest star in the game for the big ratings pay day. This movie, to put it bluntly, blew chucks. On the whole the acting was atrocious but that could be blamed to the incredibly poor writing of the story. The took a movie which was multi-layered and slammed it down into a MTV-like video and destroyed it. John McTiernan, the director, has down some incredible movies (Die Hard) but here all he should be doing is apologizing for the trash that he made of this movie. The only two performances that were at all decent in this movie came from Shane McMahon (yes the son of the WWE owner) who played an American Media Mogul who didn't say anything and from Paul Heyman (yes the guy who appears on WWE shows as either a manager or commentator) who acted as a play-by-play announcer. Granted he has had a lot of experience doing that before but he actually did some good here. Outside of those two I can think of nothing good to say about this movie."

1742,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"The original had something to say, even if sophomoric (with a big point being that in the future, governments will become irrelevant, yielding their purpose to private corporations). But this??

Just rented it. Really bad. Much of it makes no sense whatsoever, in that there is no motivation for, or reason behind, much of what happens during the story. The ""owner"" who has much, much financial incentive to keep this game going turns unexpicably maniacal in the climactic scene. He didn't get to be who he was by being that nuts, such that he gloats over the killing of the goose (the game) who would otherwise be dropping golden eggs for him. Small things: two people, travelling together from point A to point B. How do they get there? one drives a car, the other a motorcycle. Why did they not go together in one vehicle? So the car can be torched by an angry mob at point B. So they brought the motorcycle to get back to point A, I guess. Other small thing: High Greek Orthodox priest happily arrives in what is WWF type entertainment, and acts pleased to be in owner's box? Why? So he could walk out in disgust as things fall apart, to show us that what the owner staged is a bad thing.

Film assumes audience is very, very dumb.

Just looked at grosses. The original (made 25 years before the remake) outgrossed the remake, with 1975 dollars. I guess the audiences weren't so dumb to attend this bad film."

I admit, I am a long time Rollerball fan, and I had read somewhere that such people might appreciate this. WRONG. I probably would have rented it even if I had read the comments here first, but at least I would have expected (expectorated) excrement. This is not the worst movie I have ever seen. It wasn't truly sick, and the idea of the whole thing taking place in the ""'Stans"" (as in As;ugousdrhstan) was kind of cool. I thought maybe it was a prequel, until they started with the Jon A Ton chant (four months into it and he's the greatest player ever.) When he throws his hat to the crowd, I knew for sure it was just a pathetic remake. And while James Caan went with his helmet unbuckeled for much of the movie, he was too cool to touch. Our (hero?) must glue his helmet (or maybe nails it on) to his head, because he keeps it on until the near end. I have a generally low taste threshold in movies. I like a good flic, but I can tolerate nearly anything and find some enjoyment. The only redeeming social value I can place on this is to see the original with all its textures and the Albionini music, and then see this to compare just how bad and wrong a remake can possibly be. I thought ""The Last Castle"" was pitiful as a remake of ""The Hill,"" but it had enjoyment value. This has nothing. Nothing. Not even half way decent gratuitous violence. Nothing. Pathetic."
1744,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"What a waste of money and time! This movie had me falling asleep towards the end. Just another dumb attempt to remake a classic sci-fi film that had a message.

1745,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Okay. I've seen bad movies before (Feeders, Castle Freak, Jurassic Park 2), and rented Rollerball because I heard it was bad. But hey, it might be bad-fun, right? As in at least funny and easy to mock, right?

Oh no. Oh no no no. Rollerball is an entirely different breed of film altogether. While it at least has some good lighting, and a soundtrack not ripped right out of another film, every single other aspect of this 'movie' (cause it has moving frames of still pictures running together to create a flow) is like a car accident. Some people turn away in disgust and shock, some look, then turn away, and some can't turn away because of the sheer appalling nature of what they see. That's Rollerball -- a cinematic 15 car pileup.

Where to start? How about the 15 (or 30...It felt soooooo long) min stretch of film done in Night Vision? Who has the night vision? The director? God? Who is using the night vision to relay the scene we're watching? Normally, a director uses altered modes of filming to depict altered states of mind of characters, or monsters (Alien 3 fish-eye lens), etc. Here, it's just a scene done in night vision. I thought it was going to be a gimmick, like the characters were being watched by a helicopter, but that hope, that fiendish desire, faded after the night vision just stayed on the screen...WHY????!!!!!!

Oh what else? What next...okay, how about the premise of the movie. Violence is bad, especially in sports...but wait...people watch NASCAR for car crashes (some of them) and hockey for fights...and I love football, partly because it's a violent sport...and isn't the whole point of Rollerball (not having seen the original) that the sport distinguishes itself from others through violence? Rollerball in the movie isn't nearly as violent as a cricket match until the incomprehensible last 15 min...so is McTiernan trying to seem 'smart' by showing that people like violence in sports and that's bad? Is Rollerball an art form, being corrupted by the violence of filthy eurotrash capitalists (sorry Jean Reno, but this was not your finest hour)?

To be fair, I was drinking Maker's Mark during the movie, thinking it might help...and it kind of did. I at least began to overlook Chris 'Little Keanu' Klein's 'acting', but couldn't handle the 'editing', which seemed to have cut the original shoot of the movie apart, threw the shreds in the air, and then glued them together as they picked them up. And the plot also got easier to handle...after the insipid opening where Klein goes from homeless to superstar in one fade cut...WOW! I wanna try...I'm typing right now...gentle fade to black...fade in, and I'm Sultan of my own province in Asia! Hey!

This whole pile of crap smacks of having been birthed in a corporate startegy meeting at MGM, where McTiernan was just sitting, listening to 'Think-tank' solutions for MGM's flagging profits: 'Hey,' says one thirty-ish blonde executive, 'the kids LOVE night-vision nowadays...(snaps fingers)How about a whole scene in Night-Vision!' 'Sure!' says McTiernan, desperate for a hit. 'How about we also get those bands the kids love nowadays...you know, that Pink girl, oh and Slipknot!!! The kids love Slipknot!!' 'And we'll film it like an hour and a half music video,' says another short-haired exec. 'You know, with the 'jump-cuts' (doing the whole quote-finger manuever) and all! So the kids will love it! And it'll save out on costs typing the screenplay and editing, cause the kids don't like those anyways!' (execs give each other high fives, McTiernan scuttles away to start shooting)

I digress. Don't watch this 'movie'. Even if you like bad movies, you won't be entertained. Don't watch it if you like pain -- you're better off cutting yourself with a razorblade. Don't watch it if you want a trippy, incomprehensible series of images and sounds that leave you with a headache -- drink the 'milkoline' I suggested at the top here."

1749,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"I've read the reviews and comments posted about this movie. I also bought the DVD having never before seen the movie. And you know, I'm not sorry I did. Is it a great movie? No, certainly not. Is it even a good movie? I suppose its depends on your point of view. Here's mine:

When the original Rollerball made its debut here in the 70's, I was in line on the first evening. Its been one of my favorites ever since. not because its a great movie or had some stellar acting (James Caan, at the time, couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag even if he had a sword). It was, however, entertaining. It allowed me to set aside the day's BS and just watch the carnage.

This new movie is very similar in that respect. I enjoyed it. I wasn't looking for a message. I wasn't looking for King Lear or Hamlet. After reading some of the reviews on this site, I was half expecting Eraserhead or Plan 9 from Outer Space. I was pleasently surpri"
1750,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"To preface this, I am a huge John McTiernan fan. Predator ranks right behind Aliens, in my opinion as the best Sci-Fi action movie ever. Die Hard invented a whole genre of film unto itself. Remember Die Hard on a plane? Passenger 57. Die Hard on a boat? Under Siege.

Hunt for Red October was hailed as the best sub movie since Das Boot. Still is in my opinion. Thomas Crown Affair was better then the original. I hear the first cut of 13th Warrior was outstanding (Michael Crichton re-shot and re-edited much of McTiernan's original film). Die Hard: With a Vengeance was a masterful sequel.

Personally, I like Medicine Man, but I can see why a lot of people did not. The Last Action Hero had a horrible story, but it was well directed.

Rollerball, much like Last Action Hero, was also a horrible story. The difference was McTiernan's direction was absolutely rancid. The editing was amateurish. The music was mundane. And the direction was awful, oh wait, I already said that.

The plot involves a wayward amateur athlete in the 'States hoping to get his break. He does in the form of a childish sport involving roller blades, motorcycles, steel balls and viewer ratings. For some reason he gets paid lots of money, but when a dimwitted teammate gets creamed upside the head with one of the afore mentioned steel balls, he suddenly develops a conscious, after all he's only making ""100 times more"" than his teammates. Why would he care if one gets knocked off?

What follows is a terrible story that tries to involve the audience on some pseudo-political level, but never even gets close. Jean Reno plays the owner of, apparently, not only the central team, but the league as a whole. LL Cool J plays a throw away part as Chris Klein's best friend. And Rebecca Romjin Stamos plays Chris' teammate/love interest. We don't care about any of the characters, they're never fleshed out. And they're doing something so childish, that even if they were, we still wouldn't care.

The direction is so terrible, that it looks like it was edited on someone's home computer by an inept amateur. There are silly things like an entire night scene that is shot with a green tint. I assume that this is supposed to give me the feeling that I'm watching this through night vision goggles. Basically it made me want to fall asleep. Later on in the same scene two vehicles bust through a wire fence and there is a, I'm not kidding here, ""sproing"" sound. Much like the sound one would hear in a Wiley Coyote cartoon. Both vehicles make this sound. That basically describes the whole movie. You sit back, scratch your head and say, ""did I just see that? And if I did, that was terrible.""

I can't say the entire movie was awful, the opening race through San Francisco had McTiernan's usual flare and panache. An ensuing car chase scene through some dirt roads in the Ukraine wasn't bad either. But the rest can be flushed right down the commode.

1751,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"I didn't expect much, as word of mouth was bad. But this is worse than I

an uninpired, sloppy job as director of a remake starring a bunch of no-good

nobodies. I have seen my share of poor remakes, but this is the bottom of the barrel. Ugly and undynamic photography. The Rollerball sequences are

desastrous, confusing, poorly editited. The least poor scenes of this movie are the lugaring scenes down the San Francisco streets in the beginning of the film. I don't know why Norman Jewison's great 1975 movie was remade. Rent the

1752,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"I don't know how a talented action director such as John McTiernan could end up with a piece of trash such as ""Rollerball."" Last time I checked, movies were supposed to be entertaining and fun.

One of the many problems is the sloppy editing, which was obviously made to cut the dialogue out. Now I've had experiences with poor editing in movie, but what I saw in ""Rollerball"" was ridiculous. Sometimes, it's literally impossible to understand what's going on. And the camerawork isn't much help, either.

There are two kinds of bad movies: The kind so bad, it's hilarious, and the other kind is just plain bad. Unfortunately, ""Rollerball"" would have to fall into the second category. Believe me when I say I've never seen anything as bad as ""Rollerball."" Luckily, I only rented it on DVD after seeing so many negative reviews. And that was one of the biggest mistakes I'd ever made.

Not many movies get to be as bad as ""Rollerball."" I still can't understand why a whole action sequence was shot with an infrared camera, and why a motorcycle crashing through the gate makes a Looney Tunes cartoon sound. The film doesn't even pretend to be serious, and still, it's not even worth watching; it had no business being at the movie theaters and has no business being sold in video stores.

I don't think many movies will ever get to be as bad as ""Rollerball."" It seems the stunt people are the only ones actually doing their job, the rest of the characters just seem to be little more than elements of second unit. Avoid ""Rollerball"" at all costs. F- (This is a little too kind.)"

1755,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"I just finished watching this movie. I had read some comments on this site, ad I had been warned. But I confess: I love violent movies. Some people may think that that makes me a nutcase, but as much as I hate real life violence, I like movie violence.

Well... I expected a violent movie... I expected the Rollerball-game to be cruel and ultraviolent. And it is violent at times, but it is also a sissy-game of jumping and posing. And the game is not the main plot of the movie... Everybody who saw Salute to a Jugger/Blood of Heroes knows what a violent futuristic game looks like... This is not it!

Okay, so I was disappointed about the violence which mainly takes part in the last 15 minutes, but also the story is going nowhere. Several times I caught myself thinking what dinner I should eat tonight, and if I should go shopping.... That means the movie stinks! The camera, the editing, everything is so bad. Nothing saves this movie.

Unless you have been very bad and want to torture yourself, do not watch.

P.S. Since the movie has some violent action scenes, I give it a 4/10, but if you are not a gorehound, the score will be less."
1756,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"I finished watching this movie a quarter of an hour ago, and frankly I enjoyed it,well maybe because I wanted to have fun. LL Cool J acts very well and Rebecca Romjin Stamos used this tough movie to train herself for the upcoming X-men sequel. I agree with those who say that it reminds of the Fast and the Furious and in fact I liked that movie too. Jean Reno 's blameworthy, I must admit it and I don' t know why he starred in this movie.

From the quality of these films, you would think he would make only good quality movies. I can assure you that Rollerball is not good, not quality, and not worth seeing. From the opening scene of the movie to the last scene, the movie is just stupid violence and action that shouldn't even be called action. It makes a laughing stock of the original '70's film. The acting is no better than a high school play, the plot is unconvincing, and the whole story is just stupid.

1758,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"First off I'm gonna respond to this comment though. ""First off, let me explain why I hate reviews. THEY ARE FREAKING OPINIONS! Dont let somebody else ruin what could be a good experience for you. ""

How so true. They are opinions. I love imdb.com for this. I can listen to normal people make decent reviews. It's a good debate. I don't have a problem with Roger Ebert. Sure he's a critic. I usually agree with him when he gives em thumbs up. But not thumbs down. Leonard Malten (sp??) I do happen to have a problem with. He's rather stuck up in my opinion. But indeed. I can't get angry with people I disagree with. I'm still reeling from the cancelation of Politically Incorrect. I was usually in disagreement with Bill, but he created a great debate.

So onto this movie. I didn't think a movie could be this bad considering it's a remake. Oh but it isn't. It ripped the name off. The Get Carter movies are more comparable than this.

Let's get started: 1. The ring is too small. 2. oops it wasn't a ring. 3. there is no direction in this movie. 4. Jean Reno made a fool of himself in the movie. 5. Topless women doesn't prove anything. 6. this was no vision. 7. the rules are confusing. 8. hell the movie is confusing. 9. Where's my mommy? 10. there's not a single character that was in the original. Jonathon E. Became Jonathon Cross. 11. The gloves aren't deadly. 12. There's no character development. and finally 13. The story has nothing to do with the game. o_O

With the original... it was the future. 2018. The lead star Johnny E was in the game for what? 10 years. This Cross idiot was here for 4 months. That and it's 2005. Indiana Jones 4 will be out by then.

The original movie has great design. Was more arena like. And didn't look like WWE style. The original had to do with a corporate world with no wars. People couldn't remember the past. They had no books.

This movie is about what happens with that very corporate world gets there hands on creating another Rollerball. And utterly destroys the very meaning of the first movie.

So if your pro Microsoft. Pro biz. Pro violence. Yahoo for you. But if you loved the original because it was anti violence. Stay the hell away.

1761,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"I was stunned when I heard the budget for this movie was $ 85.000.000 ! Beats me who wanted to invest that much money into this piece of crap, what were they thinking!

The good thing is that the best scene takes place at the first 5 minutes of the movie, during the street race. After that it's going downhill and it's going downhill fast!

The biggest problem with this movie is that the director wants you to believe Rollerball is real, but the way this concept is presented to the viewer is so poor and downright amateurish, that it rather made me laugh than feeling any compassion for the characters. Let alone the plot, which seems to be a collection of random 'cool' situations added together, what a stinker!

I hate it not to watch to the end of a movie, but Rollerball gave me itchy fingers. I did watch it to the end and I shouldn't have...and neither should you, I think.

If you want to see a ""TV-Show to the death"" movie, try Running Man instead, it's really a lot better than this one!

1764,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Bad acting, bad scripting and bad direction comprises most of Rollerball a remake of the 70's hit by the same name. First of all Chris Klien can not act at all. He is worse than Keanu Reeves. The movie revolves around a pointlessly confusing sport called rollerball, a violent game that mixes hockey with lacrosse. Klien is the star player of the game but he finds that things begin to smell funny and starts to uncover a conspiracy (think Running Man meets Snake Eyes). This movie tryes to be a ultra cool, sleek romp that should be lots of fun and highly entertaining. But what it turns out to be is a huge confusing mess that is suprisingly violent and with a suprsingly high amount of nudity. I don't know what John McTiernan was thinking when he through in an escape scene that was comptly shot in night vision green.

1765,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Somewhere deep inside John McTiernan's supposed' action fest is a tepid social commentary on the direction in which the line between sports and entertainment are intersecting. Rollerball is at best a hybrid of social commentary sprinkled with some of the worst acting, scripting, directing seen on the silver screen in a long time. Director John McTiernan has been in a slump over the past decade with the engineering of many mediocre films. Starting with Last Action Hero back in 1993, excluding Die Hard: With a Vengeance, and The Thomas Crown Affair (which really wasn't McTiernan's forte) this Director has not been consistent with his filmmaking. Therefore, skepticism was high upon screening this film. I have always admired this Director for his previous efforts and he always seems to hatch something new, yet in this film, it sinks to a new low. The film commences with its' hard rock and fervent editing in hopes of imparting upon the audience the dizzying effect this film wants to emit. Unfortunately, its' grand production values and mock storytelling cannot hide the fact that this is a poorly made film. Chris Klein stars as a young athlete unable to make a name for himself in North America Professional Sport. On a suggestion from his best friend Marcus (LL Cool J), he joins an overseas Sports Entertainment Empire called Rollerball. This mix of fast paced drudgery and furious speed leads to serious ramifications which question the integrity of the sport. Jean Reno plays Petrovich, an entrepreneur who decides to sell the sport as the most violent and fast piece of entertainment in order to land a contract with the North American market. Operating in remote and hostile countries in the Middle East, Petrovich wants to take the sport International and slowly escalates the game's danger in hopes of attracting ratings. Jean Reno does his worst to bring no class and no charisma to this awkward character while Chris Klein is just deplorable as even his beard seems painted on for how young he is to play the lead in this kind of film. McTiernan does his best to capture the ferocity of such a sport but fails horrible in what is the most taxing 90 minutes for a film. I can respect the fact that the film is not as visually a debacle as it could have been, nor is it as bad as I thought it would be but it still is a bad film. One can simply take a look at any 10 minutes of the film and derive their own assumptions about the film; the elements that make a film a film are lacking in this piece. The only noteworthy and experimental aspect would be a scene of several minutes duration in which McTiernan lenses the scene with a NightVision Lens (Those green, grainy images) in order to evoke a feeling of compete and utter darkness. But that soon gives way to a mockery of a scene as all reality and excitement is washed away with some of the worst filmmaking in a long time.

1767,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"I've watched both the 1975 and the 2002 remake versions of ""Rollerball"", a story set in a future where the number one form of entertainment is a barbaric sport in which the players roller blade or motorbike around a small court and chase after a silver ball and put it inside a goal. In both versions, the star player of Rollerball is a character named Jonathan (Chris Klein here, James Caan in the original) who after a series of near-death accidents occurs, decides to revolt against the bloodthirsty and corrupt business officials who may have something to do with the accidents.

It's obvious why the release date for this film was pushed back so many times. The reason is because people just didn't like it. For me, this is one of the first cases where I actually prefer the original to a remake. One thing I really like about the original is that even though there is very little action, it still had a running theme throughout the movie. ""Rollerball"" is supposed to be talking about the corruption of human beings by an oppressive government. That message is lost here in the remake largely because of mindless dialogue between the characters and pointless action sequences outside of the sport. The remake is slow, loud, and kind of boring (though not on the sleep level of boring). Of course, John McTiernan, who directed ""Die Hard"", directs this movie. So you know that at least the action sequences will be good.

This film bares almost no resemblance to the original except for the names of the movie and the lead character. In both versions, we see a total of three games, so it's best to assume that there's only three games in a season. Also in both versions, the producers change the rules so that in the final game there are no penalties or fouls to be called, which leads to the total annihilation of the players of both teams. Predictably, by the time the bloodshed of the final game is over, only the lead character is left standing to make the winning shot and then leads the revolt against the evil controllers of the sport.

P.S.: The only really good thing about this movie is the performance by heavy metal band Slipknot."

1769,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"To begin with, I never had high expectations for ""Rollerball"". It was supposed to be released what seems like years ago, and kept getting pushed back. That being said, one would think that meant they were making it better. Thank God they didn't ""fix"" it any more than they did. Other than the great Jean Reno, (whom I now pity for being in this movie) I was left wondering where the hell the actors and actresses were. I couldn't find any. Did anyone else? The editing was terrible and the ""Blair Witch"" cameraman did a better job showing us what was going on. The supposed ""action"" scenes were extremely tough to follow and frustrating. Four minutes of night vision didn't help either. The cartoony BOING! of going through a fence got me laughing, as did the supposed speed of 120 MPH as we see the road passing underneath them at about 30. And how about that fight at the end? Wow... that was about as exciting as watching grass grow. When it was all over, I was amazed that it was only an hour and a half long. The ever so slight glimmer of hope of Slipknot's performance was quickly dashed by more bad acting and editing. I'm tempted to take the DVD back to the rental store and demand a refund. If nothing else, tell them to pull the copies of this abomination from their shelves to save business. giving myself a root canal while being held over hot coals with gremlins twisting corkscrews into my feet would have been more entertaining.

They took away the whole thing and set it in Russia and well. There was no plot. Some things just got lost, but then that was OK, since we just fast forwarded through much anyway. The REALLY BAD editing hurt my eyes. I mean, I mean, no self respecting editor could watch it. No self respecting 6th grader editing home movies on a VCR could watch it! I mean it was really bad.

1771,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Rollerball is one long smorgasbord of smash-ups, crashes and body blows. It's a big mess of a movie that fails to establish strong characters or to set up a logical design of the dangerous sport the characters participate in. The guilty party for this disaster is director John McTiernan, who previously has been reliable with such strong and intelligent action-adventure movies like Die Hard, The Hunt for Red October and The Thomas Crown Affair. What was he thinking?

For those unfamiliar with the 1975 version of Rollerball with James Caan, this film will be especially difficult to follow. Watching the original film before seeing this remake is essential because the old version plays like Cliff Notes in order to follow the action. The original movie wasn't a great film but at least it established interesting ideas about corporation rule in a futuristic society which operated in totalitarian rule under CEO's. This film attempts to satirize the extent producers will go for television ratings. In the original film, the game of rollerball was a fusion of hockey, football and motocross with gladiator brutality. This time the game is interrupted by constant cutting with complete absence of clarity and the arena is so small that it's claustrophobic mayhem instead of having a big arena with competitive design like in Norman Jewison's original film.

What's worse is that the casting is all wrong. Chris Klein is too baby-faced and non-threatening to play Jonathan Cross, the athlete that becomes a hero for the masses while challenging the integrity of the game. LL Cool J is his teammate Marcus Ridley that wants to help Cross get out of the game once it starts getting deadly in the arena. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos plays the love interest to Jonathan and scarred teammate in this unisex sport. Jean Reno plays the evil executive owner of this dangerous sport league, doing little but snicker from his owner's box seat or shouting incomprehensibly at his lackies.

The history behind this troubled production is revealing. Director John McTiernan in the spring of 2001 invited online critic Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News to take a look at an early screening. Despite being an admirer of the modern action film, he simply stated it sucked and bad buzz leaked everywhere. The film was pushed from an August release so the filmmakers could work on its problems. The studio was concerned with its length of two hours and about the incoherence of the action. McTiernan returned behind the camera in the fall to shoot additional scenes for two weeks. What is evident is that additional photography could not clear anything up, not with the mess of earlier footage that could be assimilated in the editing. The running time was cut, and with a reported $60 million running tag, the film's blood and gore was cut to insure a PG-13 rating. Luring young teenagers into this fiasco was the studio's only chance to make their money back. The final edit remains a muddled, and discreetly tame, work of shame.

There is constant noise on the soundtrack, the pacing is as reckless and frenetic as a bad video game and with constant attention to overlong action scenes, this lends to little character development. The game itself is so burdened by the suffocated design of the arena, so incoherent and undefined in athletic contest that it would more logically crumble faster than the XFL."

1773,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Before I say anything, let me dispel the myth that the R-rated version of this film made some valid artistic statement and was gutted by the studio and MPAA to achieve the coveted PG-13. Having just viewed the R-rated DVD I can honestly say there is no aspect of this film that is not stunningly bad.

McTiernan seems to be attempting some sort of convoluted style that actively gets in the way of storytelling. Don't get me wrong here - there really isn't a story to get in the way of (Rollerball being the worst excuse of a film to merely be a few big action sequences spliced together since Mission Impossible). The camera work and editing are the worst elements of the film. The cameras in the rollerball arena are very static and never really draw the viewer into the action. Every dialog scene has some distracting jump cut within it. It's highly distracting and does more to bring the viewer out of the film rather than draw him in. McTiernan also uses footage of semi-dressed athletes that looks like stock footage from deodorant commercials to transition between scenes. Very few elements of the film don't beg the question ""what were they thinking?"" Perhaps the greatest beggar of them all is the scene presented entirely with a green night-vision effect. The effect isn't used because the scene is from the perspective of a character wearing night-vision goggles. It really just brings up more questions for which there are no answers. Am I in the scene? Did I just put on night-vision goggles? Why wasn't I wearing sunglasses during the opening sequence? Or a helmet? If the film hadn't been so bad up until this point, I would have checked the settings on my television to see what had gone wrong. All that had gone wrong was that I had rented this terrible movie.

Even the stars have nothing good to say about the film. The audio commentary on the DVD provided by Chris Klein, LL Cool J and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is frequently silent. I'm sure they're invoking the ""If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all"" rule from childhood. The only time they can muster much excitement is in regard to driving the Shelby Cobra and other vehicles used in the film.

The film purports to be a cautionary tale about violent entertainment and the greedy global corporations who put their profit ahead of their employee's well being, but the extremely violent ending of this film released by multinational MGM in which many stars risked injury doing their stunts (""I had a stunt where I had to jump a ramp and save a young lady whose motorcycle was on fire,"" says LL Cool J, ""I pulled her off her bike, but when she let go, the handlebars hooked onto the spur of my boot. So here I am riding with a burning motorcycle hanging off my leg. It was crazy."") renders the message moot. This may be the greatest on-screen irony since Kenneth Branagh delivered Hamlet's advice to the players sawing the air with his hand and splitting the ears of groundlings.

My advice to those interested in seeing this film: move along, there's nothing to see here."
1774,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Now I haven't seen the original ""Rollerball,"" but the old Normal Jewison flick didn't get such glowing reviews either, so it's not like millions of audiences came forward and hollered, ""The original was so much better! Why did they have to butcher it???"" The previews looked really cool. And the previews...are the movie! Aside from the spectacular opening skateboarding sequence, all the coolness the movie has to offer was given in the previews, and as an added bonus set to the jamming sounds of Limp Bizkit. And for those renting the DVD, it's not a total loss. Hell, I least I got to see some bare boobs. The uncut, R-rated version is available on DVD. So for those thinking of renting this flick--only rent it if you're absolutely desperate to see some bare boobs. I feel even sorrier for those who had to watch this crap in theaters WITHOUT the nudity!

I just found out that the movie was re-edited countless times because of disastrous preview screenings. That alone hints that it's gonna be a crappy movie. I could be wrong, but so far I don't recall seeing a good movie that got its release date pushed and pushed and pushed. The same thing happened with that horrible movie, ""Soul Survivors."" And I should've gotten a clue when a big, over-hyped action movie like this bombed, even in the first week. Even some of the crappy action movies do wonders at the box office.

John McTiernan, director of ""Die Hard"" and ""Die Hard with a Venegance,"" does the best he can, and even overdoes it. Some shots seem flashy for the sake of being flashy. A few of the flashy images are fetching, but most of them just look gratuitous. But McTiernan was working with such a shallow, meaningless script that he tried hard to keep this clunker afloat. So I appreciate the effort. But I gotta say, that green-light chase scene--What the hell was that about?

Every square inch of this movie spells ""forgettable."" Take away big stars like Chris Klein, LL Cool J and Jean Reno, along with the huge production values, and you got yourself direct-to-video filler. Why did French character actor Jean Reno degrade himself in such a one-note role? How many zeros were in that paycheck? It's tragic to experience such a fine actor like him laugh maniacally and spurt out horrible lines of dialogue. As for Klein and LL--they'd jump off a 100-story building for a film if it promised a huge paycheck. Let them degrade themselves. At least I get to see the beautiful Rebecca Romijn-Stamos. She's no actress, but in such an utterly trash flick like this I wasn't a stickler for acting. Topless Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is pretty much the highlight of ""Rollerball.""

This is an example of art imitating life. Extreme sports didn't prove successful with the XFL, and people didn't have to pay to see that! That just proves how successful extreme sports will fare in cinema.

1775,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"I never saw the original, but maybe that will help me to make this post into a critique rather than a comparison. Well, from the start of this movie it seemed it had nothing going for it. I was actually looking forward to seeing it, seeing as how I enjoyed Die Hard very much. But...well to start with, Chris Kline is a laughable Keannu Reeves wannabe. The movie itself is a Fast and the Furious wannabe. While I thought the latter was great, this movie...well, err...is not. As the movie progressed my patience slowly regressed, and I was happy when it was over. So, this kid Kline is a street luger (is that spelled right?), a potential hockey superstar, the greatest rollerballer ever, and a natural jackass. what can't he do??? Well, act is one thing. Quite funny how he seems like he never knows what's going on. And the ending is very bad. If you've seen it, than you can understand that by doing what he did, he lowered his standards to the ""tyrant's"" level, and is no better than the rich owners that controlled him. He went out to stop the violence, and caused an extremely violent, bloody riot in the process complete with fighting audience members, overturned cars, and setting fires.

1779,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"The rumours of the test screenings were bad enough. This film only thinly resembles the original in the actual game. From there, it takes a hard left turn and continues to spiral downward.

The remake was bad enough with a lifeless Chris Klein, who's stunningly lame work in ""Say It Isn't So"" must have been some inspiration for this turn in his lackluster career. Also, there has got to be some law passed preventing ex-rappers from becoming actors. It's worse than Elvis being shoved in front of a camera.

However, knowing that this was once an R rated movie, and in order to recover what must have been stunning prospects of losses at the box office, neutered down to a PG-13 rating with bad digital shadows to cover up Rebecca Romin-Stamos' nudity, doesn't make it an easier pill to swallow.

Add to that some of the worse editing during the actual matches that leave you with your eyes hurting from cuts away from the action, this turns into one turkey of a movie. Not so bad as to be un-intentionally funny, but bad enough to be an insult."
1780,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"OK, it doesn't help that the script is a mess and generally that the movie is no good. But what ruined this was the editing. Not once do you get a clear view of what goes on, anywhere, least of all on the Rollerball court. The cuts are so frequent it plays out like one of those horrible ""in-your-face"" kung-fu movies. Makes you think that they couldn't get the actors to deliver two good lines in a row (which I know isn't true) so they just cut back and forth constantly to splice it all together.

I walked away from this movie with a headache and a feeling of anger at the 3-4 hours it felt like I wasted watching it. If any of you can bear to watch MTV anymore, think of any of the horrible videos from that band Dream, where there is a cut for literally every single second of film. Now stretch that out to 90 minutes, and there you have it. 1/10 (1 for near-nudity of Rebecca Rom"
1781,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Rollerball is a bad movie. It is extremely bad. It is unconscionably, incomprehensibly, horribly bad. Literally the one positive thing I can think to say is that Rebecca Romijn-Stamos takes her clothes off once or twice. I'm not joking. That is as good as this movie gets.

While there are dozens of things wrong with Rollerball, it's the editing that sinks it. The movie seems edited in an amphetamine-induced haze without regard to performance, plot or coherence. It is very hard to tell what is going on from one-second to the next.

Another problem is the leading man. The hero is a young American hockey player. He is an extreme sports fanatic who journeys to Russia and becomes a star player in the brutal new sport of ""rollerball."" He soon finds out that ""All Is Not What It Seems"" and has to fight for his life. The rollerball league functions like a futuristic French Foreign Legion so the hero becomes first among a brutal, subhuman pack of desperate characters. The character has to be tough, dripping with testosterone. Vin Diesel should have been a shoe-in. Instead they cast Chris Klein. Sweet, young, apple-cheeked Chris Klein. Young Chris doesn't look rough enough to watch the sport without his mommy much head the league in broken limbs. This is not a question of acting talent. This is a question of sheer physical believability. You wouldn't cast Michael Jordan as a jockey. Seeing the other actors relate to the affable Klein as if he were a berserk Klingon pushes the movie towards parody.

The other actors seem to be doing what they can but it's really very hard to tell what they are up to because of the terrible editing. There are times when the actors are cut off in mid-word! ""Hacked up"" doesn't begin to cover the effect. The person who bears the brunt of the editor's depravations is that most French of actors Jean Reno. Here he plays a Russian and between the editing and accent, his part is all but unintelligible

Sometimes cinematography can save a movie. Not Rollerball, however. When the images aren't pumped up and jarring they are dark and dreary. An entire sequence is shot in the grainy-green style of night-vision goggles. As nobody in the film is wearing goggles at this point one would assume that the director just liked the style. It may be cool but it's exceedingly hard to take for any length of time. Here you have around four minutes during which you witness major events through a muddy green fog.

Suffice it to say Rollerball should never have been released, not even direct-to-video. Honestly, you wander away from the experience wondering what caused the disaster. Quite a bit of thought and money obviously went into the film and John McTiernan is an action director of considerable talent. It should at least been an enjoyable time-waster. Instead it fails at every level. Recommend Rollerball to your worst enemy. You'll be glad you did."

I've never seen such a bad and unintelligent movie like ""Rollerball""! This movie has a story and a screenplay which I've could written in 10 minutes...

1783,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"In more than one sense the new movie is the negative of the 70's movie. The old Rollerball movie had a story, a message, actors, and a director. The new one does not have a story, does not have a message, ... you get the picture?

About ninety minutes of light and sound to fill a void and in doing this creating one. McTiernan: a philosopher? Rollerball 2002 a koan? Or just McTiernan sitting in his warm cave watching the CNN shadows of the ROW turning them into one of the longest and worst music videos in history?

The first film version had to labour under the acting of James Caan (his has improved marginally), but it did convey the essential political overtones and the de-sensitisation of the global TV audience to violence.

Rollerball 2002, seemed to be trying to depict the now without comment, and use the violence to paper over the cracks created by a paper thin treatment.

Super villians seeking global domination (if only in TV ratings), are the stuff of third rate comic books. An opportunity to make a movie that kept to the spirit of the original story, provide food for thought, and lead us on a fantastic trip was sorely mis"
1785,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"If you're into very fast cars, ultra violence, female nudity and women who are nothing more than meat then Rollerball might be just for you. But then only if you're male and under 16. And even most of them will reckon Rollerball is lousy.

Rollerball is I supposed aimed at the above but it's such a mess that I'd say that it ended up having no direction at all. Apparently the makers had this thing made in mid 2000 but after test screenings have edited it for over six months trying to recover the situation. They failed.

Those of us old enough to remember that excellent B & W TV sports show called Rollerball would perhaps be interested to see if Ronnie Raines and his buddies has been reincarnated in the 21st century. Come to think of it I would have fitted the above snotty, nasty profile fairly well in the 1960's!

A trawl of the cyber net has little mention of that marvelous television entertainment but we do find links to the 1975 James Cahn sci fi action/weepie called Rollerball. There also is or has been a television game show of the same name as well as an all in wrestling event called Rollerball, all of which would be vastly superior to this 2002 movie release.

Jean Reno (Blade Runner, The Deep Blue, Nikita, The Professional) couldn't save Rollerball, nor Chris Klein (American Pie). Even the director Johm McTiernan (Die Hard, Last Action Hero) had this one spiral out of control.

It's full of extremely fast edits, smirking baddies, pouting females, bad music, sports cars, roller blades, lost helmets and almost no nudity for those interested. And a plot that makes little sense.

If you require anything more from your movie making than some half big body blows and relentless pointless rushing about give Rollerball a miss.

She was the reason I stayed awake throughout the film (here in Mexico the movie was rated ""C"", kinda R in USA, so I thought there would be a lot of nudity, compliments from Rebecca... dream on!).

2. Jean Reno.

An actor from head to toe, great in his performance, he urgently needs a nomination for an Oscar... obviously not for this movie.

3. The night vision scene.

I love all kinds of experiments in filming, that's why I love Blair Witch Project, so I thought this type of camera gives an eerie, but great feeling to movies. This scene in Rollerball was ok, I personally think it was the best of the film.

That's it. I think I should've listened to my other friend and go see The Musketeer... but that's in the past. I went to see Rollerball, and there's nothing I can do. Wait, another thing. Slipknot was part of the soundtrack and they appeared in the film. THAT WAS GREAT!!!"

This movie also has the worst scene I have ever seen on film - the green night shot sequence in the desert. What were you doing John McT? Was it meant to be funny? What was the deal with the motorbike?? And crashing through the fence (BOING!) sounds just like the cartoons.

In summary.

The acting is bad

The dialogue is worse

The direction seems non existant.

Avoid this movie at all costs.

Shame on you MGM for releasing crap like this. How many millions of dollars were spend making this from an R to a PG-13, digitally cleaning up blood (painfully obvious). What a waste of time and money."
1790,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Wasn't it enough that Gus Van Sant destroyed whatever credibility he might claim to have had, remaking PSYCHO? Apparently not. Tim Burton had yet to insult audiences worldwide with his wimpy, trash-talkin PLANET OF THE APES. Poor old Nicolas Cage at least ""tried"" as he stumbled through the God-awful remake of GONE IN 60 SECONDS. Now though we have the benchmark in psychotic movie re-working! McTiernan has single handedly destroyed the memory of Norman Jewison's sci-fi classic of '74 - an exciting multi-layered social commentary way ahead of its time and like Psycho - totally UN-REMAKEABLE!

ROLLERBALL 2002 in totality has way less dignity and style than even the original POSTER for the James Caan epic. Set in what is now only a few years hence, ROLLERBALL is simply a corporation-hyped ratings winner. A gladiatorial roller rink with few rules, supercharged motorbikes and a healthy blood-lust. Once the viewer interest wanes, Jean Reno, in an embarrassing re-enactment of John Houseman's wonderfully understated corporate menace in the original, simply orders a spot of bovver to keep himself and his stooges cashed up, courtesy of the ramped-up audience participation!

Chris Klein obviously running a Keanu Reeves line in MATRIX-styled scowling and non-acting, is way too young for the role of Jonathan, quite apart from the fact he has less charisma than the average day Manager at KFC! The script is near incoherent, evidenced early on from the savage cutting inflicted, after disastrous test-audience reaction. Filmed as little more than a 98 minute MTV clip the action sequences are so badly choreographed with low rent pyrotechnics, the makers have fallen on the last resort of a head-banging soundtrack. Even that is totally misplaced, laughably inappropriate and evidence that most everyone involved had written the thing off way before completion.

This is a film should be compulsory viewing for everyone aspiring to any gainful employment within the film production industry. Not a solitary aspect of the movie, from direction, editing, script, acting even the production department come out looking half professional. It is also a sad legacy for a lost generation of attention-deficient young audiences who need headphones to replace constructive thought.

To say the film sucks is way too kind. This is without argument one of the greatest duds ever put up as entertainment Do yourself a favor and go rent the original, which offers style and thought-provoking brilliance from the memorable opening scene to the very last frame!"

This remake of the original Norman Jewison's masterpiece of violent satyre on the future of the media is far from the original in caustic comments on society but it's definitely sheer fun if you watch it without thinking on anything else. Sure, the story is full of preposterous archetypes and machismo runs free of any limitation, but McTiernan is a great director for action movies and this Rollerball is better than I thought of. It's like a modern day Spartacus and if a movie like Gladiator won several Oscars, this one deserves more than one vis"
1792,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Noxom of Cologne is waaay too kind to this piece of trash.

My 7 year old could have done better.

Let's see...

sound track (noise track actually) drowns every other noise/sound including dialog (bunch of unconnected words actually)I was actually reaching for a dial to fine tune the signal, as it sounded like a radio on a bad frequency.

Editing. Well, I think the director and editor used a veg-o-matic to cut, and the munchkins from the Wizard of Oz did the pasting.

Talent. Jean Reno (totally wasted talent on this...thing)

Talent, other.. well... none

If you wish to enjoy Roller Ball, stick to the original 1975 version. It is not dated and it is a movie.

This thing seems to have been conceived by Eddie Kruger on a bad hair day. Star rating? yeah right. I give it 10 black holes."
1793,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Whomever enjoys the 1975 version of Rollerball -- a piece of sincerely offered advice: Stay away from this garbage. Way away. This is a singular slice of disaster from beginning to end. The awful reviews posted here give too much credit to the thing.

Where was the director? He must have been half in the bag when directing it, and the guy doing the cutting must have been right there beside him at the bar with glass in hand. The characterizations are awful and the script even worse. Chris Klein, a reasonably acceptable actor, does an incredible job at doing a Keanu Reeves style acting demolition -- as if he were in a contest to be the worst actor on the planet, and winning.

One might think that at least the special effects and the aesthetics of the movie might exceed he original, if nothing else. Nope. Not even close. In fact the original's view of the distant future comes off better than this movie's vision of the virtual present.

Go into this movie with the lowest of expectations and it will still fail to rise to them. Remember that silly MTV video that you hated? This is longer and worse. The cuts are staccato machine gun attacks of extreme sports silliness, like thousands of tiny little moronic films about a millisecond long strung together.

It's impossible to find even the smallest redeeming virtue in that even Rebecca Romijn Stamos is wasted--and she's absolutely wonderfully gorgeous, they managed to screw that up too.

Rollerball was well worth remaking in that it's an intriguing concept and a reinterpretation would be welcome, but this was an embarrassing effort--the worst directing since my six year old nephew wandered around the house with a video camera, and the worst writing since God was born.

Stay away from this bilge at all costs."
1794,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"Rollerball is without any doubt a bad movie. Especially getting through the first 30 - 45 minutes will strain ones patience (and taste). It gets somewhat better when Jonathan tries to escape - here (or rather in the aftermath of the attempt) at least some effort is made to give the audience a little inside into the characters.

Jean Reno is the only actor in this movie who can really act. Unfortunately he is not given much chance to do so - the only time he can really do something is once again the aftermath of the escape.

Eric Serra usually is a good sign (some people would disagree, but IMHO he has never turned out a bad score while composing several exceptionally good ones), but here it takes him a long time, to find the mood. The music in the first 30 minutes consists solely of rock music; only in the end one gets to hear the classic Serra drums and synths.

All in all I was expecting much worse after reading all the reviews - but nonetheless, all the time invested in making this film would have been better put somewhere else. (4/10)"
1795,Rollerball (2002),3.1,John McTiernan,"It is difficult to write this review, as the experience of viewing ""Rollerball"" has destroyed my ability to form complete thoughts and express myself using words and sentences. Perhaps this should be a warning to anyone that is thinking of going out and seeing this film, but I would have to say that this moviegoing experience has given me more respect for the craft of filmmaking. No matter how bad I thought any movie I had ever seen in the past was at the time, I now realize that the film projected onto the screen during those viewings could have been replaced by the film under the heading ""Rollerball"". I now have more respect for anyone who did not, in anyway, participate in the making of this film. I also have more respect for films that did not fail in the ways

Watching this movie approximates doing acid. If you have never done acid, and do not wish to try, you can watch this movie to assimilate the effects that the substance does to the human brain.

RollerBall is a game that takes place in the future...way, way in the future...all the way in the year 2005. Chris Klein plays Jonathan Cross, or, as his many fans in Southeast Asia would refer to him, ""Jon-a-ton"". Jonathan was at one time considered to be the ""Next Wayne Gretsky"", which I find to be quite incredible since he had refused to play professional hockey LL Cool J plays Marcus Ridley Jean Reno plays the villain, Petrovich Rebecca Romijn-Stamos plays the part of Aurora, or as the fans know her, the ""Black Widow"" Half the time, there was never a ball in place. Another amazing fact is that there never was a score shown.

I think this movie has the greatest example of unintentional Dadaist scriptwriting that has ever been done. This film was a fantastic combination of nonsensical dialogue, pl

I think everyone that has any respect for the craft of filmmaking should go see this movie as soon as possible. Note that, only two weeks after the film was originally released wide into several thousand theaters, it is nearly impossible to find a theater that is still showing this film. I found that there were only two showings of this film in the entire city of Indianapolis that could be viewed. At one theater, it only played at 4 o'clock, while we see it at a different theater, where there was only one 9 o'clock showing. If you don't see this film now, you may have to wait until the film comes out on video, which would be a complete travesty. The full experience of realizing the horror of this travesty can only truly come to life on the big screen, and any disgust this movie would cause watched in the context of a 20-odd inch screen would be filtered. You owe it to yourself to see how corrupt and ill-managed the Hollywood system truly is, and you must realize that a film this horrendous was made to go on the big screen. This garbage was made with the idea that it would gross more than it cost to make, which was, quite embarassingly, an excess of 80 million dollars. Think about it. 80 million dollars. An amount of money that could have been used to build a much larger studio at MGM. An amount of money that could have been used to finance 80 small 1-million dollar budget films based on good independently written screenplays. Heck, an amount that would be much better given to charities to feed hungry people. Do you have any idea how many people 80 million dollars could feed? The fact that this mass of money, the majority of which will never be made back and is simply gone forever, was used for the soul purpose to create ""Rollerball"" sets a new low for the studio system. The very fact that producers at MGM thought that mainstream audiences would go for this trash makes me pessimistic in the Hollywood system, while the fact that audiences were smart enough to stay away from it gives me optimistic for the integrity of humanity. There is no reason for this film to exist. The fact that a major film studio would spend so much money on a film this bad shows that there is something wrong with the way the system works now.

The acting was terrible, the script was horrendous, seriously. A group of high school kids in drama club could do better. It was deathly boring, i thought I was in there for more than three hours.

Worst of all is the message its trying to send. Isn't it curious that the movie tried so hard to portray all of those that were left as bad messed up people? So is that supposed to mean that those who don't believe in the Christian God are all either cheaters, flirts, gamblers, thieves, drug addicts and just generally messed up? Because that's what I saw. Don't think I wouldn't catch that. I get that its a Christian movie but its still a pretty offensive way of showing off your faith.

As demonstrated the featured review, the only people who will like this dog are those who take a creepy satisfaction in their belief that they alone will get sucked up to heaven while everybody else fries in hell.

As a result, it's aimed at a narrow audience of knee-jerk true believers who would like it no matter how awful it is.

And this was awful, folks. The script falls so flat I even lost my taste for popcorn. Even my daughter, who wanted to see it, got bored pretty quickly.

So when some other people walked out, we 'left behind' them."
1804,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"Once again I was deceived by the trailers as they made this movie look absolutely amazing; however, the trailers were the only good things that came out of this movie, and that says a lot.

First of all, we have the common Christian movie stereotype where some of a family is for God, and some of it is against God. Than we are provided with the frequent misunderstandings non-Christians face regarding the meaning of scripture due to Christians who have almost 0 theological education. So because the Christians fail to provide an adequate answer, the non-Christian lashes out. At least provide the audience with some level of complexity if you're going to have some kind of a theological debate. Your audience understands more than you think. Now if we could simply ignore the horrendous script not to mention the awful acting, we still have a movie full of stereotypes regarding non-Christians, Christians, Muslisms and even smaller people (just trying to be politically correct) which got old very fast.

But believe it or not, this is not even the worst part of the movie! The worst part is the terrible background music! To put it bluntly, it was GARBAGE!! It was so floaty and totally ruined the atmosphere. Now don't get me wrong, some movies require floaty music, but it would have made more sense to have music that was thematically apocalyptic. For example, Armageddon, Independence Day, or World War Z each had excellent pieces which blend perfectly into the atmosphere of the movie. The fact is even if the script to a movie is mediocre, having an excellent soundtrack can drastically improve the atmosphere. With a corny 80's saxaphone piece playing in the background, or cheesy orchestral music, which sounded digital, my wife and I walked out of the movie going ""what did we just see?""

I have no idea why we continued to watch, it was insulting and base when it came to the end. The beginning starts with the lead female getting to up in Christian grills. It was a bit unnecessary, but it serves as a HA! Told you so moment at the end when it turned out that this was a rapture film. Which is not bad, but there is just nothing to it.

The performances are, at best, distracted as is the direction. Even the actors seem unconvinced. I'm still kicking myself for watching this film. Sin and purity are depicted with juvenile simplicity. Religious bias is arrogantly displayed (but I'll leave that to the unfortunate viewer to spot). Complex ideas like forgiveness, atonement and judgement are reduced to idiocy at an atomic level.

Too much emphasis is placed on the religious aspects of this story making it feel like a veritable propaganda flick, ruining all chances of immersing in the story-line.

Unfortunately, this caused spirited daughter Chloe, as well as her pilot husband Ray, to drift apart from her. When Chloe comes home to surprise her father for his birthday, he was called to fly a plane from New York to London, among his other ulterior motives. That same day, a distressing event occurs where millions of people simultaneously suddenly disappear, leaving their clothes and things behind. Those people left behind scramble to make sense of what happens, as Ray struggles to land his damaged plane safely back to New York.

Academy Award winner Nicholas Cage once again majorly disappoints with his hammy and florid performance in this film as Ray here. He had a moment in the end where some genuine emotion came through, but it felt too late and too brief. It was good to see '80s sweetheart Lea Thompson back on the big screen again as Irene, but she was barely there. Cassi Thompson did her best to carry the film on the ground as Chloe, but her efforts were negated by the lines she was made to say and the stunts she was made to do.

When the passengers were boarding the plane, I felt like I was watching a cheesy episode of the ""Love Boat"". Of course, there was going to be a sexy and flirtatious stewardess Hattie (Nicki Whelan). There was a hotshot TV journalist Buck Williams (so this is what Chad Michael Murray is up to nowadays), a Moslem guy, an angry midget guy, a sleazy businessman, a nerdy Asian (!) conspiracy theorist, a nervous drug addict lady, an even more nervous gun-toting mother (Why did you accept this role, Jordin Sparks?). I guess you can see the chaotic over-the-top acting circus.

In fact, this whole film had an 70s-80s TV movie look and feel about it. Even the opening credits looked from that era. If ""The Remaining"" had a horror approach to depicting the Rapture, ""Left Behind"" played like a bad B-action film, down to its fiery, explosive, down-the-wire, narrow- escape type finale.

The Christian agenda was obvious from the start, and I did not mind that. In fact, I was looking forward to seeing how they would tie it into the story. However, even as a Christian film, I felt this film did not do its job well at all. Oddly, it made Christians appear unnaturally nutty or weird. Worst of all, its evangelical message was lost in the confusion and the cheese. 2/10."

Sigh - this is the 'mildest' - and I use this term VERY mildly - of the 3 iterations of a religiously - Christian, or, more, accurately, an American, paranoid, 'born-'again,' religious, extremist story.

Saying this does not prepare one for the over-the-head religiousness, and all the ickyness (hatred, paranoia, 'everything is OK, just as long as YOU think the 'right' way - 'OUR' way nonsense) possible.

Here's the EXTREMELY simplistic plot, from a VERY simplistic screenplay, based on an even-more simplistic story: all of the sudden, people - but, primarily, children (why? Well, as Christian doctoring espouses, they're 'innocent.' Right), but, others - mainly those, who are elderly, espouse a lot of 'come and pray with me, to Christ'-type nonsense.

'Lft behind?' Well, everyone else, including those on a plane piloted by Nicholas Cage (who I do like, and realise he appears in anything which sounds 'interesting,' and he gets paid to be in), and a plane full of 'non-believers,' which in this case, is so-so myopic; the Muslim, the angry, almost hello sh dwarf, and others.

Typical dialogue is the Muslim gets up and says 'we should pray,' to which the dwarf - his anger so visible, says, hostility 'pray? To who? Who's 'God?' The Muslim says 'allah,' and the dwarf seethes.

I was so uncomfortable by this point, because it IS the gathered running rampant - ESP. In the states, which IS at the root of MUCH of what problems are roiling the planet.

Without turning this 'movie review,' into a political and religious diatribe - which is next to impossible, due to this garbage's creator's toxicity, this film only serves one purpose; to fan the flames of hatred.

It is next-to-impossible for anyone other than a child, who doesn't (YET) have the 'us-or- them'-type thinking which makes such trash, unwatchable.

The only audience for such dreck is paranoiac, under-educated 'born-again,' American, religious lunatics, and before I leave, let me remind you; most wars fought during humanity's time on this planet have been fought over, in the 'name of' ONE thing; religion.

The problem with ALL region are people - trying to say 'mine's better than yours.'

Well, for those who have a belief in a 'higher power,' other than themselves, for those who find comfort in not having to take responsibility for ANYthing, so long as they can invoke 'god' in it, this bile's for them, and their 20+, 'home-skooled' offspring.

Anyone with a brain, save your money, and do ANYthing, watch ANYTHING BUT this dreck."

1824,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"Nicolas Cage made himself a household name in the 90s and early 2000s with various action roles and dramatic roles. This actor has started in some memorable roles that have drove him into the cinematic spotlight, but lately his filmography seems to have taken a downward slope, with a number of ill-fated roles. This apocalyptic thriller based on a best selling faith- based novel series by Jerry B. Jenkins is only another role to pull Cage deeper into his career trajectory. Directed by Vic Armstrong, this Christian thriller stars Nicolas Cage as Rayford Steele, an airplane pilot who is unexpectedly called into work on the day his daughter Chloe (played by Cassi Thomson) arrives home from college for his birthday, much to their disappointment. Chloe comes home to visit her religious mother (played by Lea Thompson) and little brother. After brushing off another one of her mother's religious testimonies, Chloe takes her little brother to the mall for a little brother-sister time. Suddenly within a blink of an eye, millions of people (including Chloe's brother) around the globe vanish leaving their clothes behind in an event known as The Rapture as described in the Bible. With the world plunged into darkness and chaos and Rayford's plane on low fuel, he, Chloe, and the remaining survivors fight to survive in the fateful event unknown to them.

Christian dramas are often subject to poor reviews by critics, mainly for their lazy production value and acting, and having seemingly nothing on their agenda than to shove their religious messages down your throat. I personally don't have much of a problem with Christian dramas since I'm a believer myself, along as they are good. This one is the very opposite of good. And this all starts with the horrendous acting by just about everyone in the cast, especially Nicolas Cage who serves as the main star. None of them are remotely convincing in their roles, particularly in the scene when Cassi Thomson watches everyone around disappear within a flash (literally) and her reaction is awfully calm for someone who just witness a significantly mysterious event. The worse matters from the writing which often comes to be laughable and redundant. After the first twenty minutes, viewers spend over an hour with the characters trying to figure out the vaguely explained event that those (mostly Christians) already know happens, and the scenes never land. The only possible redeemable scene may come from Cassi Thomson's character speaking to a lonesome man at a Church who discusses about asking God for forgiveness of our sins, something mentioned in the bible multiple times. The rest of the film ponders through non-stop choppiness and even worse, it spends almost no effort on delivering its holy message. Instead, it focuses on the survival of these airplane passengers which quickly grows tiresome before the first hour.

Left Behind is thoroughly incompetent thriller with poor writing, poor acting, and an overall thin direction by Vic Armstrong. This film is completely soulless and empty in entertainment, even for those who are devote Christians, though those who enjoy religious themes may come to ignore the lazy production value. It is just sad to see an actor like Nicolas Cage in such a lifeless role, especially during this time in his career."

The first Left Behind movie, starring Kirk Cameron and based off of the same book series as this one, was bad but the bar was also pretty low on it. This one has a bigger budget and bigger stars but somehow manages to be much, much worse. As with the first movie, the plot is going to turn away some viewers immediately. I didn't really have an issue with the premise since I knew what it was about and nobody tricked me into seeing it. What I do have issues with is the lack of quality on this thing from top to bottom. The writing and directing are among the worst I've ever seen in a movie with an eight-figure budget. The special effects are very unimpressive; about what you might expect from a made-for-TV movie, not a theatrical release. The worst part of the whole thing is the acting. Every single actor in this is terrible. I've come to expect a certain degree of terrible from Nic Cage but he really takes it to another level here. A lot of the younger actors I'm barely familiar with but, after seeing them here, I will make sure to avoid anything they're attached to in the future. Probably the saddest part for me was seeing Lea Thompson in this. Why, Lea? Is this a religious thing I'm not aware of or what? You are better than this dreck. We're ALL better than this!"

You see, I'm on a bit of an apocalyptic kick considering the subject is less depressing than the tragedy that is the United States right now, under the tangerine idiot. Anyway, the whole reason I did was that I was under the impression it was going to be like a Twilight Zone-type movie, and with someone like Nicholas Cage in it, I figured it couldn't be horrendous. I'm surprised I got as far into it as I did, although after working for more than half a decade in a contact centre, my patience level is pretty high. The story is crap, the writing is crap, the acting is crap, and if this is the kind of crapola Nick Cage is taking on, he should retire forever. Lea Thompson could have made it the rest of her life on Lorraine McFly money without doing this piece of trash. I didn't pay anything other than my subscription to Netflix for this, but somehow I feel utterly raped of my time and actually feel slightly dumber than I was, and should be monetarily compensated for my loss. At least this ""film"" did help me understand one thing. This is the reason Trump is president. It now makes more sense to me that people actually put him into the position of power, now that I know that people actually created this and worse, people actually watched and enjoyed it.

1836,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"Let me first say that I am a Christian. I watch campy Christian movies solely for the sake to have some wholesome entertainment. I clearly remember the impact of reading the Left Behind book almost 16 years ago as a boy in middle school. Few other books have had such a profound impact on my life so I hold the entire series close to heart.

However, I share all this to say that this movie is nothing but a hot mess. Here's a short list of sins. 1.) A soundtrack that sounds like bad elevator music 2.) Maybe it was just my theater but the dialogue was also difficult to hear 3.) Casually calm characters on the airplane after one of the most horrifying events known to mankind has just occurred 4.) Out of place comedic relief and 5.) So-so acting.

To be fair though, there were some improvements from the original movie. The rapture scene was markedly improved and actually made me gasp because it truly occurs unexpectedly. The action shots were also much better and the acting was improved but for the star power involved was rather weak. Many of the airplane scenes felt overly contrived with stilted acting.

The movie doesn't necessarily follow the plot of the Left Behind book as it's merely inspired by it but it doesn't matter with all the aforementioned problems. There's also a lot less preaching in this film than the original but frankly could have used more as to convey some message of inspiration.

If you're a fan of the Left Behind series I wouldn't say completely disregard this film but please don't have high expectations that this movie will deliver and improve on the original. I've waited 16 years for a movie to convey the fear, excitement, and triumph that enthralled me when I was an 11 year old boy staying up to the wee hours of the morning trying to read just one more page of the book. After watching this movie, it looks like I'll have to wait for another remake."

I would rate this movie a 7/10 because it had all around solid acting, some funny parts, a moral message, and entertained me. Sure there are some parts that are a bit cheesy, but that's to expect in a Nicolas Cage movie. The plot is basically out of nowhere, the ""rapture"" occurs and God takes those up to Heaven that he feels need to go. I personally thought it was quite interesting, but not astounding.

Here's the thing: It's decently casted (Cage of course being the lone big name, and sadly he delivers a performance sub-par his other movies), fairly (if mostly over)-acted, well shot, good choice of locations and good FX... but... on the other hand, what drags this thing down to ground level is that corniness of the plot and script, the odd musical choices, the deep hollowness under the the otherwise OK acting, and its boilerplate predictability. I scratch my head at how they could make this last 2 hours. And that Speed2-esque scene.... I'm sitting here with a frozen shot-eating grin on my face.

I don't mind a flick with a religious theme, as it is can provide a fresh breath of air from a cinematographic space that is increasingly being filled with movies made from the usual overused trope elements.

A film so devastating, in fact genuinely unbearable in its overwhelming awfulness you question your faith in movies. How was $16 million allocated to this? Most of it most likely went to Nicholas Cage. Nicholas Cage is a good actor, but he needs to fire his agent. It's worse than usual here. Rather than doing one of his famous maniacal performances, he phones it in and nearly puts you to sleep. The plot isn't even paper thin: People disappear and it's something to do with religion. This is supposed to be a Christian movie, but it really isn't. The religious aspects are poorly handled and the religious characters are all presented as crazy and delusional. The only good thing that can be said about this mind blowing awful plane wreck of a movie is that the finale is admittedly tense and there's finally some sort of emotional investment in what should have been Direct to DVD. Sadly, just when you think it's finally over, they set it up for a sequel. Cue face palming.

The direction is utterly terrible and boasts no artistic merit of imagination. The acting is painful to watch and is so bad it feels like parody. It's not even unintentionally hilarious. There's little to no plot, the screenplay is painfully underwritten and lacks anything to actually attract the audience's attention. It's a terrible movie. I've run out of ways to further hammer home that point. Just don't watch it no matter what you do. Why should people waste their time on this? Even if you aren't spared from this highly unpleasant trip down the cinematic toilet bowl, don't watch the planned sequels. They'll most likely be just as awful.

When I realised it wasn't a joke and that the rest of the movie was going to be this bad, I considered slashing my own throat for the sake of my sanity, then remembered that I just had to stop watching! I'm not God-Squad myself, but surely even people who are easily led can see what a steaming pile of excrement this movie is and yet it has positive reviews! Surely nobody with a conscience, could make a movie this awful thinking it was a valid use of time and resources... and yet they did? Why? Perhaps the Devil is real after all... Muhahahahahaha."
1870,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"This movie was God-awful. Get it? God-awful.

I walked out on it, it was that bad. Figured that was better option than the alternative, which was suicide in my theatre seat, which is a sin (the suicide part that is, not the theatre seat location).

I haven't read the book(s) but that shouldn't matter, a movie should be able to stand on its own. I had a hunch walking in to an agenda-driven movie like this I was in for a bad time but had no idea just how bad. It's like they didn't even try to make it decent or watchable - their motto must have been ""just stick to the agenda, folks, and suck in all those sucker's monies.""

Stay home and watch Seth Rogen's/James Franco's ""This Is the End,"" a much more entertaining version of the rapture (although you'll probably burn in hades for that too...)"

1872,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"This is my first ever review but i just really felt that it needed to be said. This movie is horrible, don't watch it. Ever. Don't even think about it. The acting is so bad at some points I even find myself laughing. The script is flat and the movie takes way too long to build up. Now I'm not a believer but I usually don't mind movies with a religious theme at least not as long as they're GOOD and actually brings something more but this movie did not. I'm not ashamed to say I actually got of the couch and the others, still hoping it might get better, were left behind(see what I did there, that's the only joke I can make from this movie, seriously). I officially gave up, have never done that before, I can usually find something that is at least a little bit interesting to keep me through even the worst of movies, may it be a characters personality or just a really good looking actor but this movie didn't even bring that, not that there weren't some people I wouldn't mind looking at for a bit more but I just couldn't take it anymore. The best part about the movie is that I didn't pay for it.(Thank God for rental(yes i did manage a second, awful joke, I'm gonna stop I promise)). Already a few minutes in I could see the cliché ending, no twists, no turns and as the world went wild when people disappeared I realized I was right and just gave up.

So please, no matter your reason to consider this movie, put it back! Put it back in whatever awful little box you found it in and let it be left behind(sorry). Leave it, forget it and don't ever go back to it. Not even if you're Christian. I'm serious, it's not worth it."
1873,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"This movie is so bad it will probably be famous from be listed on top of a lot of turkey lists.

The acting is terrible, only hire $1 actors is the trick apparently but they could have acted better if the script was better but it's horrible, the dialog is dug up from the 80's. But why didn't they hire an acting coach at least, looks like they got Nicolas to do that job too.

The plot is half way stolen from a bunch of other movies like The Langoliers and Flightplan but it's like they heard the script from a drunk guy, wrote it down on a napkin, dropped it in the toilet and then tried to put it all together to a full length movie.

Lots of bloopers too :) The main broad that Nick is dating has different make up all through the movie.

But one positive note..or should I say Consistent note is that Nicholas Cage finally has a cast of his own caliber. They all suck!"
1874,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"Morbid curiosity mightn't have gotten me to watch this movie, and 2% of a rotten tomato could not have gotten me there, but my sincerely held belief that the world is better than this, contrasted with the fact that it's now making a profit, tipped my interest. If it tipped it only to the point where I could find a way to watch it without paying for it, you'll have to forgive me.

The elephant in the room, of course, is Nicholas Cage. I'd love to know more about him, but won't pretend to, and can't speculate, since I respect him too much.

Objectively, even if it were a SyFy Channel project (and I defend the channel's efforts always!), I'd be shocked that it made it to the air. I'd hoped there might at least be a sharknado type of fun to it. But it's in theater's, making real money. I have so many questions, of authors, of actors, of producers, of ticket-buyers.

If this isn't technically a ""review"", again, you'll have to forgive me. It's a wretch of a movie, but further, it's a depressing artifact of our times. The End Times, one might say, when Nicholas Cage reprises a Kirk Cameron vehicle."

I wonder why Nicolas Cage agreed to make this, must be really desperate. and a very lousy soundtrack, the whole film looks like a very bad 90s B film.

the lead heroine who's Nic Cage's character's daughter just keeps running aimlessly throughout the film with dramatic clichéd tearful eyes. dialog about righteousness with that annoying background music was beyond boring. the single fact that this film made it to the big screen is a mystery to me. avoid it for your own good, watch Annabelle instead, a very solid Horror film released the same day as this drive"

1878,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"I realize that my experience of the film is thoroughly determined both by its premise and the execrable horror that believers in the Rapture present to us. In any event, as I watched it I realized how much many fundamentalist Christians -- those who can write a review here of this film as about ""something that is very exciting to Christian believers"" -- and ISIS have in common. ISIS apparently believes in dishing out heavenly ordained atrocities themselves, and by their actions acquire additional holiness. Rapture fantasists -- of course posturing innocence by claiming they will be only witnesses of a cataclysm that bears no wishful content on their part -- hope that their god will dish out those atrocities and through their belief in the Rapture they will acquire additional holiness, along with the aforesaid excitement. In both cases we confront a kind of sanctioned sadism that is simply repellent and thoroughly *unexciting,* dismaying. Rapture fantasists only disagree with ISIS about who should die and under what auspices. These thoughts sorta got in the way of appreciating anything else about the film.

Compared to this stuff, other apocalyptic films, like Day After Tomorrow, seem downright upbeat. You can get your thrills from megadeaths, and then interpret the film as inspiring a change in social practices. Not so here."
1879,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"If there were a rapture surely more would be taken up. This just shows how judgmental religion and religious people are. People should be able to make mistakes and live morally but not religiously without being judged bad people.

So many mothers shown on the movie having lost their children but surely not all of the mothers were sinful. Teenagers are not old enough and mentally developed to be held so responsible that they are deemed bad. Look at all the police and paramedics who were left behind and continued to do their jobs helping people!

1882,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"I can't really begin to explain how bad this was. I'm struggling to understand how Cage ever got involved with this, it's not as if he needs the money(unless the subscriptions to Scientology have drastically increased). Painfully slow beginning, what was the point of the dreadful background music which seemed to accompany every scene? It meandered through the middle without ever really revealing any meaning as to what was occurring down on the surface. The end,when it finally came,was by far the best part of the movie as it took us to the credits,which were more interesting than the plot. Avoid like the plague - you have been war"
1883,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"First of all, full disclosure: I'm not a believer in the whole Rapture thing. Still, I'm willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of a movie. After all, I don't believe in hobbits, vampires, witches, The Force, etc, either. The truth is, though, I think I would hated this movie even *more* if I'd been a believer.

Let's face it, The Rapture is the ultimate middle finger to nonbelievers; the final ""We told you so!"", so it's strange that the movie puts religion in the back seat. The couple of overtly Christian characters are mealy mouthed and annoying, and we're kind of relieved when they're gone. The other ""Christians"" are pretty covert. For example, a stewardess seems more than happy to gossip with another about the latter's upcoming sexual tryst, without the need to lecture her on her behavior. It's only later, when we find ""Bible Study"" in ridiculously large block letters in her (by then abandoned) calendar that we learn the truth. If she'd kept her schedule on an iPhone, we might never have known.

Basically, the Rapture is just a vehicle for an action movie - a really, really lame action movie. The entire movie focuses on the fate of airline captain Rayford Steele and his plane, which I understand is just one part of the book. The central problem is that as long as one able-bodied pilot is left, The Rapture would really be more of an inconvenience than an emergency for a plane in flight. They get around this by throwing various obstacles in his path to build tension. These range from contrived to comically contrived, and in the end you've got something along the lines of an unfunny version of ""Airplane!"". I kept expecting Leslie Nielsen to come in and say ""We're all counting on you"".

Of course, the biggest disappointment is Cage himself. Nicholas Cage is a talented actor who is famous for taking absolutely any role to pay down his enormous debts. Still, even in the worst movies, he usually fully commits to the part, and you at least get some campy fun. The godawful remake of ""Wicker Man"" comes immediately to mind as a good example. If ever there was an excuse for his trademark histrionics, this is it, but his just mumbles through his lines, with the look of embarrassment never entirely leaving his face. He really looks like a man who's seriously questioning the choices that have led him to this - not in the movie, but in his actual life.

Not good, not ""so bad it's good"". Just a couple hours I'll never get back."

Nicolas Cage does his best, and the supporting cast is strong, with performers like Lea Thompson and Cassie Thompson, who are very appealing. The actors do the best they can with moronic dialogue and unsubtle and vile stereotypes: for example, the well-meaning Muslim and the defensive ""little person.""

Yes .. A complete disas"
1888,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"As a non-fundamentalist Christian, I remember when the Tim LaHaye book (on which this is based) came about. It stirred a lot of excitement in those fundamentalist circles. I was never especially interested in it; never read it. To be honest I wasn't especially interested in the movie either (and never watched the earlier Kirk Cameron version.) But - hey - it's on Netflix; I had a free afternoon. How bad could it really be? Well, pretty bad. It isn't as awful as some people say it is. To be honest, the actual moment of rapture was kind of well done. People's clothes just dropping to the ground as they disappear leaving everybody else with either mouths agape or screaming in terror. It was kind of cool. And it's true that millions of people (whether Christians or anyone else) just simply disappearing all at the same time would cause chaos around the world - although we didn't see much of the world. Just a bit of New York City and mostly the airplane.

You see, most of this movie is set on an airplane. Nicolas Cage plays the pilot - Captain Ray Steele (which is a kind of a cool name - kudos to LaHaye for coming up with it in the novel.) The Steele family is divided. Ray and his daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson) are non- believers (Ray's having an affair with a flight attendant played by Nicky Whelan), while Irene (mom) and Raymie (young son) must be believers - 'cause they get taken to heaven, meaning we don't see much of them. I thought the scenes on the plane were semi- believable at times. Passengers had a variety of reactions - aliens or time travel or conspiracy or whatever. There were times of panic - although by the end everybody seemed surprisingly calm. There's a wee bit of suspense as the plane approaches New York City with no fuel. But overall the story and characters were pretty weak.

As for the theology, or at least the moral message? Well, first of all all children go to heaven. Because we get told that there are no children left. No age was attached. Do you get a free pass to heaven until you're - 10? 13? 16? I don't know. And, boy, once those Christians are gone it turns out that most of those who are left are looters or related thug-like folks, because there's lots of looting. And most of the Christians who were portrayed before the rapture were of the - shall we say - extremist variety, so this is clearly a triumphalistic sort of message from the fundamentalist community - come over to our side because we're gonna win! And there was really no great attempt to explain the idea of the rapture. It's not an idea that's universally accepted among Christians, and it's really a kind of bizarre idea. This is obviously supposed to be a sort of religious propaganda; an evangelistic tool meant to unfortunately scare people into believing that they better believe or this terrible thing is going to happen and you're gonna be ""left behind."" But scaring people into faith rarely works in my experience, and if it does it calls into serious question the very reason why a person would believe. The Christian faith as I understand it is supposed to put the focus on caring for others; this kind of evangelism tells you that you should be worried about yourself. And there's that irritating song that closed the movie out that I hadn't heard in years. ""I wish we'd all been ready. ... The Son has come, and you've been left behind.""

This isn't as absolutely horrible as some people say it is - although I wouldn't have objected to being raptured during it. I could have seen that as an act of divine mercy. Of course, I wasn't raptured during it, but I will confess that I fell asleep and missed the last 20 minutes of it - but I was interested enough to go back and see how it ended. Everything's kind of left up in the air - maybe leaving open the possibility of a sequel, since there have been Lord knows how many books in the series. I doubt that will happen. I would think this has a very niche market. Fundamentalist Christians might yearn for more. Others (like me) might check it out on Netflix, but I certainly wouldn't pay to see a sequel in a theatre or specifically rent a DVD of a sequel. (3/10)"

1890,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I've committed many immoral acts of evil during my time on this bountiful land you have *apparently* created for us. Supporting atheism. Embracing homosexuality. Becoming a pathological liar. Hell, excuse my blasphemy, I've even stolen a deck of 'Yu-Gi-Oh' cards when I was a child. Not proud of that one! Suffice to say, my soul is as ""Dirrty"" as Christina Aguilera. But my biggest sin is one I've committed recently. In fact, to be specific, last night. I bravely watched Left Behind. A piece of Christian propaganda where the world experiences a biblical rapture and everyone is running around losing their ""God damn honey!"". And, without coming across as insensitive, oh my God it's worse than attending Sunday Service!

Sensationalist propaganda that ham-fists Christian revelatory views upon its audience with atrocious acting, inexcusable writing and misplaced direction. Cage is a pilot. ""See my badge?"". And he doesn't care. Because when the screenplay insists on having a couple of delusional characters preach Christian teachings at every possible opportunity, that's what God wanted apparently, I don't blame him. This rapturous apocalypse drives everyone crazy. Civilians purposefully stealing things to highlight how sinful they are. Even driving our protagonist to attempt suicide. The world is manic, and it's ""God's"" fault. But it's fine. Honestly! Armstrong depicts our beloved deity as a beacon of generosity. What he/she/it/I don't care has bestowed upon this persecuted land is a blessing. Because, y'know, we weren't Cher and we didn't ""Believe"" (auto-tune included...), so why do we deserve to be saved?

Urgh, this got too deep for a review. Keeping it short and sweet, it's one of the worst films I've endured.

1907,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"**Spoilers**

Now obviously everyone has reviewed this saying how terrible it is. So I thought I would start picking holes in the aviation side of things. In no particular order (and ones i can remember)

1. Captain leaving the flight deck without really talking to the F/O, no handover of control.

2. Captain returns to the flight deck using emergency flight deck access code. This does not unlock the door immediately.

3. Why is the aircraft in an unusual attitude? At that altitude the aircraft would be on autopilot, not manual flight. So without either pilot on the flightdeck it would continue straight and level and the current speed until the fuel ran out.

4. Non-Standard unusual attitude recovery (disregarding the fact it wouldn't get into one)

5. TCAS with the other aircraft. Capt failed to follow the TCAS resolution advisory which would have guaranteed minimum separation between the 2 aircraft.

6. With that substitutional damage on the aircraft wing there would be an incredible amount of airframe vibration.

7. wing was damaged, why does he lose elevator control?

8. At point of divert JFK would not be the best airport to divert too. The great circle route between JFK and London would take you up the coast of Canada then passing just south of greenland. Most likely airport which could take an aircraft at that size would likely be Gander or similar.

9. Changing aircraft type throughout the film.

10. A lot of none-standard Radio Transmissions 10.1 using names on RT 10.2 Maydays are initiated by saying mayday 3 times 10.3 after declaring a mayday your normal callsign is preceded by mayday 10.4 all radio communication involves your callsign to identify who is talking and who you are talking too. 10.5 all attempts to contact were on VHF radio, no attempt made on HF? 10.6 while trying to make mayday he was selected on 121.9 (not a standard oceanic frequency) and while changing the dial he never actually made it active frequency so was always transmitting on 121.9 10.7 if you failed to contact anyone on a atc frequency a pilot would likely try 121.5 (guard) or 123.45 (aircraft to aircraft)

11. Failure of flight controls would make the autopilot unusable. However he seems to continue using it (though seemingly from other parts of the film there is no continuity regarding the autopilot)

12. Fuel situation, at the start of the flight the Capt says it will be a 6.5 hour flight, taking into account reserves and alternate fuel it is likely to be a conservative fuel for about 8.5-9 hours. However, he has a major fuel leak at the 3 hour mark which would probably cost him more than any reserves he had yet they somehow manage to fly 3 hours return back to JFK.

13. Sat phone problem (not strictly aviation but bear with me). Continually failing to contact on sat phone is a problem, but there is another service provided by Stockholm radio (HF, so would work in the middle of the Atlantic) which allows you to call a any phone in the world.

14. Ups the cabin altitude to force people to put on masks, this is possible but wouldn't happen as quickly as shown.

15.claims to be flying a 400 tonne aircraft. seems very heavy for aircraft shown in the film. (for reference, Max Takeof weights for A330: 242 tonnes: B757 255 tonnes: B777: 380 tonnes)

16. landing a ""400 tonne"" aircraft without flaps, spoilers, etc. is not possible, would be looking at at least 2-3miles minimum

17. Wing magically repairs itself

18. with no engines you would have no hydraulic pressure, would have to be a manual gear extension which he didn't do

19. wouldn't be able to lift the wing again once on the ground. it wouldn't provide enough lifting moment

20. evacuating the pane. as soon the door opened the slide would inflate. wouldn't have to push it out afterwards.

21. aircraft evacuation slides are very hard and don't give you any bounce as demonstrated when the guy was kicked off the plane.

22. very low quota of cabin crew for the size of the aircraft. rule is 1 per 50 passengers minimum.

23. when evacuation is undertaken, general rule is get away from the aircraft. not mill about near the burning wreckage.

Overall this film was terrible. I am sure i missed a few holes in the aviation side too but this made it slightly more amusing for me while watching.

Source of knowledge about the holes in the aviation parts, I am a commercial Pilot."
1908,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"After the hugely entertaining deriding it received from critics and audiences upon release over in the USA, I was absolutely awaiting Left Behind's release on Australian shores with bated breath as it sounded like one of those hilariously bad movies that lends itself to a watching purely on the basis that it's like watching a train wreck you can't turn away from. After now watching this atrocious excuse for a feature length film it's undoubtedly a movie as bad as its reputation suggests yet also a film that I found completely and utterly boring, a movie therefore that can't even be recommend as a so bad it's good watch.

In keeping with the faith based themes on offer here in the adaptation of Jerry B. Jenkins and Tim LaHaye's hugely popular novel of the same name, the biggest movie sin a film can commit is that of boredom and my goodness does Vic (Indiana Jones's stunt double) Armstrong's film deliver the ultimate sin en masse. It's truly hard to explain just how dull and intently lacking in spark this film is. From the films downright cheesy opening segments set in an airport through to its staging of high stakes life and death on a plane in the sky, Left Behind quite literally never even gets on the runway, let alone takes off. What's most confusing about this sleep inducing event is that it cost around 16 million dollars to make, where did this money go? Absolutely not on special effects or locations (the whole film feels as though it's set in one part of plane) and not on actors, unless Mr. Cage charged an exuberant fee in another one of his incredibly bad movie roles.

Not sure if we'll ever now see the end of Cage's tax woes, Cage here as flirtatious U2 loving pilot Rayford Steele can't even summon up the looney energy he is known for to save Left Behind in any way shape or form. Looking like he can barely muster the energy to utter his lines Cage is a ghostly presence in a cast of horribly out of sort's actors. From one time teenage girl crush Chad Michael Murray through to Cassi Thomson and Nicky Whelan's eye candy females, Left Behind must surely contain one of 2014's most lacklustre ensembles who more than likely started to realise what a mistake they had made by signing on for this project from day one.

Left Behind is sadly not as bad as you'd hoped in that the most predominant thing it displays is an uncanny knack to deliver everything including the end of the world as we know it in such an incredibly boring way. There's no real memorably horrible dialogue, no ranting and raving Nic Cage and just generally nothing at all that suggests this movie will even be a cult favourite of those among us that crave the very worst of cinema. This ladies and gentleman, is the end of the world as boring as we could ever know it.

1909,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"The movie just don't know what it want's to be about... Is it action??? Is it sci-fi??? Is it mystery??? Is it religious??? I really don't know! Is it awful? Yes!!! Does it have no meaning what's so ever throw out almost all the movie? Yes!!! Try's it to convert you in to being a good Christian??? Hell yes!!! Be ware of the rapture!!! As the movie goes on, one thing is clear: it tends to be more religious and this really sucks!!! If I wanted religion in my life, I would go to church. But what I hate the most is when i'm thinking I'm gonna see an action movie but it turns out to be a try of converting me to Christianity!!! I really want my money and the 2 hours wasted of my life back!!! P.S. I want to stay clear with the actors: The acting is good, but guys...the movie just stings!!!!!!"
1910,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"I've seen this crap a million times over. This movie perfectly portrays what a lot of christians think of non believers or followers of a different faith. It also very clearly shows that it wouldn't matter if you're a good person or not. As long as you don't believe in ""christ"" or ""god"" you're screwed. It basically shows you the essence of Christianity.

Either you're with us or you're against us. - Good enough or not good enough - Obey a mass murdering god or burn in hell


Good intentions or not. This movie shows an ego that is out of this world and stinks right up to the ""high heavens"". I'm not even going to bring up the acting etc etc etc. It's like bread but without the sugar and / or salt. But I doubt it could get any worse than the message of the movie itsel"
1911,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"Well I went and saw the Left Behind movie last night. First of all I go with the pre wrath stance rather than pre trib. But hoping the pre tribbers have it right. Im not dogmatic about this because no matter what anyone thinks or believes it will go down the way it goes down inspite of anyone's view. I think Nicholas Cage is a good actor and have enjoyed some of his movies as well. I for sure am not into the LaHaye/LaLonde/ books and have never read any of them. The movie in my opinion was a dude. I thought the original one with Kirk Cameron was a better movie. Yes there were some pretty cool effects blah,blah,blah. But zero mention of the gospel. Zero! So why did the Christians disappear of the earth? That was never truly explained outside of. ""They believed"". What did they believe? Yes it shows the pastor who got left behind and when the young girl who was missing half her family asked why he was still there? He simply stated he preached yada,yada,yada but he didn't really believe. Again believe in what? Yes we are told the world is going to get really, really bad now. But why. Nicholas Cages acting was just not very convincing. I like the actor who played Buck (the original Kirk Cameron part) as well as the actress that played Chloe.For once Christianity Today got it right they state ""Christian magazine Christianity Today heavily criticized the film, saying, ""Left Behind is not a Christian Movie, whatever 'Christian Movie' could even possibly mean. In fact, most Christians within the world of the movie—whether the street-preacher lady at the airport or Rayford Steele's wife—are portrayed as insistent, crazy, delusional, or at the very least just really annoying. They want churches to book whole theaters and take their congregations, want it to be a Youth Group event, want magazines like this one to publish Discussion Questions at the end of their reviews—want the system to churn churn away, all the while netting them cash, without ever having to have cared a shred about actual Christian belief. They want to trick you into caring about the movie. Don't. We tried to give the film zero stars, but our tech system won't allow it."" Myself Im waiting for the Daniel Project movie to come out. Im sure it will be a better film."

1913,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"The movie was portrayed as the book read for the most part. It got across the message that was intended to depict.

The characters were as expected based on how they were portrayed in the book.

I believe the rapture was portrayed very well particularly when the son was raptured. Won't go into details...goose bumps!

I have read several reviews that mention ""preachy""? Well what did you expect from a movie that is based on Christian Theology?

Did it have some ""Hollywood"" aspects to it, of course it is a Hollywood movie. Revealing dress and an emphasis on showing female shape as often as possible. That is what you get to draw a ""wide"" audience.

This is what I hope to be a first in a long line of movies that portray the books. It is just a set up for much more involved and intertwined relationships and hardship. Along with some portions that will need to have action packed parts.

I say to those who produced the film:

We are ready for the next one!

Bravo on this one.

1914,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"I am currently watching this movie and within 10 minutes I realized what I was watching was one of those typical badly written and terribly acted rapture movies. It's as if the budget only allowed a maximum of three takes per scene. There is nothing and I mean nothing that is memorable about this movie.

What I can not believe is the actors such as Nicholas Cage, Lea Thompson and others lent their names to this idiotic piece of trash.

It's not that it is a religious movie, it's that every one of these types of movies, that have the potential to be extremely good because of the subject matter are really stupid.

1918,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"The ""Left Behind"" series of books were written to dramatize what might happen during the last 7 years of human history as predicted in the Bible as it is understood by some Christians.

I have read them all and I saw all three of the original movies that started off with Kirk Cameron. Well, I only made it somewhat through the third movie because it was SO BAD.

The books and the movies are based on a bunch of nonsense and I STRONGLY suggest reading ""The Age of Reason"" by Thomas Paine instead. It is free online.

I thought, just for old times sake, I would watch this new version with Nicolas Cage. Wow.

Christian movies are notoriously Z grade level experiences. This one was Z minus. I can't say enough bad things about it. Cage must be broke to work on a stink bomb of this magnitude.

Here is the thing: the world is not going to end. Many preachers have predicted these things over and over and they NEVER happen. Even Jesus falsely predicted he would return within the lifetimes of his followers if you read what he actually said and not what some preacher tells you. It is never going to happen and there is nothing to be afraid of. Just live your life and worry about not being a jerk and getting to work on time."
1919,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,The only thing that made this movie worse was its ability to keep me watching it to the painful end. In the end I had a revelation of my own. I am now going to write my own movie. Its going to be about a homeless man that adopts a rabbit. Its setting is in Salt Lake City. It will be an intellectual film featuring witty conversations between the rabbit and the homeless person as they trek through the desert on their way to a surf competition in San Diego. Along the way the bunny must make enough money pan handling for the ex-pizza man turned homeless person to enter and win the surf competition so they can retire in Maui with the bunny's ex-spouse. Stay tuned
1920,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"It started great. good story, good characters... then the event happens and the movie suddenly becomes quite exciting.

If only they had just left the religious bullshit out of it, then it would have been a decent movie.

Too bad they had to bring superstition into a movie meant for a good science fiction story.

I went from being quite excited, to face-palming myself several times.

Too bad - note to screenwriters... leave religion OUT!

Usually I would write a long good review, but I am just so disappointed!"
1921,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"I didn't read much about the movie ahead of time, and I haven't paid much attention to the negative reviews. I'd rather make up my own mind about a movie. I can understand that people who were expecting another ""Christian Outreach"" movie may be disappointed, because I don't think that this version of Left Behind was supposed to be that sort of movie. Likewise, people who are expecting a movie that is ""by the book"" may also be disappointed since this movie doesn't even cover half of the first book. So, best to leave your expectations at home and go watch the movie without them. Left Behind is definitely character driven rather than special effects driven, and although the special effects in this movie were good (but not great), I more enjoyed watching the characters meet and learn about each other and develop genuine relationships in the middle of a very intense and scary situation. I walked out of the theater looking forward to watching the next movie as the rest of the story unfolds and the character relationships deepen. Oh, and I liked Chad Michael Murphy in the role of Cameron ""Buck"" Williams. He played it quite believably well (no offense intended to Kirk Cameron!) and was my favorite. The only actor I didn't quite get into so much was Nicky Whelan. Although she's a good actress, she just didn't quite seem to me to be a good fit for the role of Hattie Durham. She was definitely not on the same level as Nicolas Cage (Ray Steele) and Cassi Thomson (Chloe Steele), who both did a much better job and were much more believable. I enjoyed them both very much."
1922,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"I saw ""Left Behind"" because I have a strange hobby...to watch as many of the films as I can from IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list. This list consists of the 100 lowest rated mainstream releases. So, obviously this is for horrible films, and I assumed the movie was horrible. The problem is...it's not a bad movie at all! So why is it on the list? I have three theories. First, it's become very fashionable lately to hate Nicholas Cage. Two of his films (this one and the remake of ""Wicker Man"") are on this list...yet neither is a bad film....but folk love to talk about how rotten an actor he is. He was just fine in ""Left Behind"". Second, the film has a super-narrow appeal...to Evangelical Christians...in particular folks like Baptists, Church of God and other such denominations. Why? Because these churches tend to preach about the end times and the Rapture. Other denominations, such as Methodists, Lutherans and Catholics do not generally hold this doctrine. So, if folks who aren't brought up hearing about the Rapture see the film, they are probably more likely to dislike the plot. Finally, my other thought is perhaps some group of folks have flooded IMDB with scores of 1 (such as how 4chan has attacked a few films en masse). All I know is technically speaking, it's a decent production...not nearly earning the abysmal score of 3.1 it currently has.

The story centers on a particular family. The father (Cage) and daughter are not thrilled that the mother (Lea Thompson) has become a Bible-thumping Christian. However, they are shocked when Mom, other believing Christians and all the children instantly vanish....sending the world into total chaos. It's really bad for Cage, as he's piloting an airliner over the Atlantic when all this occurs.

Generally, the film kept me interested and was decent. A few things I didn't like were the ending where the plane made an emergency landing....you just have to see it to believe, I mean NOT believe it. Second, I thought the tiny man was a bit overplayed. Who is THAT hostile?? But apart from all that, a decent film....with decent production values and acting."

1924,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"I am a Nigerian man who lost his job as Group Head, Brand communications with Oceanic Bank International Plc., in 2012. So maybe my opinion does not matter at all. But it does to me and, to whoever seeks it regarding the matter.

The extent of my disappointment with the movies coming out of Hollywood most recently pertaining the following movies particularly is beyond expression. I feel, unrealistically that the people responsible for the movies I under discussion should be arrested and jailed for the audacity or professional ineptness at making such movies.

First off is ""Left Behind"" – the plot of the movie is so weak that I have never seen any actor made to look so stupid as Nicholas Cage did in it. Maybe that's because he is an actor with a repertoire of truly compelling, cohesive (seamless) and coherent movies. To now be seen in a movie where the opening dialog between the daughter of his character in the movie and the celebrity photo journalist were embarrassing to the extent that I actually went past that bit when I got home to continue watching the movie. Then, I had to go back and watch it again anyway for reference. It didn't sound as badly as it did the first time but the point was the shock of even having any issue with the dialog in a movie he was in – people like us choose our movies using actors, directors and studios, not genre."
1925,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"Instead of letting his wife convulse in skimpy outfits onstage to convince people into embracing Christianity, the pastor in question could have used the funds to make a movie on hindsight like what Stoney Lake Entertainment has done here.

For the uninitiated, Stoney Lake Entertainment is set up to produce faith-inspired films for the masses and their intention is to create a franchise for Left Behind which in turn is based on a series of popular books by Jerry B. Jenkins and Tim LaHaye. This is not the first time Left Behind is being made into a movie however, in actual fact it was originally done in the year 2000 and followed by two other sequels.

Lake's CEO Paul Lalonde co-wrote this remake that involved the biblical Rapture where faithful believers are taken up to heaven before the apocalyptic end of days. The narrative begins with the Steele family at the JFK airport. Father Ray Steele (Nicolas Cage) is an airline pilot who is struggling to keep both his marriage and children together while beginning an affair with a sultry air stewardess. His daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson) is upset by his father's absence and she also has problems understanding issues of God especially with her religiously inclined mother.

Within seconds of the opening credits, we are treated to a shot of a book called ""Acts of God"" and seconds later, a woman begins rambling about the end of the world to a supposedly famous TV reporter, Buck Williams (Chad Michael Murray). There isn't much subtlety to talk about and the frequent hackneyed writing and wooden performances worsen the viewing experience further.

The touted Rapture happens about an hour later. On the flight where Ray is piloting to London, dozens of passengers and all the children onboard just vanished, leaving behind fear and lots of head scratching. On the ground, the same strange occurrence happened. Chloe's younger brother mysteriously vanishes at the mall leaving behind his belongings. Petty crimes, looting and robberies starts happening everywhere. It is the end of the world people, so everyone just has the urge to commit crimes. That makes a lot of sense.

Because this is a character driven drama with good religious intentions, we are treated to more subplots and stock characters on the plane. For example, the obligatory Muslim passenger (who might be a terrorist), an annoying little man, a black woman who pulls out a gun out of nowhere, and a rich business man who suddenly develops concern for his estranged daughter; meanwhile, Chloe is playing Supergirl helping Daddy land his huge malfunctioning plane on a deserted highway. No worries though, Daddy has a helping hand as co- pilot- the handsome and attractive Chuck.

Technically, this US$16 million production is often hampered by poor visual effects, sloppy editing and laughingly, a weird 1980s look to the entire flick. The usually entertaining Nicolas Cage with his batshit crazy acting turns up pretty somber and underwhelming. Left Behind is a heavy-handed, preachy movie disguised as an apocalyptic action thriller. Even veteran stunt coordinator Vic Armstrong who helmed this project couldn't make this any better. This movie is best left for believers while the rest might prefer to sign up for bible study for a start."

1954,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"I have to confess that I bought this movie a bit on a whim and my purchase decision was mostly based on the fact that Nicolas Cage was in it. That was a mistake! I should have done a wee bit more research before wasting my money. I did not really have any hopes that it would be a great movie but I at least hoped that it would be a somewhat decent disaster / apocalypse movie. Sadly, it is nothing of the kind.

This time I have to side with the people trashing this movie, even the so called ""critics"" at Rotten Tomatoes. This is a bad movie. It could have been a half decent movie. The basic idea is perhaps not super original but it could have been made to work. However, it is simply loaded with religious bullshit. Once you filter out said bullshit, which is bloody difficult since you are more or less force feed it during most of the movie, there is really nothing left.

The behavior of people are bizarre to say the least. The dialogue is mostly nonsensical. The movies attempt at putting different and original characters, including an obnoxious dwarf, on the plane is feeble. The action and special effects are generally lousy and the attempts to put some thrill and drama into the landing of the plane is laughable. Come on, you see a plane coming, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that it has no pilot and is flying in a straight line. You are over the Atlantic, a minor course change would have done the job and there was plenty of time. But nooo, the idiot script writer had Cage fly in a straight line like a chicken race until it was too late. And do not get me started on the stupidity of having someone driving down a stretch of highway in a pickup truck knocking over plastic cones to ""clear it for landing"".

Bad acting, really terrible. Bad script. Bad effects. Bad story. I'd rather watch Ben Affleck in Gili than this.

Nothing in this movie was believable or looked real. It was obvious they were in a Hollywood set. The only thing that had a residue of humor was the little guy in the plane.

The only thing you got in the end, in this garbage (I can't help it call it that way) movie, is that people vanish in thin air and the only (idot) explanation is that ""god took them in heaven to protect them"". To protect them from what ? From IRS ? That's all you get, nothing else. no matter how long your patience might be. How Nicholas Cage, such a great actor, could agree to this awful script, is a mystery to me. I feel that I lost precious time to see this filth.

1963,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"""If you look hard enough you can see whatever it is that your looking for. You might have to ignore a lot of other things to do it, one of them might be the truth."" Chloe Steele (Thomson) is on her way home to see her mom when she sees her dad Rayford (Cage) at the airport. He tells her he is piloting a plane to London and the two argue. While flying, passengers vanish into thin air and everyone wants answers. Back on Earth the same thing is happening all over and no one knows why. First thing I have to say is that I have never seen the Kirk Cameron movies or read the books so I can't compare this to those. Also many of you know how I feel about Nicholas Cage so that will play a role in this review. I do have to admit this wasn't his worst movie and he didn't bug me as usual in this, but that is probably because he wasn't in it all that much. As for the movie itself, it was very cheesy and had the same aspects that most faith based movies do that bother me so much about them. When the rapture happens those that are believers will get called to heaven. After the good disappear it instantly becomes a free for all. Parents see their children vanish before their eyes and their first instinct is to start looting and take TV's and rob everyone they can. Movies like this have an unrealistic view of ""non- believers"" and that is why I am not a big fan of these faith based movies. Overall, all that said though this wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I'm not sure how fans of the original or the book series will like it though. I give it a C."

The directing, acting, writing (especially the writing), and production left me breathless as to how anyone could have seriously spent millions to make it. Even the SciFi channel can crank out something better given a weeks notice.

Most noteworthy of criticism would be the soundtrack.. quite possibly the WORST annoying assortment of canned post-modern evangelical music. It was like watching an episode of Dallas from the 1980's.

Nicholas Cage was either coaxed into signing his contract whilst consuming copious amounts of alcohol.. or he just simply doesn't care any more.

1968,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"To begin, I need to preface my review with this: I DO NOT believe in the pre-tribulation rapture theory. I believe in the mid-tribulation rapture, like the Bible actually speaks of. LEFT BEHIND, from the getgo, is founded on the idea that one day God will collect a bunch of people in Heaven, and everyone left on the planet is (sort of) screwed.

This film is a remake of the original film that starred Brad Johnson and Kirk Cameron. Whether this version is closer to the book or not is beyond me, for I own a copy but have not yet read it. The shocker in my viewing was that practically every bit of the film takes place on the plane where Buck Williams and Ray Steel are stranded after the rapture takes place and a ton of drama has begun to unfold due to the worry of people losing friends and family whom were also on the plane.

I can't help but tell you immediately that this film is awful. The only things I actually find worthwhile about this movie are unintentionally comedic moments--many including the midget character that seems to hate everyone. The guy is like a live-action Grumpy Cat manifesto, and I absolutely adore any moment that he's shown on the screen for the sheer fact that he is hysterical (unintentionally, of course).

The acting here isn't even worth talking about. Seriously. There isn't even a flip-out moment with the star, Nicholas Cage, whom is notorious for being borderline psychotic in almost everything he's in. Nope. Nothing. Nada. Because he is playing a character whom wants to keep the people of the plane calm.

And to mention the rapture itself, I now claim that the Chloe character is the Antichrist, due to the second she hugs her brother, he vanishes into thin air. I seriously couldn't hold it in; I laughed so loud at how goofball-ish that moment was that I actually received nasty looks from people whom probably thought I was simply there to make fun of the movie for being Christian. Tsk tsk; I'm on your team, nastylookers.

The CGI, in my opinion, looked solid in the trailers. After seeing the film, I can assure you that you're missing nothing because (a) the movie is very dull outside of its kind-of themes and sort-of touching moments (all of them seemingly taking place at the very end of the film), and (b) because the CGI that is actually used is horrendous. There's even a moment where Chloe is making a life-and-death situation out of herself and she climbs a bridge. You can literally see the greenscreen in bits through her hair. I'm not even kidding.

When it comes to the music in LEFT BEHIND, I can promise you that none of it fits. Remember how the original trilogy barely had music, and when it it did, it was horrible modern Christian Rock? This film doesn't even get that much. It's essentially a collection of songs that sometimes resemble what I would expect from a Pixar film.

I feel that anyone whom might be hoping this will be a so-bad-it's-good situation will be pleased, for the most part. However, anyone else looking for a fun Christian time might as well spend the money on that number they might have found scribbled with a knife into the bathroom stalls of their local barhouse. Because this is awful. This is unruly, to be frank.

God bless the Midget Man! I give LEFT BEHIND an F as a serious rating, but a C as a so-bad-it's-good rating.

Thanks for reading, friends, and God bless you all.

And please don't fall into this pre-tribulation rapture lie."

1992,Left Behind (2014),3.1,Vic Armstrong,"One could've prophesied that I would witness this devilish horror of a movie once it appeared on Netflix. I'm lazy, and this made it too easy. Besides, I tend to enjoy such apocalyptic fiction, and even Nicolas Cage starring in some Evangelical hooey involving planes won't turn me away. I like ""Knowing"" (2009), after all. But, ""Left Behind"" is absolutely dreadful. Every scene is agonizingly contrived and ridden with clichés to push its simplistic religious agenda. There are sinners, and there are saints, and all either any of them do is talk about God. The substandard CGI for the plane stuff is far more realistic compared to just about every conversation in the movie. Additionally, the pacing feels like Purgatory, while the overall experience is like Hell.

The doubled irony of ""Left Behind"" is that its cockeyed moralizing is undermined by focusing on the here and now instead of the hereafter and on the ultimate heroism and good naturedness of the irreligious, whereas the faithful, albeit perhaps inadvertently, get people killed and put many more in danger because of their faith. The true miracle here is that for a movie that's all about religious division, it seems to have brought many of varying beliefs together in denouncing ""Left Behind."""

Digressing from my own philosophical and rational beefs with the entirety of the Abrahamic umbrella model, the scripting, acting, direction, visual effects, overall plot execution of this hypothetical disaster film we're undeniably amateur to the point that, when coupled with the underlying concept being the rapture, it was obviously made by Christian's on a limited budget. I mean REALLY limited, to point where I can only assume Nicholas Cage and Chris Pine contributed as a kind of heart felt attemp at charity (either that or out of desperation to keep debt collectors at an arms length).

It was poorly acted, predictable, unenthralling, clichéd nonsense. And that was just the first half hour, at which point, for the sake of my brain and stopping it melting with the sheer tedium, I walked out of the cinema.

If you're genuinely sad enough to believe that paying good money to see Halle Berry in a PVC suit is good enough reason to spend time gawking at this trash, then fine. Who am I to try to persuade you to try and do something more valuable with your time, like base-jumping without a parachute?

Utterly abysmal"

2002,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Oh, where to start...imagine all the intellectual depth of Showgirls, plus all the excessive and ridiculous special effects of Charlie's Angels, and then throw in some dialog crafted by whomever wrote for Governor Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze in the fourth Batman movie, and only then are you even close to a movie as awful as this.

I suppose one should not expect much from a director who actually refers to himself as Pitof. But let's come back to that. Let's move on to Halle Berry. Note to Halle Berry: Letting Billy Bob Thornton ream you endlessly on camera is certainly degrading, but it was also a good career move--and you won an Oscar; feverishly eating catnip and licking people's faces on camera, however, is not a good career move--and you'll probably win a Razzie this time. They make you return Oscars for movies like this. Oh yeah, as for the supernatural explanation for Patience Phillips/Catwoman's superhero status--she gets CPR from an immortal Egyptian cat--I am not kidding.

And then there is Benjamin Bratt, who happens to be a pretty solid actor, but could have very likely damaged a good career. If his participation in this movie isn't enough to stigmatize him, then I'm sure he had to pass up a lot of good roles because of all the time he spent having his foot surgically removed from his former agent's rectum. There is a scene in this movie--probably the worst, and that's no small achievement--that is reminiscent of that ridiculous scene in Daredevil where Jennifer Garner/Elektra and Ben Affleck/blind superhero have a Kung Fu fight at a playground in broad daylight; in this movie it's Halle Berry and Ben Bratt playing one-on-one hoops and her doing Catwoman flips and yet no one appears to be too amazed by this, much less pants-soiling surprised, and on top of that it has a sort of VH1/Color Me Bad/early New Edition video feel to it. And I'm really not sure what city this is all supposed to take place in--Gotham, Metropolis, the land beneath the whole in the cutting room floor--but apparently this place only has one detective, the unfortunate Bratt. No matter what the crime is--burglary, murder, domestic disturbance, interrupted ballet performance--he's always there.

As for the rest of the cast, that annoying woman from Mad TV--I know that's not specific enough; I mean the most annoying one who plays what I guess is supposed to be some bizarre Asian lady--well, she plays Catwoman's annoying and sort of slutty co-worker comic relief since Rosie O'Donnell was apparently unavailable.

And then we come to Sharon Stone. Now I know her career is going down the crapper with all deliberate speed, but it's still hard to understand this one. The only thing I can guess is that the opportunity to break into silly, pseudo-feminist diatribes made this a role she couldn't turn down. Of course Sharon has often lamented the lack of good roles for older women in Hollywood, and she's absolutely right about that, but this is not the best way to lodge a complaint, and plus that's always been a little peculiar coming from an actress whose greatest cinematic achievement is the conspicuous exposure of her labia.

Briefly back to this Pitof character--I thought that pretentious one-named idiot who did the Charlie's Angels movies--McG, I believe--was bad enough, but this guy is even more shameless and obviously lacking in talent. What's with these guys who've never made a movie and are already going by only one name? Don't you have to work up to that? I mean if is Scorsese wants to go by Marty, fine; if Tarantino wants to be just Quentin, or even just Q, whatever, but where does a hack like this get off using one name? This movie deserves every Razzie it receives, and while some reviewers may say it's not really that bad, remember, it took a lot of money to make this godawful thing, and if people don't speak out about how dreadful it really is, they just might make Catwoman 2. Can you live with that?"
2003,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"A fellow fan of superhero comics once asked me my opinion on the hottest female superhero and my answer was the She Hulk. After watching this movie, my answer will now be Catwoman with Halle Berry in the role. Dressed in a sultry and revealing leather costume with a body as lithe as a cat and a sultry demeanor, she embodies sensuality. Unlike the earlier version that was a super villain, this iteration is fighting evil, specifically a cosmetic company that is about to release a new product. Their research has demonstrated that the product is dangerous to use, but the lure of massive profits is too great. The movements of Catwoman are a triumph of special effects, she leaps and walks on narrow surfaces like a cat and sometimes eats like a starved animal. Action scenes are intense and amazing to watch without there being too much smashing and bashing. Catwoman relies more on her avoidance skills than she does on simply whacking on her opponents. There is a dynamic love interest along with a best female friend that adds significant humor to the movie. The friend is not a sidekick in the usual sense, just a friend with a humorous bent that helps keep the alter ego of Catwoman thinking and acting like a human female. This is a fun movie to watch, one of the few superhero movies where women will enjoy the chic-flick aspects."

2005,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"remember this flick; recall every poorly crafted detail; recite every stale line repeatedly. Why? Because one day, my friend, this train-wreck will be playing at your local buck and a quarter cinema @ midnight 30 with a line of freaks rolling along the walls. Each will be holding a ball of catnip in one hand and a jar of face cream in the other; and you'll be the #1 popularoso if you can recite along with this mutt. All I can say is WOW. That is the worst villain of all time: Marbleface.. my face has become marble from too much toxic face cream? No, this wasn't directed by a Frenchman. I mean it..This movies is A+ cheese. CGI catwoman to real Berry is stunning. Goes from sleek to klutzy instantly. If you like this movie like i do, your rolling on the floor. Every second is purely genius. If you liked it for real, your bus just pulled up, get away from the comp.

Highlights: 1) This is not Catwoman. Catwoman is Selina Kyle; this is patience something or other. This movie was too embarrassing to be connected with such an awesome character 2) My fav part of the lame costume: the shoes with the toes sticking out. 3) Oooooh the most sinister thing we can think of: the fiend knows the face cream is ruining the beautiful girls faces, but wants to profit anyhow. This kind of villainy puts Lex Luthor to shame! 4) Catwoman's freak out with the catnip! This is when the Rocky Horror crowd crowd will toss the catnip balls at the screen 5) You cannot argue with the music too loud scene. period. A keg's nozzle will NOT squirt that far Patience. How did you achieve such a feat. You really are a super hero."

When watching this film you have to come in won't the right mindset, you can't expect it to be accurate in terms of the comics or you will be disappointed. This movie is not dark or serious, it's fun which in turn makes it entertaining. Cat Woman, in this film, is spontaneous, witty, and overall weird. However it makes sense that the character behaves in such a way. From a realistic point of view, if one were to be magically revived by cats, they're bound to experience some odd alterationa in their personality and actions.

2012,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I liked it. OK, it wasn't the best film ever, and yeah, there have been better Catwomen (namely, Julie Newmar and Michelle Pfeiffer), but when you sit and watch it with no expectations, it's actually kind of cool.

From a superhero point of view it's a little one-sided- there aren't any real villains, at least, none who pose a real threat. Although Sharon Stone's character reminded me a tad of Poison Ivy, you know, super-beauty-products and all that jazz. But I quite liked that it showed how someone really quiet and shy can turn into a catty, sexy weirdo.

No offence meant to catty, sexy weirdos.

Catwoman has no real point to it, other than to explain how Patience gets her powers. It would be good if there was a follow-up where she beat Batman / Superman / Poison Ivy or whoever, but since the film did so badly this seems about as likely to happen as pigs flying, hell freezing over, and Ozzy Osbourne announcing a fondness for Girls Aloud. Which is a shame, because I didn't think the film was that bad.

They'd have been better off doing a spin-off from the Batman flicks with Michelle P (or a lookalike) as Catwoman, so the back story wouldn't be necessary.

If you see this movie and are over the age of 16, you will end up hating yourself for letting yourself rot for 104 minutes without getting anything back, except an increased feeling of wanting to get revenge on Hollywood. They say that it is very hard to get your script into a movie. Well, after seeing this movie, I think a one legged monkey could write a better script, without either pen or paper. The fact that Halle Berry even uses a male stunt double, makes me loose all respect for both her and this movie. Besides the stunt double thing, the movie still sucks. The dialog sucks, the acting is not even present and the action looks sloppy and poorly thought through. This movie actually made me like The Core better, which is pretty much impossible. I rate this movie 1/10"

Maybe people were expecting a Christopher Nolan type film that takes itself overly serious but I'm very glad that wasn't this film. This film was fun and entertaining and the IMDb rating is a disgrace. Watch some other films with that kind of low rating and you'll soon see the difference between a bad film and this. 8/
2015,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"24 July 2004. I had doubts, but Halle Berry makes a perrrfect catwoman with her moves and feline behavior. Though a terrible basketball player that stunt doubles or special effects can't hide, her transformation into Catwoman is one of the best personality changes besides The Fly. The action is good, Sharon Stone's script is a little weak though it's good to see her back. The ending is suggestive of Spiderman. Halle isn't so much erotic or sexual as sensual as she herself has described. There isn't so much sex as wild, unbridled heated freedom with enhanced senses. I would think perhaps, this movie might be too threatening for men and a bit out of the box for women. Yet, as a movie - the transformation of the independence of cats into a inhibited, passive women into her own is a powerful message and experience that Catwoman manages to capture. Seven out of Ten Star"

Final- 0.5/10

One word is brought to mind when thinking back to my viewing of, Catwoman- Crap. It might be inspired by my estimation of the film's display of only 12 minutes of living, breathing actors (which I will get into more below). Or it could possibly be inspired by the many errors that there wasn't even an attempt to cover, i.e.- Patience becomes Catwoman after wandering into a restricted area. How did she get into this restricted area, you ask? By walking through the door marked 'RESTRICTED AREA,' in bold, red text, which was simply unlocked and didn't even have a significant locking device on it. You know, I might've also hated the movie (not worthy of the word 'film') because of the pointless-undeveloped story line. And, really, it's not possible to look beyond the disgustingly audacious 'style' of one-named director, Pitof, which can only be described as the style of a headless chicken running through a maze of landmines. Oh, yes, said headless chicken is also being chased by angry natives wielding machetes.

I mentioned above that I estimated that only 12 minutes of living, breathing actors were shown during the entire 140 minutes of film. Almost every sequence of the movie featuring an actor seemed to be butchered by the insertion of CGI's. I'm dead serious. I'm not just talking high-flying, sucky action sequences- I'm talking scenes of Catwoman walking to a motorcycle and calmly getting on it, and the other one that immediately comes to mind is a sequence where a man (a baddie) is simply walking. Yeah, walking. It seems agents and managers are really watching over their clients these days.

Now, two questions I'm asking-

1) What is the point of Catwoman? What the [expletive] does she do?

It's explained in the film that Midnight, the 'magical' cat, chose Patience to become Catwoman, but something is wrong here- CATWOMAN HAS NO PURPOSE!! Every other superhero out there has a purpose- They save people! It seems Catwoman's only purpose is to kill the people who attempted to kill her and chase a cricket or two. There's nothing else to her!

2) Where is the REAL back story?

It sure as [expletive] wasn't in the film! Why wasn't she shocked and attempting to reason and deal with the emotional ass-kicking that would come with the revelation? She's told she's Catwoman by the cliché cat lady, she buys a mask and nails and the result is the 'superhero.' It's adds up, but not into anything of any value whatsoever. Shame on you terrible writers!

Halle Berry is a good actress. I'm not doubting or denying that. She fully deserved her Academy Award nomination and win for 2001's Monster's Ball, but something bad happened here. Her acting started awful and ended awful. I'm hoping the talents and reputation of Berry won't be harmed by her inadequate performance.

Now, My request to Halle Berry- Ms. Berry, I want my money back. I never thought I could see such a terrible performance from an Oscar winning actress. Maybe you were just doing your best with the material? But, you know, that really is not a valid excuse. After reading the screenplay, you should've thrown it in the face of the agent who dared display it to you. How could you not notice how awful it was? Make some better choices and hopefully your career won't plummet as so many others have.

I recall an interview with Ashley Judd, the original casting choice for Catwoman, who said something along the lines of, 'Turning down the role of Catwoman is one the things I regret the most.' Ashley, never say that again. You have only been saved by not appearing in this hilariously terrible film.

Listen people, don't waste your money on this glorified..erum..crap. It's not worth the $6-$15 bucks!

So now you ask, why not just give it a zero? Why the zero-point five? Well, The editing was sufficiently bad; the acting of Alex Borstein could've possibly taken some effort, appropriately placed CGI's were okay, and I like cats.

2021,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"It's pretty genius when you think about how ballsy it was for Warner brothers to create a whole new character of no relation to the dc comics character. Shame some people just can't accept it as as its own thing , only Catwoman in name. I like when studios try something new and attempt to appeal to a whole new audience that might never pick up a comic book in their lives. For starters, There's something appealing about Halle berry in a leather dominatrix outfit jumping on rooftops in the dark urban landscape of Salt Lake City For me it's a action revenge thriller set in the world of beauty products and dark alleys with a hint of a good r&b score. There's a bit of social commentary in here about the way women are treated in the beauty industry at a certain age or it could be about a women accepting her flaws and becoming free with herself. I'm not ashamed to admit I love Catwoman. For its runtime of nearly two hours I can safely argue I wanted more. The film directed by French visual effects supervisor newcomer Pitof feels like a comic book come to live with its vivid colors and wild editing . Countless times we get insane CG crane shots of the beautiful Salt Lake City and the dark alleys Catwoman prowls . While unnecessary it makes for campy fun considering it was the early 2000s and they didn't know how it was gonna fare with audiences. Plenty of people judge its 100 million dollar budget when they forget Halle was paid 12 million dollars and they made statue figurines and a video game that further added to the budget not to mention the promo they did. So there's the 100 mil everybody complains about"
2022,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I enjoyed this movie. It made me laugh at the end of a tough day. ""Camp"" is defined as ""an affectation or appreciation of manners and tastes commonly thought to be outlandish, vulgar, or banal."" It is also defined as ""banality or artificiality when appreciated for its humor."" I agree that movies such as ""Spiderman"" have taken the comic book genre into the realm of serious drama, and I enjoy that as a long-time fan of that comic series. And it would have been interesting to have seen ""Catwoman"" taken in that direction; however, it was not, and we should appreciate and enjoy the movie for what the writers and director chose to do with it. It is as much about Halle Berry as it is the comic book character herself. When Halle makes her appearance in that leather suit, walking along seductively, that will go down in film history right alongside Raquel Welch in her cave woman outfit that we have seen so many times on posters. When Halle throws that little overdone strut into her walk, that brings a smile to my face and actually makes me laugh out loud at times. True, Sharon Stone is over the hill as an aesthetic pleasure, and the plot is as silly as any we have seen. But that is the whole point! Laugh at and with this film, enjoy it as a piece of work not meant to be serious drama. This film rates a B in my book, whereas ""Sky Captain"" is barely a C."

2024,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I have a secret. A dark, troubling secret which I must unburden myself of. You see, gentle reader, I have seen Catwoman. And enjoyed it. I know, I know, it doesn't do to confess to such a thing in polite company. Suggest that I had taken leave of my senses and my only response is a shrug and a smile. Yet, I say, I enjoyed Catwoman. And not in that oh-so-ironic 'so bad it's good' way either. No, I liked it in the 'well I thought that was rather good, actually' kind of way. Which is particularly worrying, because if there is one thing that the world and his wife can agree on, it is that Catwoman is this year's shoe in for a golden turkey award (excepting 'Thunderbirds' and 'the Chronicles of Riddick' of course). I, however, found it to be a fun ride, full of good, schlocky moments, some nice action and boasting a confident visual style and a performance from Halle Berry which falls just the right side of parody. Oh, and the much-derided catsuit definitely gets my vote. I also thought the pairing with Benjamin Bratt worked a treat and Sharon Stone made a satisfying villain. In short, plenty to enjoy.

Naturally, until now, I have been careful to keep this strangely positive reaction to myself. In fact I was so disturbed by my feelings for the movie that I decided to see it again just to make sure I had not missed any of the innumerable horrors the reviews had promised. The second time, to my astonishment, it seemed an even better movie than the first. A few details had initially bothered me. While, for example, some of the special effects worked really well (the transformation scene, Catwoman sliding between two buildings, or tumbling out of one in graceful slo-mo), some didn't. But on second viewing I was surprised to find all these details seemed somehow better integrated into the movie as a whole. I am now thinking of seeing the movie for a third time, but in a decidedly more relaxed frame of mind. Well, I have heard of people that have seen Catwoman up to seven times. Are we all mad? Perhaps so. But I guess we might as well enjoy it. It would be such a shame not to."
2025,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) is a visual artist who is stuck working in the advertising division of a large beauty product manufacturer, Hedare. When she acquires information that could potentially put the company out of business, they try to dispose of her. Because she had previously, unwittingly passed a ""test"", however, she is saved by a group of cats and transformed into a Catwoman.

First, let me note that I loved this film. It's a 10 out of 10 for me. Since I'm well aware that most critics, professional and amateur alike, have trashed this film, I'll focus on why I thought it was so good. Maybe this will help some new viewers consider giving it a look, and possibly encourage some reevaluation by those who have already seen the film.

The script immediately drew me into the film, and although I'm male, I identified with Patience. I'm also a visual artist. I have also worked for a company similar to Hedare in the past (although a much smaller and less nefarious beauty product company). I lived in an apartment that looked, on the outside, almost exactly the same as Patience's apartment complex. I also had neighbors who night after night played loud music or television until three or four a.m., while I first tried to block out the sound in any way that I could, then asked politely for them to turn the music down, and so on, until I finally called the cops on them so I could get some sleep.

Not that I need to identify with a character to like a film, but that made this one have extra resonance with me in the beginning. Additionally, I was immediately drawn in by the fantastic cinematography and set design. Those kinds of things are just as important in a movie as the story is. Film is a visual and aural artform. The whole package is important. Creative, attractive visuals such as those in Catwoman are part of the package.

The script, including the subtexts, worked well for me. Catwoman is a film about discovering identities, peeling away literal and metaphorical masks, and the difference between various stages of public versus private ""faces"". That the plot is centered on a beauty product manufacturer, then, is perfect. These themes permeate every aspect of the film. For example, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) is continually peeling away the appearances of Patience, throughout the length of the film, and Patience is doing the same for herself--discovering her ""true self"". I can't think of a scene that doesn't touch on this theme in some way. That's very clever and thought-provoking scriptwriting, and it doesn't end there. There are also themes about femininity cleverly woven through the film, for example.

I thought the cast did a fantastic job. Berry is great as a Catwoman, and subtly referenced most of the previous screen Catwomen. She also incorporated a lot of crafty cat-like behavior. I enjoyed the supporting cast, especially Alex Borstein as Patience's friend, Sally. The effects worked well for me, and at times they were also very subtle and clever, such as Catwoman's whip representing a tail in many shots (most of this was achieved via digital effects). I was also impressed with the creativity and different approach of many of the fight scenes. It was nice to see Brazilian martial arts incorporated for a change.

Some of the negative criticism probably stems from a kind of purism that is disproportionately found among comic book fans when it comes to comic book films. I'm not much of a purist, but in any event, for anyone paying close attention, you'd note that Berry's character isn't supposed to be Selina Kyle. In the mythology of as presented here, ""Catwoman"" isn't a lone token, but a type. Patience is just another instantiation of a long line of catwomen. So departures from previous portrayals of Selina Kyle aren't relevant, even if we believed that filmmakers were obligated in some way to previous depictions of the ""same"" fictional characters (which I don't believe, not being a purist).

Catwoman is worth a (second) chance if you can leave some of your preconceptions at the door and if you're prepared to think a bit about a comic book film."

2027,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Okay, watched Catwoman today, Expecting, well not much really, except mildly entertaining fight scenes maybe. But I got so much more than that, I found a movie , all be it not Oscar or Award worthy, but a movie, that really did take me from reality for a bit, I become completely emerged in the story which may be silly, but who cares! The fight scenes, where all in my opinion beautifully choreographed, and the CGI, I thought was definitely above average. Hallie Berry was excellent both as Patience and Catwoman. Playing Patience with real raw emotion, and she genuinely did look frightened to speak her mind, but on the other hand as Catwoman Hallie exerts all the sexiness and confidence needed to pull of such a sensual character, and in that tight leather suit she does look HOT!! Sahron Stone is delicious as the sexy villain, and Benjamin Bratt is good enough for he's mainly unimportant character. A lot of people have given this movie a lot of flak and I can kinda see why but not really, if you can call this movie anything it has to be VISUALLY STUNNING, like Gothic, mixed with modern art. The backing Track is excellent, the stunts are better than you would be led to believe, the CGI is definitely a lot better than people have been saying. All in all no where near as bad as it could have been, And isn't it worth going to see Hallie Berrie and Sharon Stone in a cat fight anyway. All in all a fun filled, visually striking twist thrilled ride from begging to very end.

2028,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Superheroes are best defined by the qualities of the villains they must overcome.

Benjmain Bratt's performance is admittedly not as strong as Peter O'Toole's in Supergirl, but really, who can match that classic thespian? He's at least as good here as he was in ""Miss Congeniality"".

2033,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"You might find that when making an action-hero movie from the Comic Books is never going to be accurate to the story lines therein. That is why when Hollywood decides to make a movie on such action-heroes they have to placate the millions that might see the movie, who might get interested in reading the comic book heroes. So they always have to ""Hollywoodize"" the plots and characters. Otherwise if they stuck to the accuracy of the characters and plots the only people going to see such movies as ""Catwoman"" would be the few nerdy fans that have no life but to read and analyze and philosophize their ideals of Comic Book stories. With enough said on the matter, ""Catwoman"" was maybe not the best film, but definitely not the worse. I found Halle Berry's character extremely sexy and charming. There is something about a sexy woman in a leather outfit, whip and claws I find fascinating. I found the plot to be more realistic than the stupid version when Catwoman is featured in the Batman sequel. Although I am critical that the movements of Catwoman were a little awkward, especially when she was climbing and crawling. But then that is direction problem and computer enhancement issues. Halle Berry surprised me. Although I love her better as Storm, she did a rather good job. I found the movie entertaining. Not a complete waste of time. It maybe not as violent or explosive or raw as other Comic Book character movies, but I found it to be worth watching and making my own mind up about it. Rather than listening to rantings of no value."
2034,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Wow...I have never seen such horrendous footage in my life! I would normally never knock something without having seen it in its entirety, but this film is utter $hit! Put it back in the litter box and throw it out!

I've seen about 45 minutes of footage and it really looks like something someone did as a flash film and they thought ""Hmm...this would look cool on film!!""

I think it's total and utter betrayal of the character's roots is bad enough, but to compound that by ripping off elements from other comic-based action films (The Crow, Spider-Man 1 & 2, etc.) is just adding more nails to this already sealed coffin.

The only positive reviews I have read seem to say that ""It wasn't as bad as everyone said it was, but it was bad"". That isn't a positive review. The only people who enjoyed this film are pre-pubescent guys who will never know the touch of a woman without shucking out a few hundred bucks for it.

This film is a disgrace to comics, movies, and mankind in general, and any woman who thinks this film is ""empowering"" is probably some young promiscuous woman will will be called ""MAMA"" before she hit age 17.

Beware this movie, and avoid it like the freaking' plague."
2035,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,I loved the movie and it has potential to go farther. True it is not the DC catwoman everyone knows and loves. But it is one of the modern age that tells us that we can do things if we put our minds to it. If you can accept this or take it as an alternate reality then you have a better chance at enjoying the movie. Lets not forget the research and training that went into the film. Most of the cats are real and some of the proceeds that Halle Berry made went to charity. Not many famous people do that from earnings on a movie.

2038,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Really, Halle Berry is not as bad as people think. Compared to movies like Spiderman and X-men, no of course not, Catwoman would not be on that list. But, compared to horrible comic book films like Daredevil and The Hulk, Catwoman is OK. The many behind the scenes specials that was aired to promote the movie, you see that Halle is doing most of her own stunts in this film.In the film, it is put together very well with over the top CGI effect so Halle did have the whole Eartha Kitt/Michelle Pfeiffer vibe, if not better because Michelle nor Eartha did their own stunts, sorry, but they were just pretty faces but great actors.Batman Returns is the only good movie coming out of the Batman series.So Michelle is one of the best infamous catwomans. So Halle becoming a fighting machine is applauded.

The CGI effect could have been a lot less in the film and Sharon Stone performance in this film is overrated, but not as bad as Demi Moore's comeback.(Sharon Stone is trying to make a comeback right?) Benjamin Bratt is a great leading man, but we all know a leading man, or what Hollywood like to call it ""love interest"" ,had to be in the film.Superheroes are best defined by the qualities of the villains they must overcome. Some action sequences are really good, then some are mediocre, and then some are just plain boring.

Halle one liners are hilarious and of course she is great to look at. She did an ""ok"" performance in this movie and the many people that was in the private screening, it was too many people in there I might add and there were even more outside trying to get in, seem to enjoyed it. This movie is not to be taken that seriously, compared to Spiderman and X-men, it is not on its level. Even though Spiderman and Catwoman, both had overrated CGI effects, like the poorly I, Robot,please skip that movie, not worth your money, its an enjoyable movie with likable and non-likable characters with added great performances from Frances Conroy, Lambert Wilson and even the animated Alex Borstein.I also might add it is not as terrible as Batman& Robin, Daredevil, or The Hulk!!!!!!! 7/10"

The most unfortunate thing I can think of saying about this film is that it had the misfortune of opening up against bigger blockbuster films like the Bourne Supremacy and I, Robot, while Spiderman 2 was still going strong also. This is a good little action-type movie that should be given a chance. Ignore the critics (I ALWAYS do) and check it out for yourself.

It's fun comic book movie. No it's not Spiderman 2, there's no deep character conflicts that wrap the viewer in the complex mind of a conflicted confused hero, that's all Marvel babe and this is DC. The comic book styles are different and so are the movies. Anyway you look at it Catwoman is an excellent origin film. That's why I can't wait of Catwoman II to see where and how the character develops.

Catwoman is fantastic. Halle worked that cat suit, she even inspired me to go to the gym. Berry became Catwoman, she embodied the feline femme fatale. The way she moved after becoming Catwoman would've have made my kittens proud, it was feline fantastic. Then there's the romance. Berry and Bratt made a sexy couple and their chemistry was magical. Sharon Stone was purrfectly b___y and I mean that as a complement some times a woman's gotta do what a woman's gotta do. It's a fun film all around. Love the catfights, love the romance, love the man crazy friend, I loved this movie. If it were the 90s I'd give it two around the world snaps. It's not about feminism it's about independence. It's not about the old Catwomanits about the new Catwoman and she still could kick Batman's butt if she wanted or seduce him if she chose to. If you look closely Halle pays homage to the other Catwomen. To top it all off the soundtrack is grrreat."

2044,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs

Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) is a pathetically meek graphic designer at a cosmetics firm who's also so utterly f*cking thick she does such idiotic things as risking her life by climbing onto a building to rescue a cat!However,one day she inadvertently learns that her bosses are planning to release an addictive anti-ageing cream (?!?) onto the shelves,and finds her life coming to a premature end.Or,is that beginning,as she finds herself turning into Catwoman,heroic defender of law and bringer of justice.

There is a distinctly cruel irony whereby a film can end up receiving so many bad reviews (which are meant to deter people from watching the film!) people end up watching it anyway...just to see how bad it is.I suppose on the basis of that,I should seek out 1998's The Avengers sometime.I'd like to give Showgirls a go sometime too (I missed it when they showed it on Channel 4 recently.) Yep,in terms of 2004's most major cinematic disaster,Catwoman was,well,not to put too fine a pun on it,the cat that got the cream.Opening to abominable reviews,from everyone from Empire to Zoo magazine,it was ushered out of cinemas during the 'summer blockbuster' period almost as quickly as it was released.It then placed it's lead star in the embarrassing position of accepting a razzie award having earned an Oscar for her devastating turn in Monster's Ball only a few years earlier.

It is a pretty dreadful film,but there are arguably a lot worse.It's main problem is the story,which is so uninteresting,but the same could be said of the action on display.Also,this is a film that's managed a pretty notorious achievement.It makes Halle Berry look unsexy.The first suit we see her strutting around in is okay and fairly pleasing to the eye,but the main one (the one she's in on the poster) is really unsexy and unflattering.

If you want to engage your curiosity value,go right ahead,but I hope you know what you're letting yourself in for.**"
2045,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Dramatically unfair reviews

This is a far better film than the notice it is receiving. This movie is being soundly trashed -- and it does not deserve to be.

The reviewers have trashed this film and everyone seems to be jumping in on the bandwagon. Having seen the film I can tell you for an absolute fact that this is unfair. I think someone has put the word out to get this movie and that is just what is happening.

This is not the best super-hero movie ever made, but it is a good one. There is much to be respected  and enjoyed in this film. In my opinion movies based upon DC Comic characters are working with less rich material than their Marvel Comic counterparts. Given its DC heritage, this is a reasonably good effort.

In any event, it certainly compares favorably with the Laura Croft films. Something unfair is going on here. Please do not let the poor reviews stop you from going to see this movie with an open mind.

I could go on and on about its good aspects  of which there are more than a few  but my advice is  You should see it for your self and make up your own mind.

You should see it for your self and make up your own mind.

You should see it for your self and make up your own mind.

Do you know what I mean?

Please think for yourself on this one.

Enjoy"

2047,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,It certainly had me glue to my seat for 104 minutes. It is over the top but it is from a cartoon strip. Halle Berry looked gorgeous & so did Sharon Stone. Great Fun. I really enjoyed
2048,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"As a film it is solid. The action moves and most important of all is Berry who holds the camera like it was glued to her, everything from the ball-bearing hips to the deliberately skewed facial posture she sticks in front of the lens -- it is all says, this is a movie about me. Enjoy it.

Yes, I know that the critics of the day (2004) did not see it that way but time-specific gestalt is not the mission of the reviewer to decipher. A reviewer looks at a film for posterity's tastes and that is what I usually try to do.

The backstory is much more troublesome than the movie. Both Bratt and Berry are/were A-listers who deserved better roles and better respect than Hollywood gave them. I think Berry herself would be the most chagrined to learn that posterity will consider this one of her most memorable performances. That the last 3 minutes were an obvious setup for a franchise only makes a sad observation ... sadder."
2049,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I thought Catwoman was a real good film. People started criticizing it mostly because it wasn't based on Selina Kyle. But, if the people would actually read about it before they criticized it, it would be a better understanding. In the old Batman show, the Catwoman played by Eartha Kitt had a granddaughter named Patience Phillips, who lived in Lake city. See?? but I thought it was good. Although there was too much animation opposed to real life, me and all my friends thought it was good. Her costume was real good, because it wasn't copying any other Catwoman of the past, and she looked good in it too. I say go suck a lemon to whoever said it was bad. I thought Halle was a purr-fect Catwoman"
2050,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Someone has commented that he thinks it is weird that ""Isn't it strange that a whole back of positive comments for ""Catwoman"" just popped up in the past few days? What is even stranger is that 8 of these positive ""reviewers"" have reviewed only one movie: Catwoman. ""

I would like to say, even though I have never reviewed any movie before and wasn't one of the 8 people this guy is referring. I do get an IMDb account to just to vote for Catwoman in hoping that it won't sink down the bottom 100. This is my first voting on IMDb because I am really lazy to get an account and fill up application form. I just want to read other people's comments.

However, I am really irritated that there are so many people who are trashing this film when they have either never watched the film or already form judgments before they went watch the movie. That's why I decided to contribute my first vote and first message to Catwoman.

I personally found the movie to be really entertaining. I went to watch the movie with 4 other friends and all five of us loves it.

This movie may not to be best movies ever but I found it really really cute and sweet. The last summer movie that I think is as entertaining as this one is PoTC. I really like the chemistry between Halle and Ben. They make such a cute couple together. It also has a lot of humorous scenes. For anyone who is giving this movie a 0 rating, please go watch this film first before you make your judgments."
2051,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I was thrilled when I discovered that there was going to be a Catwoman movie. I didn't mind that it wasn't Selina Kyle, in fact, I thoroughly enjoyed a brand new Catwoman. It was nice to learn about the background and historical significance of the Catwoman legend. I liked how they introduced the idea of different generations of Catwomen. I do admit there is some 'corny' parts in the movie but I think its worth every penny!! The main reason people do not like it (at least from the review I read about it) was because they critic was expecting Spider-man material. NO! Don't do that! Catwoman and Spiderman are practically polar opposites. You are an idiot for expecting that if that is what you did! If you are looking for a fun, sexy, action packed movie, go see Catwoman! IT'S FANTASTIC!!!!!"
2052,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"You should not sit down to watch a movie as fun as Catwoman and expect to see a masterpiece such as The Godfather or Casablanca played out on screen. It is a full-throttle and entertaining leisure view with a far from perfect, but interesting story and Halle Berry is simply amazing as Catwoman, in my honest opinion. One mistake I have actually seen a few ignorant people make though is that Patience Phillips is not the Catwoman that has been played out in the Batman phenomenon, she is a version of the essence/character that is Catwoman, and in any matter she is a damn fine one at that. She might not be the best portrayal of the character in Catwoman history, since so many think that is so, and she might be the worst, but that doesn't mean she is bad and she is unable to be found enjoyable.

I don't care if this film stuck to the original characterizations of Catwoman or not anyway. It does not make the character of Catwoman out to be the villain or the superhero, just the figure that is Catwoman who strives for what she desires and in the end it's what I really enjoy about it. It seems like working hard for what she wants is what Catwoman is all about anyway, so doesn't that stay true to what people have been familiar with from Catwomen in the past in some way? The plot is the worst aspect, but not bad. What kind of plot were people really expecting from a film called ""Catwoman"" and there had been no confirmations that it had anything to do with Batman? It really doesn't matter, because when the cast played out the scenes all the problems it has fade away, in my opinion, for how delightful and exciting they manage to be.

Some final thoughts are that it had excellent action, great outfits and was overall a hell of a fun ride from the very beginning to the very end. It's entertainment value and flair makes up for what it lacks in solidity and depth, but most don't believe it has any value whatsoever. In any matter, I enjoy it every time I watch it. The performances are fantastic for what it set out to do regardless of what Halle Berry said at the Razzies. Why would an actor/actress try to boast themselves when excepting a Razzie anyway? Her catsuit was sexy! I love this movie, as do other people, it is just that the hate shadows the required appreciation it receives from the minority of viewers."
2053,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"It's a shame that critics can use their power to ruin a movie. Catwoman was a good movie. It was more interesting than I.Robot, Spiderman 1, Hulk, Daredevil & Batman 1. I think politically Hollywood wanted to assure it's golden boy (Matt Damon) a good weekend. It also wanted to say how dare Halle Berry & Sharon Stone headline a movie. Some actually believe that Matt Damon & all that he represents in our society are ""Born Supreme""

The movie had likable characters that you could care about. Halle Berry mad a nice transition between the meek side & the Catwoman side. She looked fantastic! The special effects were great. They were on a par with Spiderman 2. Benjamin Bratt was a good choice of leading man. I went in expecting the worst & was pleasantly surprised. As for critics I say ""Those that can...DO, those who can't...TEACH, those who can't do either...become Critics!!"
2054,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"This movie was entertaining enough to make it buy able on DVD. If you have not seen the hulk, or Spider-man 1 this movie may seem bad. But for a comic character movie this one was very good. I admit that the second spider man was better than this one, though. The actual ""bad Guy"" and her horrible plot to make women's faces deformed using evil face cream was a tad cheesy. but the rest was great!

The actors were good. The computer generated cats were so realistic. And most of the special effects were awesome.

I give this movie a 10 because its probably one of the best comic character movie o"
2055,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Halle Barry did an excellent portrayal of cat woman. In fact, she brought new dimensions to this fictional character in regards to being a dynamic, round, intelligent, caring, loving, extremely attractive, athletic, growing woman.

The other characters in the movie were perfect for their respective roles, especially cat woman's beatable nemesis.

There was some speckles of humor by one of the characters that was worth wile. It was actually funny. I really enjoyed all the elements (characters & props) that forged this film. They (all involved) did a pretty good job on this movie despite what renown critics say.

I would recommend this DVD to be introduced to anyone's collection.

Oh, another great thing...there was no sex scenes as most movies tend to deem a necessity for sales. This is also encouraging to those woman (and men) who struggle with accepting who they are. There are messages here (in the movie). There are even some faith connotations as well. See if you can catch it."
2056,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,Catwoman is the best movie ever. I don't understand why some people don't like good movies? Halle Berry is so cool in this movie. Halle played Catwoman much better than Michelle Pfeiffer in Batman Returns. Even Halle's costume is better. Better action scenes and a much better plot. I saw the movie on Saturday and the theater was full. Even my family loved the movie. This is one of my favorite action movies now. This movie rocks 2004 for the best action movie made this year and any other year. I really loved this movie. I really enjoyed this movie because it was so cool. Even though the movie is about cats it is still a very good movie for the family to see. I would go see this movie again and agai
2057,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I Just saw this movie today and after watching it i figured that the ratings on IMDb would be great but when i saw the ratings being so low i was shocked and surprised because this movie definitely is a minimum 5 out of 10. The ratings are unfortunately low but the movie was great and entertaining and that is what matters the most. I would love to see a sequel but i don't think there's any chances. This movie is definitely way better than any Batman movie out there, i am not into batman at all as it is a boring movie and a boring character compared to superman and spiderman which are 2 wicked characters. Despite the fact that Catwoman may not fit into the 'super-hero' category and therefore might not be expected to be great but i found the movie to be worth a top rating of 8 out of 10!! So i strongly disagree with the false ratings that this movie go"
2058,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"That was the best movie that had to do with super heroes I had ever seen. I love Cat Woman the movie. I even love cats and have two of them. I saw it on TV and I will get the movie soon. I give Cat Woman two thumbs up. I wish I was a cat like Cat Women. That would be so cool. It was a PURRfect movie. I love Cat Woman enough to right ten lines for a comment for the movie. This is the comment I was talking about. If you have not seen Cat Woman, you should. You will like it. The movie has action and other things, too. I want to see this movie again. I always wish for something to happen to me like in movie. Just like Cat Woman. Me"
2059,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"A woman comes back from the dead with newfound powers to avenge her death and continue living a happier and self confident life. She leaps from building to building and roughs up anyone who gets in her way. It's ""The Crow"" meets ""Batman"" (as in Tim Burton's ""Batman"") with a female twist - and she's not even white. That concept may be scary for some people.

Warner Bros. did themselves a disservice by promoting this as being about the comic book character of ""Catwoman"", because it simply isn't.

This is a completely newly developed character with a new back story, new powers and a new costume. After you realize that you are going to see a really exciting, well made and interesting movie. The story itself is simple but except for a few cheesy CGI scenes it is well executed and played by a group of really capable actors. It doesn't have the unnerving pathos and the gaping logic-holes of ""Spider-man 2"" or the stupid history bending storyline of (an otherwise nice) ""Hellboy"". This movie has a nice bit of European touch by director Pitof, combined with the American influence from the production team and actors.

Halle Berry's Oscar-winning acting rings this character to life and her stunning looks in that revealing costume will have some guys close to a heart attack.

So it may not be art - superhero movies rarely are - but it's definitely an entertaining movie and you can have a really good time watching it, if you give it a chance."
2060,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I can't believe 206 people voted Catwoman a 1. What are they looking for in a fantasy? A smart, talented woman, who is taken for granted by the company she works for, dies and comes back as a cat. Now she can add sexy and confident to her former persona. She's also skilled in marshal arts and capable of taking care of herself as well as do battle with the evil forces of this world. This is the comic book formula that has been successful since they first thought up this character.

I came away believing that this female, super heroine will develop her newly found role to be more mature and conservative in the future. I was well entertained and absolutely loved the movie. I gave it a 10 for costume, authenticity, casting and plot. Halle Berry is synonymous with sexy -- Catwoman has always been sexy -- go read the comic boo"
2061,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"That's it! Smash it! Forget all of the bad and gruesome commentary that you've heard that related to the movie. First off, I would like to say that one person compared this movie to Spider man 1 and 2 and talked about graphics. Now, yes, this movie was quite awesome because of the graphics. Come on, they were perfect. Yes, Halle Berry was eye candy and, yes, why in the hell wouldn't she be? She's a lovely actress and she is very beautiful.

She played the three sides to the character, very well: 1. Patience Phillips 2. Patience Phillips (renewed) 3. Catwoman And, all of those roles had a little bit of something to them that made this movie the great one that it is. Want some advice, people? O.K., here's some. GO TO SEE THE MOVIE! IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY OF YOUR MONEY AND YOU WILL ENJOY IT FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END.

There were so many laughs in the theatre. So many oooohhhs and ahhhhs that I can't even count. Halle Berry's acting skill brought this movie to justice. It was very action packed and very sexy and romantic. No Catwoman ever did romance like this movie did it. Most of the guys in the theatre didn't even come to see Halle Berry's acting, because they were more focused on her skin tight outfit. But, still, they were pleased with her comedic attitude and seriousness. The movie's all the rage and you should see it. So, enough commenting. Grab your wallet and go to the theatre."
2062,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"You know, I don't think the point was really to make a realistic or dramatic or faithful Catwoman movie. I think the point was to make a fun movie that people of all ages can enjoy. And if you look at it that way it's really an incredible movie. It was recommended to me by a friend, and I will always be grateful for the recommendation. Thanks "

2064,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I scored a free ticket to this movie, and I thought, hey, I've wasted my whole life up to now, what's another hundred and forty-one minutes? After all, I have a higher tolerance for crap than most people, and, once in a while, I like to see something that completely sucks. According to the critics and to voters on IMDb, Catwoman is supposed to suck bad. Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, the movie really doesn't suck. I mean, yeah, it sucks, but it hardly plumbs the depths of true suckitude. Currently it sits at #35 on the IMDb bottom 100, but I can think of way more than 34 other movies that suck far worse than Catwoman. It is much more fair to say that it is a mediocre, perhaps slightly below average, action film. It has a few pros and lots of cons. The cons first: 1) The jumpy editing is awful. 2) Way too much CGI. Same problem with the 500 pound gorilla comic book movie out right now, as well. CGI is probably the worst thing ever to happen to cinema; it's hard to believe people are worshiping a technique that looks more fake than stop-motion. 3) Benjamin Bratt is a horrible actor, and the ugliest handsome man I've ever seen. 4) How the f*ck did Alex Borstein land a movie role? She should be doomed to die on MAD TV, the longest running train wreck of a show ever. 5) Crappy, crappy script. The pros: 1) The film looks wonderful, even though that's due mostly to the CGI (I guess when it's making buildings and inanimate objects like that, it's not so bad). The costume design, even apart from the Catwoman outfit. And if they gave out Oscars to hair stylists, the ones who worked on this film would have no competition. 2) Sharon Stone  not a great performance, by any means. Her character is downright silly, perhaps even nonsensical. But she's gorgeous and has a great presence. She makes a really boring villain somewhat more interesting. 3) Duh! Halle Berry! She might not have the best ability to choose roles. Perhaps she's just obsessed with money, and now that she's got a statuette, she's going to do everything in her power to become a billionaire. Whatever you can say about her, she's a great actress. Last year, she brought Gothika up a notch, and she does a lot to make Catwoman more entertaining than it ought to be. She plays the characters' two halves, the sweet, insecure girl and the dominatrix, very well. And, come on, I'd be lying if I said I didn't go to the movie because I thought Berry would be walking around in a leather outfit for a good portion of the movie. And, damn, she's hot. This makes the movie watchable, if nothing else. There's a shot where the camera circles Berry from toe to head right after she first dons the Catwoman which was worth the price of me embarrassing myself by handing my free pass over to the cute little theater girl at the counter. 5/10."
2065,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"First let me say that before I saw this I expected it to be absolutely terrible. The reviews and negative buzz about this is absolutely huge. But why? Most likely because humans are heavily dependent on social acceptance for survival (at least in the old days, i.e. BC). This has an annoying effect of massing non-critical thinkers into joining a mass movement of ""public opinion"", and quite often it gains speed and soon everyone is ""doing it"". What I mean by this is that people are afraid to say that the movie was good because everyone else says it's bad and they're afraid to be outside the ""norm"" of public opinion. Another thing in this same general area is feverent bashing of something to ""fit in"". It's the same thing as with homophobia, democrats, republicans and other groups of polarized opinion holders. In order to be accepted, the person desiring to be in the group does as others in the group does... it's simply monkey-see monkey-do in order to be accepted by a group.

So, with that intro into why the movie is being panned so badly, here's what I thought of the movie: It's good. The script is consistent and well written. The acting is good as is the direction (aside from the fighting sequences). There are plenty of interesting scene presentations and scene fades. The movie was not some flash-bang rushed project... there is a lot of thought behind every aspect of the movie. My only complaint with the whole film is the fighting sequences are frenetic and incohesive since the fight scene consists of MANY 1-3 second clips spliced together (the same scene filmed with multiple cameras, and switching between the cameras every 1-3 seconds). This breaks up the fight scenes into a collage of disjointed flash images that just make the action hard to follow. Aside from that, the CGI and action sequences are done quite well and are imaginative. Character development is excellent (if not somewhat predictable) but one does wind up caring what happens the protagonists. Some people complain about the ""silly"" story. Well this is a fantasy flick and I didn't have any problem at all with the evil cosmetics company threatening mankind. In fact it's just the over-the-top kinda aspect that really makes this film work. The whole film is very over the top in terms of the catwoman character and her adjustment to being infested with spirit ala cat. But it is done in a playful way and is actually the source of many of the humorous moments of the film. Overall, it's a movie based on a comic book character... don't' get all bogged down in ""it's so unrealistic"" - you'll be denying yourself some good IL' fashioned fantasy entertainment. I subtract one point for the lame fight scenes (reminds me of gladiator fight scenes). Final score: 9/10 (But I gave it a 10 in the voting to offset the bozo-votes of the sheep out there)."
2066,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I just viewed my birthday present last evening and in a word, this was loads of fun!!!!! Halle is as luscious as ever.

First of all, this is basic comic book fare. Therefore those of you expecting a Masterpiece Theatre production should get a grip.

Of course the plot may not have been overwhelming. But neither was it in Superman, Spider Man, Hellboy, Hulk, or Spider Man II for that matter.

And why would Halle attach herself to a project such as this? There are infinitely more important intangibles here at work.

How many young girls of color ever get to have such a beautiful, award-winning actress, of color, personify the empowerment of women? I submit that Catwoman is a wonderful exercise in showing how pivotal one's blossoming can be - the movie also addresses the dilemma of accepting responsibility for one's own actions as well an interesting foray into choosing good over evil (or vice-versa).

Of course I have seen movies with better plots, tighter screenplays, more intricate direction, more elaborate sets, blah, blah, blah.

One thing is certain: NONE of them have Halle Berry slinking up and down the street as Catwoman, the LAST Dominatrix, so sexy and fetching and just plain WORKIN' NERVES!!!!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, it just doesn't get much better than THAT!!!!! The movie was fun. Did it need (or purport to be) more than that? I daresay any of the other recent comic book adaptations provided much more either and yet critics were infinitely kinder. No matter. The nature of the beast.

Halle and company made a fun, entertaining movie that teaches basic life lessons in a familiar milieu. Additionally, a priceless special feature of the DVD was the ""Face of Catwoman"", a featurette chronicling Catwoman's many incarnations narrated by none other than Eartha Kitt!!!!!!!"
2067,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I have read so much about this movie, and as i sat down to watch it, i didn't expect much, but as i watched it, it was just like any other comic book movie, lots of colour and over the top acting, but this film had a bonus which is Halle Berry , i mean whats not to like, there was nothing wrong with her acting, with anyones acting really i mean its not Hamlet after all, and i got to see Halle in a cool leather outfit purring like a cat, i mean mmmmmmmmmm. I really enjoyed this film, i mean compared to the batman movies ( batman begins not included) Cat Woman was a master piece, good FX and as good as most super hero story lines.

2068,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I LOVED this movie. It was a great action flick and as a start to a new series of movies, it couldn't have been better. The incorporation of the classical views of cats and women is very intelligently done, and the character of Patience is believable and smart.

She is an amazing super hero/villain. I have always adored the character of Catwoman, especially as the anti industry ecological activist. I like the direction they are taking the character. No longer simply a sexy counterpart of Batman, Catwoman has her own agenda, her own personality.

Halle is a very talented actress who brings to life a very complex character with both respect and innovation. The Catwoman idea is not used simply as a gimmick, it is a very believable and respectable transformation.

I doubted the casting when I first heard the movie was being made but now, I think that anybody but Berry would have been a mistake, she brought both glamor and humility to the role.

So, go see this movie and enjoy it for what it is. Don't compare it to other comic book movies because the character is not just a comic book character. She has grown beyond the confines of the page and has erupted on the silver screen as a powerhouse of action and sexuality, she is Catwoman hear her roar... and I for one, will be roaring along with her."

I tried to like it, but from the moment a CGI cat appears when a real cat would have been far more effective and easier to produce, I couldn't stop cursing myself for having given the filmmakers my money. It is the most unmitigated piece of sh*t I have ever seen, worse still than Batman and Robin.

The plot is like an episode of Baywatch, Halle Berry is completely unsexy and the effects are pure rubbish. Not to mention the stinking direction. I hope that ""Pitof"" never sullies the cinema again with this kind of tripe.

Well, as a visual effects producer myself, I can say with confidence that he shouldn't give up his day job - directing VFX is very different to directing a film.

2075,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"After reading some horrendous (and I mean really, really bad reviews of 'Catwoman', I was definitely considering giving it a miss). I have to say that after having seen it, I am absolutely at a loss to words as to why the critics have mauled it so doggedly, and in my opinion unfairly. Were we watching the same film? What was so bad about it? Sure so the plot was on the thin side and the dialogue was highly camp, but other than that I can't see what has provoked the spewing of critical vomit all over this film. Halle Berry makes an adorable Patience, and displays her vulnerability believably and effectively. On the other hand, she really sexes up the screen as Catwoman with the witty one-liners, the hot costume and the raunchy whip cracking. Once again Halle has displayed her versatility.

This film is called Catwoman, the name should explain itself. I don't understand why people are ripping it to shreds or calling it laughable, e.g. as in the way Patience acts becoming Catwoman, i.e. the catnip incident (once), the hissing at dogs (once), the tuna (once, which I found to be amusing), the prancing around. What exactly did you expect her to do? How else do you act like a cat? How else does a human gain feline tendencies? Got any better ideas? I didn't think so. Yet we don't rip Toby Maguire to shreds when he shoots web from his arms (yeah like THAT makes sense.) There is clearly a double standard approach adopted by some critics, who contradict themselves more then they'd care to admit. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy Spiderman as well as this.

This not brain food and you don't have to evaluate your life after it but hey, people need that once in a while. It's a fun movie... The CGI was NOT bad, sure it was obvious at times that it wasn't Halle but for the most part it was done to a high standard. Let's be honest here and give credit where credit is due the cinematography is superb. It has such a visual allure, a dark, rich atmospheric look, and it is almost sexy to look at. The camera work is very original looking, kudos to Pitof, am I the first person to actually praise him? I think so. The scene where the Egyptian Mau brings Patience back to life is beautiful and picturesque. The music creates an epic mood.

Sharon was fun to watch as the 'past it', shallow, bitchy Laurel Hedare. Alex Borstein shined as Patience's best friend and Benjamin Bratt did the best that he could with what he was given as dialogue. Lambert Wilson plays his part, in the usual camp style, but does it to perfection. All in all the acting is not bad, and unless somebody has a personal vendetta against Halle Berry, it can't be said that she didn't put her all into the part. She was sizzling as Catwoman. One critic in particular said that she looked ""as sexy as a hairball in the outfit"". Either a jealous woman or a man with terrible taste in women must have written that. Halle has undeniable sex appeal in the part. The soundtrack is typical summer movie fare with the usual dramatic theme song, mixed with the current popular styles, hip-hop, r'n'b. This is after all a film that has to appeal to a teenage audience. The action scenes are exciting and well executed. The ending is suitably over the top but still entertaining. One scene that I thought was ridiculous was the basketball scene and some of the dialogue could have been much better, however the positives weigh out the negatives for me.

This is no Citizen Kane or Pulp Fiction but its no Gigli or Swept Away either. I have seen way worse comic book movies. Daredevil, Hell Boy and undoubtedly Hulk were worse than Catwoman. It is, on no level one of the worst films ever made. What were people thinking writing that? I went in with the lowest expectations possible for Catwoman and came out of the theatre having seen a supremely entertaining, undeniably above average film. Critics should be ashamed of themselves and audiences should not be puppets. This is worth seeing. There has been a 'Let's jump on the bandwagon' attitude regarding this film. One person bashes it and suddenly everybody does. I'm glad I went to see this film so I could make up my own mind regarding it. I usually do agree with critics but on this one, I beg to differ. Everybody is entitled to an opinion, you might not like mine, and I might not like yours but there is no need to be downright nasty and unfair when reviewing something. There is such a thing as being balanced. Oh and before people start complaining about the absence of Selina Kyle, and Gotham city, who cares, life is too short.

So if you want to some light, leave your brain at the door entertainment, go to see Catwoman. If you want to see a high drama Oscar category film, go to see something else. It's fun, sexy action-packed, camp, stylish summer fare. It is a step above the usual Hollywood fare in the style stakes. Pitof shows a typically stylish French attitude. Halle Berry does herself proud. If you want to be a gullible puppet, believe the 'we're failed artists', overly critical, intellectually snobby critics. I don't really care if that seems like a generalisation because it is most likely true. I bet many of them haven't even seen it. See it for yourself, and make up your own mind. I look forward to a sequel.."
2076,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"2.6 and already in the bottom 100! Why? I was expecting a really bad movie but was actually quite suprised. It's a lot better then Daredevil & Hulk for a start, the CGI may look ropey but it's just as bad in Spider-man 2 and you should really expect it by now.

Halle Berry was watchable, I wanted to say she was awful especially since she ruined the last Bond movie but compared to the wooden performance of Uma Thurman in the highly regarded Kill Bill, they should give her another osca"
2077,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Hmm its hard for me to comprehend how a movie like Spiderman gets so many votes , Catwoman is the same quality if you ask me in fact i think its far superior at best. Spiderman had NOTHING new to contribute its in many ways a clone of its own ... Catwoman may not have a lot of new techniques but it works !! some people badmouth it without the knowledge of the real catwoman ( the marvel cartoon ).. eg just because Catwoman jumps from building in stealth doesn't make it a bad movie maybe you all should take notes or something considering that hale berry is catwoman and not a cat .. The statement that a cat would make noise is plain stupid .. Besides Hale does a far better job than Toby she identifies herself with catwoman Toby does not.. About the plot i really cant sea what all the fuss about what about Spiderman then ? thats a joke .. This ain't a thriller its based on a cartoon and plots in cartoons is for the common folk .. since comics is directed at kids"
2078,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this film. It was hilarious watching Halle act like a cat. She really threw herself into the role and didn't mind how silly she looked or sounded. If you're a fan of boring melodrama that creeps into some other superhero films then stay away from this one-Catwoman is simply about a mousey woman that becomes empowered physically and emotionally to take control of her life and kicks a little ass.

The only thing I think was a bit weak was the cgi (about the same level as Spiderman 1) but they only used if when she runs up walls etc-all the ground fighting looked really good.

If you want to see a very entertaining film with cheesy dialog (I mean that as a good thing), great action, and great performances, check it out. I'm sure that over time the IMDb rating will increase dramatically as more people get out to see it."
2079,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"i loved it! i went into the theater excited because i love the idea of a separate catwoman franchie but i was also abit skeptical after the negative reviews it is receiving and the very low score it has garnered at the IMDb.com. i have to say that i was pleasantly surprised that i liked it as much as i did. the special affects were really nice, not the best i have seen but still really smooth! another thing i was expecting to hate was the costume! i will be the first to admit that my 8 year old nephew could have designed a better costume after only seeing the one in batman returns, but i will also admit that as badly as i wanted to hate the costume, i couldn't! it helped that it was draped on the lovely ms berry but that withstanding...it served its purpose! patience starts out as a dowdy artist, but then she becomes catwoman! she isn't really sure of herself or her powers so she kind of approaches it slowly. at first her costume is just leather pants and a leather jackett...but as she learns more about her abilities and her powers progress, she becomes more open/provocative with herself and her costume!

the best part of the movie is the relation ship between tom(ben bratt) and patience/catwoman. it is very reminisant of the batwoman/selina/catwoman triangle! this i the element in the movie that is the most catwoman~esque. the way she toys with men, falling in love with them as her natural self but tormenting them as her alter cat-ego. there is avery good balance between the action and the story. one thing that really stands out in this movie is sharon stone! she is amazing! i only wish she had more screen time. many people are also complaining about the plot twist...i will not give it away even though you learn of it less than 10 mins in to the movie. i will defend it though. i think it is a very good plot that fits well with a female superhero, not that catwoman would have trouble taking on the likes of doc-OK or the joker...i just think the plot fits. the one thing i do think is horrible in this movie is the editing! critics are complaining about the editing, saying that it makes the action scenes not flow well enough or makes them to choppy...i disagree with that...the thing that really bothered me about the editing was this: in the beginning, patience goes to work...goes home and goes to bed...gets up and goes to work in the same cloths...this would have been an affective way of showing how sloppy the character is, to wear the same thing to work 2 days in a row, but when she gets to work, all of her cow workers have on the same things too? not only that, but they use the exact same shot when she goes into her office...a sweeping shot the goes from the building door, up a set of stairs, and into her cube. its not that they used the same camera angels or track, it is the exact same shot, same people doing the same things...EXACT SAME SHOT!it really buged me, but maybe it was just me. the theater i saw it in was very empty...maybe 20 other people. i was surprised how big of a reaction the movie got. people were laughing outloud and cheering for catwoman at a certain part!, myself included. when it was over people clapped for a good 2/3 mins! so it wasn't just me that really enjoyed it! i wouldn't be surprised it catwoman makes more in its second weekend than it did in its first, after word of mouth travels and people get over the change of history...it really is adequately explained! so...in conclusion...SEE CATWOMAN THE MOVIE.....SOON!"
2080,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"The picture talks on a vogue designer , Patience (Halle Berry) , who discovers a conspiracy by her chiefs (the cunning marriage : Sharon Stone and Lambert Wilson). She escapes dropping at the sea and for a spell of a holy cat , she is transformed and awakes with ultra-keen senses as Catwoman , including an extreme speed , agility and strength . A policeman (Benjamin Bratt) investigates odd murders that are leading to her , but they then fall in love . They'll have to confront several risks and dangers until the attaining of her innocence as a public criminal .

The picture has got a certain remembrance to last adaptations based on comic books , thus ¨Daredevil¨ and ¨Electra¨ but lack luster and budget . The movie mingles tension , action , humor , a love story and being enough amusing . From the beginning to finish the action-packed and suspense are continued and fast-moving and that's why it isn't tiring , neither boring , but fun . Over use of digital effects , though also were utilized 43 cats that trained for the film . The final duel between the starring and the baddies is impressive and exciting . The film obtained moderated success and the producers didn't achieve the wished box office and isn't sure if it will have a sequel . Thierry Arbogast cinematography is colorful and shimmer . Klaus Badlet score is nice and atmospheric but is shaded by a monotonous pop music . The motion picture was regularly directed by Pitof who his previous film , Vidoq , made it much better . In fact , this ¨Catwoman¨ achieved several Razzie Awards . Yarn will appeal to Halle Berry fans and superheroine comics enthusiast . Rating : mediocre and entertaining ."
2081,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"What a wonderful escape movie, for two hours I was transported to a world where impossible things can indeed happen. Halle Berry was very believable as the Catwoman and her beauty just added spice to the movie. I was also impressed with Benjamin Bratt, what a hunk, and with Sharon Stone as the villainess. The intense chemistry between Halle and Benjamin made the screen sizzled. The duality of Patience/Catwoman was interesting to view. What happens when a timid, shy woman gain strength and confidence in herself? That the answer that Halle portrays so well in the movie - it's a struggle between these two personalities before they merge into one exciting and mysterious woman still capable of displaying sensitivity and wonder. I can hardly wait for Catwoman "
2082,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Okay, a lot of you out there who hated this movie are going to think I'm a retard for loving it. But, ever since Michelle Pfeiffer donned the outfit in Batman Returns, I've fallen in love with the character, Catwoman. When I read about Angelina Jolie starring in the role 2 or 3 years before the movie's opening, I was ecstatic. Then, it switched to Nicole Kidman, and then Halle Berry. I was skeptical about how the movie was going to turn out, because at first the plot sounded dumb, and the outfit didn't impress me. After awhile, though I began to love the costume, and after seeing it on opening night, I've been completely obsessed. I've bought all the merchandise, the DVD (watched about 10 times since I bought it), and I believe it is one of the best movies ever! The plot is stupid, I'll admit, and Sharon's acting was terrible, as well as Lambert Wilson's, but I don't understand everyones hatred of Halle's. She was superb in playing all 3 roles in it, Patience, Patience/Catwoman, and Catwoman herself. The movie lines were campy, but who the hell cares, it is a fun action flick, and shouldn't receive all the hatred its getting. The people picking the razzies should take another look at the other loads of crap we got this year, such as Baby Geniuses 2, and Harold & Kumar (which I still don't understand why they made those pieces of crap). Also, everyone was saying how the CG was terrible, and how great Spiderman was. Take a look at the facts, Spiderman is completely covered from head to toe, of course he is going to look good in CG, as Catwoman is mostly skin-showing. I was also disappointed that it wasn't Selina Kyle, but after seeing the movie, it explains that there isn't just one Catwoman, there are many Catwomen, and I think people don't here that part, so they just keep on complaining about a Selina-less movie. Bottom line, it was a great movie, one of my favorite movie, the favorite actually."

2087,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Wow. I just watched this film on TV. I didn't pay to see it in theaters, although I am considering filing a lawsuit against my cable company for mental anguish. A friend and I decided to watch it on a whim and as the credits rolled my friend asked who wrote it, to which I replied ""You know, it's not always the writers fault."" This is true is is not always the writer who messes up a story. But in this case it is very much the writers fault. Our story follows Patience as she goes from lovable shy girl to CAT-woman. I use the capitals in the word CAT because the writers seemed to feel the need to impress upon the audience at every possible turn that she is now a CAT-woman. I got the feeling that our trio of would-be poets would have preferred to stand in theaters with baseball bats labeled ""CAT-woman"" which they would swing at any member of the audience who didn't seem to appreciate the blatant cat references and mannerisms of Ms. Berry while screaming ""GET IT? SHE'S A CAT! ISN'T THAT COOL??? SHE'S A CAT!"" if they had been given the opportunity. The ""cat-bat"" is swung so often in this movie I began to feel the need for a catchers mask. The story is poorly thought out and the plot seems merely designed to let us see Halle in the leather suit a few times to distract us from considering the money wasted making this piece of litter. Oh and not to spoil things but the police in the movie are morons of the highest caliber. When presented with clues in the form of a used glass with DNA, fingerprints which were all over the jewelry store, or some lipstick? If you said fingerprints you'd be wrong, just as wrong as this movie."
2088,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Bad... just bad... to the point that it couldn't even be considered remotely sexy or even remotely empowering for females.

..And Sharon Stone looks funny in a jumpsuit these days.

At the very least, this movie reminded me of why MST3K should still exist. My friends and I had a blast.

And another thing:

Why bother with CG cats??? They're relatively easy to train and oh-so-cuddly.

Did anyone else notice that 15.7% of the people who rated this movie gave it a 10?

I challenge anyone to redeem this movie for me. Please. Do it for the kitties.

I've heard the excuse that they didn't want to be tied to the Batman stories, but does that require tossing away everything?

Clearly, however, the bad decisions didn't stop with the first, and the horror continues all throughout the movie. The writing is painful and the acting even worse.

2090,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I do much prefer Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman,a manipulative character with a crave for jewellery, not emphasised enough in this instalment, but not entirely missed. Unlike some people, I liked Halle Berry in the title role, I liked the scene where she cuts off her hair and revealed her real self. Somehow she didn't look right with all that hair over her face. When she was Catwoman, she looked very sexy in that leather outfit. Now the script was weak at times, but I really liked the overall look of the film, with the splendid sets. The special effects were a bit ropey, and others where it looked part-animated, or like the Matrix, but they're weren't the weakest part of the movie, that was the script, which seemed rather muddled and trite. The supporting players, particularly Sharon Stone weren't that bad, and while slow-moving and predictable at times, neither was the plot.

Halle Berry doesn't even become Catwoman until about 1/2 hour into the movie. Its not just bad, ITS SLOW TOO! Not worth a rent, not worth watching on cable, and not even worth stopping on when flipping through the channels.

2096,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"The only thing good I have to say about this movie is that no matter what, Benjamin Bratt is a fox. I honestly believe the writers, producers and directors just figured they'd throw in a few sex symbols - Benjamin, Halle and Sharon - and the audience would overlook the travesty that was this film. But how stupid do they think we are??? Good Lord. They could as well have just dressed the three of them up in costumes and let them walk up and down a stage and it would have been much more entertaining than it actually was.

I'm sorry, because I love Halle, I love Benjamin, and I don't really mind Sharon, but honestly I think this movie was pointless, anti-climactic and uninspired. It took me two days to get through it, and it's an experience I would love to push out of my memory. As I was watching it I was just praying I would see a shot of a half-naked Benjamin Bratt so I'd feel as if I got at least a quarter of my money's worth. Well...I got like an arm and a bit of chest. At least the guys got to see Halle prance, strut and jump about in a skin-tight leather suit. That's the best I can say."

Subconsciously, this is your body using its animal instinct, fight or flight if you will, in an attempt to get as far away from this 'movie' as possible. This is the worst film ever made. Halle ""I won an Oscar for sleeping with Billy Bob Thornton on camera"" Berry pretends to act here, portraying Patience Phillips (Selina Kyle anyone?) a loser who works at an evil makeup company, wherein she stumbles upon an evil makeup plot by Sharon Stone and her evil homosexual sidekick. I guess it makes sense, especially to a man simply known as Pitof, who directed this mess. Direction would allude to clarity, which this film does not contain, most likely due to the fact that does not speak English. If he could, there is NO WAY that he would have read the script and felt that it was appropriate to go ahead and make this into a film. Lets not even get into specifics here, because the cinematography, soundtrack, CGI, and especially the acting is the worst I have ever seen. If you don't believe me watch the basketball scene and see if you don't want to hurt people. Watching this film is like someone punching your mother in the face. I tried, I desperately tried to finish the film twice, and neither time my intelligence and dignity simply wouldn't let me. Its just that bad. I could go on and on..... the scene where the cat lady explains to Halle that cats choose one woman like Neo from the Matrix and that cats are magic and whatever else was said while I wasn't paying attention....the laughable fight scenes, the fact that she becomes cat like and licks herself clean and chases crickets etc.... I'm mad at myself that I'm even writing this review, maybe its like Freddy Krueger and we can make it go away by not fearing it. Awful. Disgusting. Disgraceful to all of film. Catwoman."

I stand alone, I guess. I thought the movie was great.

Well, my wife saw it with me and she loved it too. I guess there's a reason we're married.

Most of the criticism I've read is pretty empty -- usually strings of pseudo-clever insults. So I can't really grasp what offended people so badly. The most specific complaint I've heard is that it's campy.

It's a COMIC BOOK movie, for heaven's sake! It's about a SUPER HERO (or super-anti-hero, if you will). It's like complaining that a war movie is violent. Sure, not for everyone -- but I think this movie is right there with X-Men and Spider-man as excellent comic adaptations.

The characters were entertaining and three dimensional. The script was sharp. The balance of action and humor was even. The pacing was tight. The cinematography was superb. The action sequences were not only technically well done, but even artistic. The acting was campy but not too over the top (as in moron flicks like Dungeon's & Dragons).

Okay -- I must sound like a boob to all the folks who hated this movie. But I'm actually a well rounded guy. I'm not some basement comic book aficionado. I do love Kubrik, Gilliam, Jeunet & Caro... maybe that's what it is. I'm into art cinema writ large, which seems to piss off a lot of people for some reason. And this film is the comic book version of that.

2104,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I had heard the most terrible things about this movie and being a lover of bad movies I decided to give it a try.

How is it?

Not good. Actually if you look at the film in pieces its pretty good, unfortunately you have to look at it all at once on the big screen, which means that this movie is a car wreck.

The film looks good. Pitof, the director, is a former visual effects director so he knows how to make things look good. I love his first feature, Vidocq, and this film reminds me of that film with its wild moving camera, but here it doesn't always work. I have the sense that Pitof knew it wasn't going to work and got lost in his own thing.

The biggest flaw in this film is the script. The writing is cartoony, but not real. Everything that is said and happens seems off the rack as if this was put together by committee. Actually that's what I think happened, everyone putting in something but allowing no central vision to hold it all together. My guess it was the studio heads who really were calling the shots and putting things together according to a check list. Bad mistake since nothing fits together except fleetingly. The acting is okay, but the central casting of Halle Berry was wrong. She's not bad, indeed she is hyper-sexy at times, but she doesn't come across as tough as she really should. She comes off like a young girl playing dress up, who knows none of it is real. Thats great if you're in a bedroom, but not when we have to feel for our heroine.

I don't blame her, someone should have seen that she wasn't working and removed her. Its not her fault that she isn't believable since she gives it her best shot. She has to learn to pick her roles or her career is over.

This is a film made by a group of talented people who should have known better. They should have seen this wasn't working and corrected it before it was too late.

3 out of 10.

PS Sharon Stone is too good as the villain. She may end up in danger of being typecast not only in her career but in life as well."
2105,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Dear Ms. Halle Berry:

After watching Gothika earlier this year I wrote you a letter detailing my bewilderment with your film choices after so historically taking home an Academy Award for your role in Monster's Ball. My letter detailed how I felt you should have used your new bargaining power to solidify yourself amongst the great non-white actors of any era.

I can only assume that my letter did not hit its target as I have just had the displeasure of watching your new big screen dud, Catwoman.

Let me first say that I was intrigued upon first hearing about the role and when I saw the production stills of you in your Catwoman outfit, I became rather weak at the knees. After seeing your body in Monster's Ball and in Swordfish, I had the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end at the notion of you in a leather outfit with strategic rips throughout and a whip that would make you my first call of choice had I ever been in peril and needed a superhero s.t.a.t.

I wasn't keen on the Catwoman character however. I was a religious watcher of the campy Batman television serial and the Catwoman villain as played by Julie Newmar and perfected by Ertha Kitt and I thought Catwoman was best on a show that didn't take itself seriously as, let's face it, having claws and a whip as your weapons of choice are kinda comical.

But a funny thing happened, Michelle Pfeiffer had a kick at the suit in 1992's Batman Returns and although the movie was a major disappointment and the character still seemed stale, I was at least intrigued by the woman behind the suit.

To make a long letter shorter, I then held out the smallest glimpse of hope for your entry. Then I had the unfortunate occurrence of seeing the trailer. What led you to this role I wondered. The script revealed nothing that would lead me to believe that this was a good career choice. In short, a woman who is the prettiest, most polite individual this side of both oceans, happens upon a corporate conspiracy of her employer, Hedare Beauty. A result of her findings, she is left for dead, but resurrects as someone who feels comfortable wearing leather and donning nails that leave marks on lovers that would make Freddy Krueger weep in appreciation. After settling a few gripes, she goes after the corporation heads while trying to maintain a relationship with her new boyfriend cop played rather naively by Benjamin Bratt.

Hmm, a revenge film where someone comes back from near death to use their new athletic ability acquired in their coma state into a world of hurt for all those that get in the way. Well, that has never been done before has it?

For the first time in almost five months, the theatre patrons did not bug me during your film. Usually, I am the unlucky sonofabitch that always seems to find the group of people either in front or behind that have no theatre manners. Just my luck, during Catwoman, the audience was silent (except of course for the roar of laughter that I am sure was unintended at certain points in the movie). Maybe in awe of the sheer audaciousness of the venture or maybe showing signs of embarrassment for you, barely a snore could be heard. I have never so much wanted to listen to someone talk about his or her golf game on the weekend during a film in many many a cat's life.

So, Ms. Berry before I wrote you regarding my lack of understanding as to your choices. This time, I am writing to you asking for my money back. The only good thing in Catwoman is your outfit and you took too long to adorn said costume. The special effects were the jerkiest I have seen this side of the new millennium and had it not been for Sharon Stone and a few good biting comments, I probably would have used my pen to start slashing the screen. Not being able to blame the director (someone named Pitof that had as much experience behind the camera as I have had between the sheets), I must apply the full 100% of my angst towards you.

I leave it here at peace in hopes that Catwoman does not have 9-lives. From the reaction to the audience, I expect this made-for-Mystery-Science-Theatre waste of time will end up on video before you could lick up a bowl of milk with your hands behind you back.

Come to think of it, THAT I would have paid for.

Mostly due to Halle Berry's representation as Catwoman, different characters, different storyline from the Batman comic books, and the overtly sexual Catwoman costume. But to be honest, I actually liked it a lot. I watched this movie about 10 times and never got tired of it. Even though it's definitely not one of the best DC movies out there, it's definitely worth watching in my opini"
2107,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I enjoyed this film. It's not the greatest but it was a hell of a lot more watchable than its current IMDb of 3.3 suggest so no qualms about giving it a tactical 10 to bump it up a bit.

The problem as such? I'm going to come right out and say it - this is a chick's version of a superhero movie. Catwoman is not really macho, she's not really that violent. The subplot is about personal growth but not in the becoming a demigod or Bruce Wayne to batman way. ...By the end of the film catwoman character ""knows herself"". That could only count as a finale in a female oriented movie! Having said that - I'm not blind - it is a fairly weak movie. In truth probably say 5.5 on IMDb norms. I think the reason it gets marked down is the disappointment of the fanboys that all the usual male-oriented themes are missing. That's why it equally erroneously gets a 1 so often - just disappointment and a bit of how dare you mess with ""our"" DC universe.

Well don't believe that nonsense. It wasn't great but it was bad either and I was mildly entertained. Just watch it."
2108,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Wow, does Halle Berry brings life to this character in a way I have never seen Catwoman. I could feel her power radiate off the screen. When it was over I wanted to see it over and over. She had her body and her mind right in the character. This Catwoman, Halle Berry, will always be known for her walk/prowl.

2110,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I only just got to see this movie. I had heard and read negative comments about the movie so I wasn't expecting much. Turns out these so called critics are really just asking for the wrong movie, so please follow the detour.

I like Cats. This Movie dishes out a lot of the subtle Cat-like stereotypes in the form of a woman - Catwoman. To me it seemed like candy with extra sweetening, my favorite animal + gorgeous woman = Something worth watching.

Sure the plot wasn't some deep and meaningful drama, but I don't believe I was ever lead to the expectation it was supposed to. This is about the lifestyle of a Cat, and a Woman's assimilation into that lifestyle.

2111,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Moonlighting from the X-Men movies, Halle Berry unwisely portrays a shy, downtrodden advertising artist who gets stepped on by virtually everyone. When she finds out that the makeup firm she works for is planning to release a toxic skin cream that makes people ill if they don't keep using it, her bosses - Sharon Stone and that smug French guy from the Matrix sequels, conspire to have her bumped off, and she ends up drowning in raw sewage. She then reemerges as a ""cat woman"", with super agility and strength to rival that of Spider-Man or the Crow, and more ferocious personality, which she compliments by going with a short butch haircut instead of her initial long curly locks, and starts running around in a hooker/porn outfit with a whip and begins beating up people. Naturally, she's looking for revenge, but falling in love with cop Benjamin Bratt complicates things.

Like so many others, my mind is boggled as to how this piece of crap came to fruition. The plot is horrible, the dialogue and acting laughably bad, and the special effects and action sequences pitiful. There are no words out there that can sufficiently describe this failure among failures. True the film has problems that extend well beyond her, but Halle Berry, a former Oscar winner, is simply terrible in this film - and no, showing off how great she looks on the edge of 40 does not redeem her for this piece of junk (either they offered her too much money or she was so depressed over her divorce she just didn't care what the work was as long as it got her away from home and her troubles). Hell, Benjamin Bratt probably gave the film's best performance, and he was stuck playing the hapless love interest/boy toy cop.

In closing, this piece of crap makes other similarly crappy films like ""King Arthur"" look good by comparison (and KA was awful)."

2118,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I have seen the dreadful reviews involving this film, from critics & viewers alike, as well as noticing how it had crashed at the box office. So because of this have avoided it. Tonight was one of those nights when nothing was on, so I decided I might as well watch this movie which was on satellite and at least get a laugh if nothing else.

I am glad I did, as surprising enough it is nowhere as bad as people have made it out to be, and is above average in the comic book stakes. This is from someone who has seen quite a few over the years, some atrociously bad. This isn't one of them. The acting is passable for this sort of film, with Sharon Stone making a good villain, though not in it enough, and Halle Berry is worth a mark alone for her sex appeal. She is in fact more sensual when she is not in her bat costume, and unlike Jennifer Lopez can act with more than her posterior. The plot is okay, though I do agree with people when they say Cat Woman doesn't seem to have any sense of purpose. The effects are okay, but are average for this type of film, and I can only conclude, that a lot of the negativity for this film comes from the this. If there isn't a city being blown up & millions of casualties, these people are never satisfied.

Oh well I liked it, and the cats were great."
2119,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"There have been a lot of bad press and even worse reviews about this movie. I liked it. Why did I like it? I found it to be one of the most unique and visually entertaining movie I have ever seen. Most of the people who are giving this movie bad ratings are people who went into it with bad blood for it, so they looked for anything they could to rip it apart.

That had to be the case, because the movie that I saw was amazing. It was NOT Batman & Robin, like a lot of people are saying. It takes a simple concept and does so much with it. The creators of this film do so much with what they are given. The characters, unlike what previous posters have said, are very well developed, and there is much raw emotion displayed, especially between Halle and Benjamin, who fit together in this movie like hand in glove. And Sharon plays the baddest b-word you've ever seen!

Over all, this movie is a weird but creative combination between Ready to Wear, Spider-Man 2, Batman Returns, The Matrix, Batman Forever, City of Lost Children, Batman, and The Crow. Everything is satisfying in this film, even the music. I can't describe what a treat this film was, just because it was so unique. My advice is to go see it yourself. You may like it, you may not.

It's all about your expectations, seriously did anyone really expect Catwoman to be a masterpiece in cinema history? Didn't think so! I won't deny i would have liked a little more than Catwoman ultimately delivers, but it isn't deserving of the poor rating is has here.

I agree that this is probably Sharon Stone's worst performance, cheesy lines don't don't suit her ability, but i thought that Halle Berry did a fine job as Catwoman, she got in to the role and did her best, despite some lame dialogue. The special effects equal spider-man's easily, as you should expect, and some of the action scenes are pretty good, sadly some are pretty bad too.

All in all the movie is below the standard it could, or even should be, but to give it a score of 1 is too harsh. It does entertain, and it only missed my expectations by a little (i didn't expect that much anyway) Watch it if you want too, it's not all bad.

2126,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"The title says it all! I missed Catwoman on the big screen for whatever reason. I first saw it on DVD in mid-1996. I liked it so much I went out and bought a DVD copy of my own. I am at a loss as to why so many people feel the need to blast this movie; the acting, casting, direction were all good. OK, the plot wasn't brilliant but then, when was the last time Hollywood produced anything (and I mean anything) brilliant? I am sure the reason so many people were upset with the movie was that it varied from the comic book - Selina Kyle mythology. The problem with comic book movies is that they are going to be seen by comic book readers and therein lies the problem: comic book readers have little or no imagination. Why else do they read books full of pictures? The Selina Kyle model was boring and barely worked as a Batman spin-off. Why would anyone want to see a movie about a ""normal"" chick whose only claim to fame is that she dresses up like a cat. The studio's decision to create a whole new Catwoman with actual cat-based superpowers was a great one and made for a much more interesting movie.

Halle Berry was fantastic as Catwoman. The dejectors can say what they like (and they already have), but Halle was awesome. The Catwoman costume was very creative as well. The combination of Halle Berry in the Catwoman costume was unbelievable - veeeerrry sexy.

Whilst Catwoman was not the best flick ever made, it is far from the worst. If you have bever seen it, pick up a copy next time you visit the DVD library. It is certainly well worth a look."

Because I base what I'm going to see on the reviews of IMDB, I was going to take a pass on Catwoman. After all, I've never been led astray by IMDB.

My wife, a Berry fan, wanted to see it and since I'd seen everything else that was fit to be see (per IMDB) I decided to score a few points with the Missus by going. I kept my expectation low which was the best thing I could do since the only way to go is up. After watching it, I now know why the ratings were so low. All the purist DC comic fans were upset because they expected Michelle Pfeiffer and instead got Halle Berry. (The geeks that read the comic books. I happen to be a comic geek, but I understand that the formula can't always be followed -- so I try to keep an open mind.)

Ok, ok, so it doesn't follow the Batman series created by Bob Kane. Who says it has to? It had decent action and fairly simple story. (This story doesn't take a lot of brainpower to follow). We don't have Selina Kyle, but Patience Phillips a young artist stuck in a job drawing ads for Cosmetics Company. A rather wimpy character (ala Peter Parker)  She's a doormat for everyone around her. Then, she sees something that she's not supposed to. Bad guys try to take her down then, BAM - POW, an accident happens. Cat brings her back. (The resurrection of Phillips is a little lame, but, hey, this is based upon a comic book universe. Don't expect much). Now, the formally meek Phillips comes out of her 'cage' looking for revenge on the people that 'killed' her.

I didn't walk out wishing for 2 hours of my life back. It could have been much worse. Go to this movie, forget about the comic books and enjoy a fairly decent show. The kids will like it and so should the men. Of course, when you return, input an honest vote. It doesn't deserve to be a 2.7 on a 10 scale. Maybe 5.5 out of 10, but not 2.7."
2134,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I actually liked the movie, Cat Woman! What made the movie fun for me was the great deal of energy that Halle Berry put into the role. Yeah, I know the plot was a bit weak, with the corrupt cosmetics company trying to line its pockets at the expense and health of its customers. So what, if we hurt our customers, as long as we line our pockets and make lots of money!

Halle Berry, as the timid ad worker, meekly tries to tell her noisy neighbors to be quiet. So meek, that no one can even hear her. When she became Cat Woman by a chemical accident, she boldly went over to her neighbor's loft to tell them to shut up! She even sprayed them with a water/soda hose.

Halle Berry puts a lot of energy in this role, toying with the bad guys, and intensely eating fish with her boyfriend at a restaurant.

And for the record, there is never a time when Halle is on screen that should be classified as being boring or UN-entertaining. Yes the story was weak and the other actors were not up to par, but Halle was not ""awkwardly cast as the lead.""

2141,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"So, to curb the success of all MArvel-comic-based movies, a ""Catwoman"" movie was made. The result? Stick to Marvel, you won't be disappointed.

Halle Berry plays Patience Phillips, a submissive artist working for a beauty company. On the same day, she is asked out by a cop (Benjamin Bratt - ""Demolition man""), is threatened with the sack by her boss (Lambert Wilson), saved by the sack by her boss' wife (SHARON STONE!!!!!) and hears too much of something and ends up... dead. Only that a cat breathes into her (""make me real, bring me to life""... Evanescence made that first, I think). She becomes Catwoman, and her character changes completely, and goes for revenge.

The movie is boring, pointless and weak. Rather than picking an actress to reprise Selina Kyle (original name), they chose the actress of the moment, regardless of the fact that CW was white, and changed everything(bah, compared to what I recall from ""Batman Returns"") Halle was fine as Patience, awful as the Catwoman, but her little ass looks great in leather.

I should give it a 0 but the minimum is 1, and also, I had the chance to see actors I don't see very often like Byron Mann, or Peter Wingfield. Watch it, merely to see her in leather. Only that is worth it.

Sharon stone did her best but the character was laughable and although Halle berry looked really good she just wasn't right for this part.

Another failing was the choice of director, someone who has only directed music videos should not have been given the helm of a movie that on paper had a lot of promise.

The special effects also left a lot to be desired, in a year in which we were given the fantastic comic book movie ""Spiderman 2"", the effects of ""catwoman"" jumping around the city looked like they had been created years previously.

And the CG was not up to the task. Dumb story, dialogue sounding like it was written by a seventh grader, bad directing, bad editing, bad acting, awful and inappropriate music, and a ridiculous catwoman mask. It's completely unwatchable. Even Halle Berry's beautiful face, sexy body and round booty would not justify a five minute look.

Catwoman's major problems are that it doesn't have much of a sense of humor (I don't recall laughing), it's the wrong time to be a pretentiously single-named french director, and it's a bit flat. Complaints that the plot is silly, are lost on me when a scientist with 4 robotic arms is considered terrific. Others hate superhero moves because they waste too much time on the ""origin"" storyline. Are they better when they jump directly to the hackneyed evil scientist (Alfred Molina) plot line? Some complain that the special effect are bad. Well, Spidermans swinging and tumbling through New York looks emphatically phony & cheesy to me also. Catwoman is shallow, but it's nowhere near as bad as the uniformly bad reviews whine.

For me, Spiderman 2 lacked any of the depth or values that everyone gushed about. I cannot stand the constant idiotic stupor on Tobey Maquire's face. Kirsten Dunst majorly sucks as an actress and the plot & villain were at least as stupid as any other. I am thoroughly ****ing tired of girlfriends who are models and actresses.

I think that our friend PITOF (what sort of name is this!?) probably opened the Lost Ark and filmed its content, that's the only explanation. I saw ""Ninja Force"", ""Psychocop"", ""Dreamcatcher"", ""Tank Girl"" and the worst peat of all time (until now), ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"", and, all you MST3k fans out there like me, I'm sorry to inform, this IS the WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.

2149,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Usually, when you watch a movie with a bad reputation, you're pleasantly surprised. Or else, that means the movie is VERY bad (Judge Dredd, for example). Don't worry, unlike IMDb's infame-ous troll (I won't say his name but his initials are SV), I won't try to pretend Catwoman is the best superhero movie on the market. That would be a lie. But at least, it's watchable. I found myself watching it from the beginning to the end without feeling bored, despite the many plot holes and continuity errors.

So, what are Catwoman good parts? 1-The opening credits, with clippings and articles about cats and the previous Catwomen (I don't think Pitof directed it, since there's a similar scene in the movie which is poorly edited). 2-There are a few beautiful shots: the very first scene, an underwater shot of Patience, alas spoiled by a stupid voice-over; or the two shots of Catwoman in front of the moon. 3-The first Catwoman costume. The one she's wearing during the jewelry's heist. How come they thought the atrocious second costume was better? 4-Halle Berry. Like Helen Slater for Supergirl, Halle was blamed for Catwoman's failure while she was the only actress who took the project seriously and gave us a convincing acting, both as Patience and as Catwoman. She did the best she could with the script and truly didn't deserved her razzie.

The bad parts? 1-Pitof! He's unquestionably the worst director on the market! This man knows nothing about storytelling, using a dozen of shots when one would be sufficient, and sometimes filming everything except what is happening. Most of the fighting scenes are confusing since it's hard to figure what's going on. 2-The CGIs! As someone already noted, the best CGis are on par with Spider-Man's worst. Worst of all, they were used for scenes that would have looked better with trained animals, animatronics, stunt women and wire works. 3-The promotion. First, they pretended Catwoman was a serious movie with a message about female empowerment. When the movie bombed at the US box office but was about to be released in other countries, they said it was an humorous, tongue-in-check movie, not to be taken seriously (And note how Pitof, after telling everyone he had never read anything about the comic's Catwoman, was then pretending he has been a fan of the comic for years!). Unfortunately, Catwoman was none of both, so the spectators were disappointed in both cases. Not to mention the trailers only used the corniest scenes and dialogs of the movie. 4-The main villain. It would have been a great plot twist if Laurel was first shown as a likable allie for Catwoman, while her husband looked like the real villain (according to earlier Sharon's interviews, it seems it was the original intent). Unfortunately, she's immediately revealed as the main villain. Another problem is the villain in a good superhero movie must be a) someone with powers or abilities that made him equal or superior to the main character (Zord, Joker, Selena, Magneto, Green Goblin, Dr Octopus), b) someone smart enough to find the main character's weaknesses and use them to get the upper hand on him (Lex Luthor, Top Dollar); in both case: someone that can be a match for the hero(in). What are Laurel's powers? She can't be wounded. That's all. She get her indestructible ass kicked for about 3 minutes, get the upper hand for a few second, then get her ass kicked again and die. What a looser! I think it would have been better if the writers had made her a former Catwoman gone bad, with the same powers than Patience.

All in all, it's a movie that is watchable... on TV! This way, you don't get your guilty pleasure spoiled by the thought that you gave money for seeing this."

2151,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I enjoyed this movie, and am not ashamed to say so. It is independent of the Batman+Catwoman tradition, so if you expected that type of film you'll be disappointed. It stands alone, and only flaw I could detect was that cat, Midnight, was an obvious computer-animation at one significant juncture - but even this can be forgiven. Hence, for sheer entertainment, I give this movie 9 out of 10. It is a cartoon-creation and not to be taken too seriously, hence cardboard cut-out characters, and corny dialogue; but such is permissible in this kind of film. If this movie happened to flop at the box office, I'd claim it's not the film's fault, but more a stupid and unreasoning bandwagon chorus of condemnation. This is a super heroine movie and not inferior to others of its type - if you judge it purely on its own merits. The story is easy to follow, music and sound effects blend in well, and computer-animation supports the story and doesn't overpower it. All actors do a good job. The whole is a pleasant experien"
2152,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"We have seen a lot of comic books movies these past years, and I enjoyed most of them. I liked X Men 1 and 2, spiderman 1 and 2, daredevil and hulk. But what is this ? What is this terrible thing that call itself a movie ?

A woman dressed like a SM hooker climb the walls like a diarrhea suffering spiderman.

The plot is awful and has nothing to do with the original comic : the heroin should avenge her own death and stop the evil plots from a cosmetic industry !

The dialogs are pathetic and the acting game ridiculous from Halle Berry to Sharon Stone.

And the FX ? They are as bad as the rest. Every CGI is so badly made that it reminded me the terrible game sequences insertion in house of the dead !"
2153,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Aside from the absolutely Heinous costume design, awful plot and disgraceful acting on all accounts...oh wait - that's right - there was no redeeming quality to this movie. Even the fight scenes were not interesting at all and the camera work was sickeningly bad at times. As this abomination of modern cinema went on the only way it amazed me was by how much worse it could possibly get - only topping itself. Halle Berry was weak at best and Benjamin Bratt came up with the worst acting I've seen in about 3 years.

The plot only made things worse. WATCH OUT! KILLER FACE CREAM ON THE LOOSE! Can you get any more idiotic? I think not. Catwoman herself was not at all the bad-ass character she should have been, and only succeed in looking like a cross breed between a conehead and a goth. This movie is an embarrassment to the screen.

2154,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Catwoman is not a film that is out to change the world or send any kind of a message. I was expecting a HORRIBLE film when I went to see this based on the reviews I have read on IMDb but I was pleasantly surprised. Halle Berry makes a fantastic Catwoman. No not as good as Michelle Pffiefer but good nonetheless. Benjamin Bratt and Halle have a fun chemistry. The weak point in this film is in my opinion the villain or lack there of. Sharon Stone is simply not good in this and she brings the movie down. So yes Sharon sucks but stop the Halle bashing as she does just fine in her role. They should have created a more dynamic more threatening villain than a superficial cosmetics diva whose hubby is stepping out. Could have been better but not ""awful"

I don't think it's anywhere near the worst movie to be rated, so I am surprised by the votes that this has received. I think there are things that could be been better (supporting cast, Ben Bratt taking his shirt off more, a more believable evil plot than cosmetics) but for what I paid, it was fun and campy. I think that for the camp value alone of Sharon Stone, this should be seen.

2157,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I don't care what the critics say and before anyone accuses me of never having read the comics, I have. And hey, it's not true to the books, but I don't care, I think it's a great movie. It was slick and well done. The villains were suitably campy comic book villains; Halle Berry lit up the screen in her portrayal of both Catwoman and Patience. The filming was great and the whole look of the movie invoked a sort of comic book type picture. The stunts were great, and even if the story is a tad weak, it's a great movie to look at. And to those who say the suit is all wrong, just look at how good it looks on Berry, I don't think there'll be many arguments there. The chemistry between Bratt and Berry was fantastic, (especially in the basketball scene). My only complaint was that Halle cut her gorgeous curls of"
2158,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"but I liked Catwoman, and don't understand how all these reviews are trashing it. I was expecting the worst because when it was in theaters it was trashed. But, after watching it, I thought it was better than I lot of movies now days. Sure, you must suspend a lot of reality in order to believe that Patience could be brought back to life by the soul of an ancient cat, but I thought it was explained so it made some sense. I didn't think the idea for the evil villain being selling a cream that makes someone's skin rot if they stop using it was a great idea. They could have come up with a better plot there. But, I liked how Patience doesn't remember and must investigate her own ""death."" Plus, it was great seeing the independence personality trait of a cat coming out of her. Like when she finally decides to break up the noisy party across the street. That was great.

You could tell when it was the computer Catwoman, but it was not used excessively. I liked all the cat like fights and one liners by Hallie. I especially liked the fight between Catwoman and Tom behind the stage. She says I don't come when called, only when I want. Just like a cat.

Catwoman needed to use her whip more. And I don't understand all negative talk about Hallie's costume. I thought it was hot and slick. And what was up with Sharon Stone's face. It's like they use so much pancake make-up so you can't even see one wrinkle, or maybe they are just trying to hide plastic surgery scars. She really is starting to look like an alien. Why can't she just accept her age and stop trying to dress like a 20 year old.

FINAL VERDICT: I liked Catwoman and I'm also a cat lover, so maybe that has something to do with it. While the plot wasn't the best, I thought the action scenes and feline one-liners was good. I recommend it."
2159,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I went to see Batman Begins today and was shocked to see that Catwoman had only 3.4 compared to Batman Begins's 8.something. I had a lot more fun watching Catwoman because I think that's what the producers had in mind when they made it, a fun movie. But not only is it fun, it has a lot of good action, the movie moves along at a good pace, keeps you involved and gives you a lot of laughs when you need them. In my opinion these superhero movies should be like the comic books they came from, easy to look at, simple yet detailed story and most importantly, FUN. The Hulk, Spiderman, Daredevil, and Catwoman all did a great job of bringing the comic books to li"
2160,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I have not read a ton of comics that this character appears in, but I do know enough about her to realize that she's pretty far from this portrayal. However, that alone is not necessarily a negative, unless you are looking for a depiction that follows the source material, in which case, you should know up front, this ain't it. It can be justified to alter fiction over time. This flick serves a couple of purposes, although not one of them was intentional. The two most obvious being revealing that, in spite of the undeniable appeal, a sexy woman behaving in a cat-like manner can actually make her less attractive; and proving that Pitof, as I realized when I watched Vidocq, has absolutely no business directing. He can do FX, few problems there. Meanwhile, any movie he does is going to be driven by the special effects(which are frankly, terrible at times in this), and otherwise be flat and soulless. I mean it, compare any frame of this to that of Batman Returns, when Pfeiffer is on-screen. I've got no issue with Berry, or her skin color. She's done pretty good acting elsewhere. And she definitely looks hot, and not only in this. Here, you too often have to look past the ridiculous things they have her do, right down to numerous of her movements. Burton's transformation sequence was Gothic and disturbing... this one is silly, plain and simple. Meet Patience Philips. She is sad. That does not appear to stem from her fashion sense being arrested sometime in the 80's and continuing to be held for questioning... no, it's because she's mousy and scared. Then... actually, I'll spare you the details. A lot of the plot is beyond ludicrous, and this thing gets stupider the further it goes. The basket scene does add some weight to any insistent arguing that said sport... and indeed, many others that involve men and balls... are homo-erotic. Acting tends to be poor. Merv from the Matrix sequels is here, playing his role in that same way, presumably because it was not believed that American audiences could handle a foreigner doing 2 completely different performances in as many years. The fight scenes are OK. There's actually a decent idea here and there in this. The comedy is never funny. The title female is overly powerful, and nothing particularly threatens her. They go to great lengths to make her seem like a superhero, because, to Hollywood, ambiguity is a city in Russia. I recommend this solely to those with low standards, and anyone wishing to witness Halle embarrass herself. 1/10"
2161,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"It's not even bad enough to be good. It's pure junk food that will distract your senses for a split second and encourage you to perhaps buy an over-priced bowl of popcorn. Amazingly bad. My friend had to tell me the premise ""Sharon Stone invented a facial product that will destroy your face if you stop using it."" I had to ask him to repeat it. No way did they spend $85 million dollars to base a movie on that premise. No chance. That's simply obscene. It's stupid. It's beyond base. But yes. Now, did the producers pick three writers randomly off the L.A. Metro and force them to decide on the premise before the next stop? What was their first choice? ""Act 1: Catwoman gets feline leukemia and must save herself by traveling into the sun for radiation treatment..."" This is a classic case of giving a project too much money and allowing utter amateurs to get behind and in front of the camera. Every scene was framed and executed with the absolute minimum of forethought. It was as though this had no development time. But I expect it had too much development time. Everyone said their piece, hundreds of opinions were sorted through and lastly, no one was satisfied. When the script started to suffer they hired another writer to help. Then the lawsuits started. So they split the credit but no one wanted or was able to IMPROVE THE SCRIPT. I guarantee the writers lost jobs because of this junk. The producer is probably delivering mail in Glendale. With $85 million dollars they made a movie that is not watchable except in the most vegetative state. It is distracting like chicken mcnuggets. You eat one and forget you ate it. Ten minutes later you wish you had eaten a carrot. A simple carrot. Or, out of respect for catwoman, a sardine."

2163,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"The main reason I wanted to see Catwoman so bad was because of all the negative buzz; I wanted to see what it is about this movie that was so terrible that it created the biggest ""this movie sucks"" consensus since Gigli. Having watched it with the lowest of expectations, I have to say - this was not the rancid piece of muck I expected.

To my surprise, behind the stereotypical characters and formulaic superhero plot structure, lies a pretty well made piece of trashy entertainment. True, the script follows the formula to a ""T"" and borrows heavily from pretty much every other superhero film since Batman, but due to its flamboyant Fifth Element-ish style, its shameless over-the-topness, its slick visuals and some rockin' action sequences, the film somehow worked for me. There was even something charming about its naiveté; I could totally imagine the creators sitting in the editing room, nodding to themselves and saying, ""Wow, this is some damn good stuff,"" only to be caught off-guard later when the reviews came in.

Halle Berry, who I usually dislike, is quite delightful here, going all out and not shying away from the hammy style of the film. Face it, it takes some balls for an actor to deliver a line like ""What a PURRRRRfect idea!"" while keeping a straight face. She's really giving it all she's got. What's more, I enjoyed seeing the change in her body language from shy nerd to an actual cat - most of the cat-like gestures were extremely convincing.

I think the strongest thing going for the film is its editing and sense of rhythm. Think of the action sequences like really well made music videos, and I think you'll be able to enjoy them as much as I did. I especially liked the scene in the opera (or whatever), with the swinging lights - beautiful art direction. The film's technical aspects alone are reason enough to see it (I LOVED the wacky camera movements!).

To conclude, yes, the movie is shallow, formulaic and predictable, and you can easily make fun of most of the dialog and find the movie ridiculous if you want to. But if you approach it with an unbiased attitude, and you enjoy hamminess and camp, you'll find Catwoman to be an enjoyable and technically superb film."
2164,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I just rented this film on DVD and I liked it a lot. I find it a perfectly satisfying re-telling of the Catwoman story, performed by an original director with visual poetry and musical flair and interpreted by a very talented actress. The only thing that I find mysterious about this film is the savage beating it took from critics, starting with the big CACA (Chicago Authority on Cinematic Art) Roger Ebert. The critics can't agree among themselves why they hate this film so much: some say it is too CGI-dependent, others that it doesn't have enough special effects. Some critics find that the character demeans women. Others that she is too much of a feminist. One critic even accuses it of ""stealing"" from ""Spiderman 2"". Others find it too sexy, others not sexy enough. Some say it's ""tired"" and unoriginal. Others say it is too original. Collectively, the critics sound like Cinderella's wicked step-sisters and make just about as much sense.

One thing everybody seems to agree on is that the script-writers shouldn't have messed with the so-called original story from ""Batman"". It would seem that most film critics in America today grew up reading superhero comics and that they consider this form of literature holy writ that should never, ever be altered. This, of course, ignores the fact that in the course of 50 years, the character of Catwoman has been re-written and re-designed every two weeks or so by various people with various agendas. The fact that this latest incarnation is profoundly feminist goes a long way in explaining why a lot of critics (mostly semi-literate, overgrown teen-age boys with masturbatory fantasies of a pliant and preternaturally sexy Catwoman) are now spitting hairballs and having hissy fits.

Of course, the fact that the director Pitof, is a foreigner with a strange, unfamiliar name, and a Frenchman to boot, does not help his cause. Never mind that he was Jean-Pierre Jeunet's artistic director for years or that he authored the screen's first all-digital feature film (""Vidocq"") ahead of ""Episode II"". All those Frenchmen should be deported anyway after the way they behaved about the holy war in Iraq, right? The beating this film got is also a particularly underhanded way for White middle-class bigots to get back at an ""uppity"" Black actress whom they believe should never have gotten an Oscar because she is so pretty (and wears such ""immoral"" outfits). End of story. Thank God Ms. Berry has a sense of humour and will survive all of this"
2165,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"In light of my readings of other peoples' comments on Catwoman, I thought that I was prepared for the worst. Though a few people did note that the movie wasn't actually that bad. I can only assume that these are the cousins and uncles of Halle Berry, the producer and the rest of the crew's ilk, trying to pull a vicious joke on my behalf! The reason for the movie's score being so horrendous is VERY justified! To put it mildly.

Halle Berry is supposed to be a frightened little girl without style, and in becoming Catwoman, she suddenly gets ""balls"" and style. Overnight! Wow! I loved what Tim Burton did in Batman with the Joker and his evil regime, this worked perfectly because the world surrounding the evil empire that the Joker built, matched. But HOW THE HELL DID anybody get the idea that An Evil Empire of Cosmetics, producing addictive and acid-like creams and potions, would ever seem remotely credible.

Basically, just see the beginning and when she ""dies"" the mish-mash animated cats bringing Halle Berry back to life, sets the setting for the rest of the movie. And the amazing thing is that it is running on my TV right now, and I some horrified that I needed to post this for you. Now I will turn it off and NOT SEE the remaining 45 minutes, because I have some trash to take down, clothes to wash and other daily chores that suddenly have become violently important."

Berry saves the day by manifesting a luxuriously sexy amble and, thanks to special effects, doing the snazziest things in her feline S&M outfit. Granted, the fracas between Berry and Stone is inevitably a standard cat fight ho-hum, but what do makers of movies care? They rag on big business - will you believe that a company of awesome influence will inflict a hideously disfiguring beauty cream upon America's women and not expect within days that everyone will know and the game will be over? - because that's how the teeny weeny family businesses that are the Hollywood studios are: so furious at those mean big businesses destroying our nation - and they know if a sexy booty can be shaken, an otherwise ridiculous film may trium"

The funny thing is that while so many fanboys are crying that the film does a dis-service to Catwoman, the comics themselves have explored the what-ifs of a super powered Catwoman.

The movie is fast-paced and easy to get into. The camera angles and special effects paid off. When you see Catwoman in this film, she truly is human cat. The critics were wrong on this one. Please check this film out, it's worth your attention. I'm definitely getting the DVD, and I did pay to see it, and I'm not sorry I did so.

2173,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"It's got to take a lot of cheese for DC Comics to discreetly distance itself from one of its if not main then certainly most iconic characters. It took Michelle Pfeiffer's equally iconic portrayal of the Selina Kyle/Cat Woman character in Tim Burton's excellent ""Batman Returns"" to bring the idea of a Cat Woman film to the forefront. What might have sound like an appealing proposition back in 1992 somehow didn't feel as relevant more than a decade later. And for good reason...

The shy Patience Phillips stumbles upon the dirty secrets of her employer and gets killed for it. Not to worry though since she's brought back to life by some cat/deity of some kind and is reborn as the ballsy Catwoman so she can get an hair do, go shopping, do a bit of clubbing and incidentally find out who killed her and why... Oh and then she meets some generically good looking cop along the way... Vengeance and impossible love story ensues. The end. No, I mean it: the end.

Everything about ""Catwoman"" smells like left overs, the remains of a Sunday dinner stretched into a Monday casserole, exhausted from having been tried and done so many times before and bloated out of all proportions with stupidity and pointlessness so the script would be slightly thicker than a RSPCA leaflet. It would be very difficult to single out one particularly bad aspect of ""Catwoman"" from another as they are effectively interwoven into a complete disaster. This is such a formulaic Hollywood product that everything about its story (or lack of thereof) mired with plot holes the size of Australia is already known to whoever has ever watched a film before. Worse of all, it is so stereotypically marketed (even through its soundtrack) that all that was missing was Halle Berry snapping her fingers while saying to Sharon Stone ""huh huh! No you don't girlfriend!"". The performances of its cast is made of sheer non-commitment, an acute disaffection that is both understandable judging by the overall bêtise of the piece and insulting considering that people had to pay to see it. Last but certainly not least, the faux gloss of its CGI effects and the posturing of most of its camera works all conspire to hide the general lack of depth but actually manage to raise the bar of ugliness to brand new heights. So much so that it would be difficult to believe that it was all accidental.

It boggles the mind to think that Halle Berry could have ever thought ""Catwoman"" to be a good career move. Witnessing her, dressed for the oldest profession, struggling to act through this aimless debacle, the word ""trapped"" springs to mind. Was this some contractual obligations? What is certain here is that artistic integrity took a back seat after enough zeros were laid down on a cheque."
2174,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I can not believe how this move has got an 3.2 on the IMDb-scale. OK, its not a top notch movie. Not by far. But it IS a decent move, rather entertaining in fact. Of course, you have to get into the hole story.. it is a science-fiction story! By into the plot, and you will find this film rather entertaining. The people commenting on bad acting is way out of line, in my opinion. All of the leads deliver, and Halle Berry is brilliant as a shy, silent mouse.... And she is, at the age of 38, sexy as #""%& (like DAMN sexy)..... ;)

2175,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I admire the approach the filmmakers have taken towards ""Catwoman,"" for rather than setting their tale in the same dark, cavernous, largely computer-generated metropolis we are used to in most of these superhero movies, they have chosen to keep it rooted more in the real world. In a similar way, they manage to keep Catwoman herself believable, vulnerable and realistic, thanks in no small part to the beautiful and beguiling Halle Berry in the title role.

Berry plays Patience Phillips, a pretty, but less-than-glamorous advertising artist who works for a major cosmetics company, ruled over by a tyrannical CEO and his equally ruthless wife, the former spokes model for their products. When Patience mistakenly overhears the corporate bigwigs discussing the fact that one of their best-selling creams is causing women to become seriously ill, she is dutifully murdered by a couple of the boss' henchmen. However, all is not lost for Patience, for, unbeknownst to her, she has been chosen to receive the special gift of reincarnation in the form of a cat woman who will no longer be subject to the laws of either nature or society.

The best parts of ""Catwoman"" involve Patience's incrementally becoming more and more catlike in her attitude and demeanor, and her slowly dawning realization of what is happening to her. It takes awhile for her to accept this surprising turn of events, but, when she does, she becomes, quite literally, a new woman, bold, self-confident and willing to take on the oppressors and evildoers in our society. Patience is paired up with an attractive police officer (apparently the only one ever on duty in that city), who gradually comes to realize who and what she is as well. Berry and Benjamin Bratt make a very appealing romantic couple, and their scenes together are some of the best in the movie. Also impressive is Sharon Stone who deserves credit for allowing herself to appear in a role in which her ""fading"" beauty plays such a significant part (shades of Vivien Leigh playing Blanche DuBois in ""A Streetcar Named Desire""). Stone is the villainous wife of the company's CEO who is determined to make sure Catwoman doesn't spill the beans on their defective product.

The special effects are probably the least successful aspect of this film. Catwoman's jumping from rooftop to rooftop looks an awful lot like CGI effects to me. And the movie does occasionally go on auto pilot (especially towards the end), though, thankfully, not usually for very long. The literal cat fight between Berry and Stone at the finale is necessary, I guess, but really rather silly overall.

Still, considering the pounding this movie received from both critics and audiences when it was first released in the summer of 2004, I wound up being pleasantly surprised at just how enjoyable ""Catwoman"" turned out to be."
2176,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"What to say about this 'film'. I use the term lightly. Many have identified this movie as a hour and a half music video. I'm not sure which music videos they watch, the ones I see have better editing and actually some direction.

Most know the plot already, Patience Philips a shy person, blah blah blah, gets killed, blah blah blah, brought back to life from a cat, blah blah blah, seeks revenge, blah blah blah, dates cute cop, blah blah blah, fights Sharon Stone. The plot is not original, so one wouldn't go to see it for the plot. Not when they could just rent the Crow.

The editing and direction in the film is shaky. At times, the direction seems masterful, the opening credits were great. But after that the film fails. During a scene with just two people talking for about a minute or so, the camera switches angles about 6 or more times, and not even at logical places. The action sequences were horribly edited, to the point I nearly got motion sick.

The acting? I know Halle has an Oscar, but geeze... The woman is no Catwoman. When she's Patience Philips, well... Let's just say, I saw nothing unremarkable about her. She was hot and sweet. Had this been in real life she'd have men lined up at the door. At least Michelle's Catwoman at least looked like a geek. Sharon Stone is a very, very weak villain. Nothing threatening about her, she wasn't even a fun villain. And then, Benjamin Bratt who plays the cop that replaces the caper crusader? Well, let's just say, I think he was trying to suppress a snicker through the whole thing. He was eye candy for the ladies, although the character wasn't quite as stupid as some people make him out, he's still not the brightest crayon in the box. Sally, Patience's friend was the comedy relief. If you want cheap sex jokes you could get on cable, or even network TV, then she's right up your alley.

The effects were simply laughable. Really, they had a CGI of a cat (They could've used a real one in the scene easily.) they have a CGI of Catwoman walking and they always use CGI on the whip. And the way Catwoman moves... Its actually more like a spider then a cat. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised it they simply took Spiderman's scenes and changed him into Catwoman.

Lastly, was it entertaining? No. Not for me, I was counting the minutes for it to end. I could've been wowed, really, the opening credits were fabulous. But I'm guessing they knew that too since they used the same scene three times....

In the end, if I had to review it on the 4 star guideline, I'd give it zero, or perhaps 1/2 of a star. It really is that bad. When there's so many other good films out there, why waste money on this kitty?"
2177,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"For Summer films, I enjoyed Catwoman. I'll admit, I was hooked by Halle Berry portraying the character (sorry, I'm only a heterosexual male), and since I'm a big DC fan, I wanted to give the film a go. I enjoyed it, and thought that the film delivered. The story, action, and special effects were good to great. Catwoman, like Daredevil, relishes in the romanticism of the superhero archetype. Both motion pictures are stylish and sexy, and Catwoman did bring plenty to the screen that is admirable. The special effects were far from cheesy, and the acting was good. They managed to make a good superhero film and a ""Lifetime"" movie simultaneously. I understand that a lot of people don't like the Patience Philips character, since she is not the same Catwoman from the comics - but give it a rest!! This movie was in development for years, and they said as far back as 1999 that it wouldn't be about the usual Catwoman. If you enjoy movies for fun and the sake of it, check out Catwoman. It's nowhere near as terrible as people are saying. And trust me, the same people dissing the film now, will be the first ones in line to purchase the DVD when it's released."
2178,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Imagine a beautiful and talented actress like Halle Berry cast as the timid, frumpy graphic artist Patience Phillips, whose curiosity ultimately gets her murdered by her evil boss. Restore her back to life by way of a mystical cat until she morphs into this super human hunk of gorgeousness who can leap enormous heights in the blink of an eye and voila, you have Catwoman, the new super heroine.

The thrust of the clichéd plot is that her evil boss, the tyrannical George Hedare (Lambert Wilson) and his icy supermodel wife, Laurel (Sharon Stone), have created this fantastic anti-aging beauty cream, albeit actually disfigures the user after a period of time, which they plan to unleash upon the public. Patience discovers the plot and is killed by the wicked henchmen of Laurel. A mystical feline and her furry friends restore patience back to the living whereupon she realizes that she has these amazing powers and strength.

Unfortunately, while fighting crime in her skin-tight, leather, slinky, sado-masochistic cat outfit, the world mistakenly believes she is actually the criminal. Now where have I heard that one before? Anyway, she becomes enamored with the local police detective, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) while she secretly leaps from building to building--higher, faster and with more agility than the fabled Spiderman. The underworld and the police now have a new nemesis in the form of an extraordinarily seductive crimefighter with the agility and special senses of a cat.

Do not expect too much in the way of acting, plot, or direction and you will have a lot of fun while the adrenaline pumps chaotically through your veins.

Of course, there is also the visual feast of Ms Berry in leathers for the red-blooded American males in the audience and the women can fantasize and identify with her as a metaphor for freedom and release from the oppressiveness of a male-dominated society. Kids will delight with her romps amongst the skyscrapers of New York a la Spiderman and Superman. There is fun and excitement for everyone as long as you do not take the movie too seriously. For me Halle Berry is always worth the price of admission."

a comic book film,I'm a nerd yet I've never read a comic book in my life. but ever since i saw spider-man i have been hooked on their movie adaptations put those 2 together and you get the s**t filled litter-box: Catwoman(2004)

this is insulting, it's like they made one of those lame Katherine Hiegl style romantic comedies and just worked Catwoman in there somehow

Batman Begins came out a year later, and if i didn't know better this movie was made because the execs at Warner Bros feared that Batman Begins wouldn't make as much money since their last batman film was batman and robin. in order to make extra money they produced the worst idea for a comic book film and released it prior to Batman Begins to prove they could make a film worse than Batman and Robin.

there are people out there who are saying: ""dont be so critical, i enjoyed it, cant you just have fun"" how can i have fun with a movie that insults my favorite kind of movies by not even trying to be good

if IMDb had a 0 rating I'd give it: 0/10 I'd burn every copy if i had the power, i can say that with no fear Halle Berry accepted her Razzie award in person (it's on YouTube, i encourage you to check it out she was hilarious) in her own words said: ""First of all, I want to thank Warner Brothers. Thank you for putting me in a piece of s**t, god-awful movie... It was just what my career needed.""

a lot of people were personally hurt by transformers 2, for me yeah it had some lame moments but i didn't especially hate it. Catwoman is my transformers 2, this movie personally hurt me with how bad it was, i am a huge fan of comic book movie adaptations, and this was just frustrating"
2180,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"I'm loathe to listen to rumours and base my watching selection on reviews, but this was one time I wish I had. Catwoman was bad from the first meow. Berry wasn't even good at portraying a cat, she had none of the fluid feline moves, her hip popped out too much when she was trying to catwalk and her make-up looked like a MAC commercial. (For those who watched Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman in one of the Batman movies, you'll see the vast differences in the movements and even facial expressions of the two ladies).

Frankly this movie was a waste of time, money and film. If you don't believe me, go waste your time and money to find out for yourself.

Not only were the visual effect and CGI's poorly done, but there was no plot, storyline or even plausible dialogue. The producers and scriptwriters did not build a credible hypothesis to launch their logic for this story.

I'm sorry for all the comicbook catworman fans out there. They must have been pretty let down with this lame attempt. Sadly there isn't enough magic in the movies to make this film watchable."

2183,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"The reputation of Catwoman really goes before it. And unless you have been living in a cave, you will know that that reputation is not good. Halle Berry famously actually turned up to the Razzies to collect the worst actress award for this (hats off to her for that), although she then used it as a platform to blame her agent for getting her involved in the film – could she not have read the script herself? (Hats that were taken off for her are put back on again). Anyway, it almost doesn't need to be said that this is a pretty obviously clunky and shoddy film in many ways, with cheesy scenes around every corner. It has a bad script, poor direction and not very good acting. It's not helped much if you think back to earlier depictions of Catwoman from Lee Meriwether (Batman: The Movie (1966)) or Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns (1992)), both of whom were effortlessly cool, slinky and sexy, whereas Berry justisn't so much.

However, this is still a pretty watchable bit of nonsense. I have no idea how much it deviates from the actual comic-book character, as I know nothing about this. But it moves along at a good pace and we have a string of ridiculous scenes to appreciate as we go. It's not really helped by the fact that Catwoman really does not have a proper adversary to fight against but this is, like I say, down to poor writing. Berry is still decent fun to watch and the film is overall entertaining in a really daft way. It should really have been better though, given the potential."

I can assure you I am not one of those people, when I see a spade I call it a spade and to be honest I would rather be beaten with a spade than see this piece of c*** again!

I'm a self confessed comic book nerd and always have low expectations for movies of these but this really was a justifiable disappoint. I saw the trailers and thought wow Halle Berry + Catsuit = Can't go wrong. Well it did. The storyline had more holes than a colander. It was really boring despite being ""full of action"" and most the time made no sense. They also overused the CGI, nothing against CGI if it actually looks good. Don't get me started on the goofs, if I was planning on reviewing it fair enough I'll be scanning for any mistakes but this was something that I was casually watching on a Sunday afternoon.

If you want to see the film go for it. You may really love it but for me it was so bad and not even the ""so bad it was good/funny"".

I certainly never plan on watching this again."

When i go to see a Hollywood blockbuster i don't expect to see a movie that comes off as a poor clone of My big fat Greek wedding and Bridget Jones Diary and some CGI that looks like a afterthought. Also too much of the outside is obviously a studio set. When you think Judge Dredd and Supergirl got blasted by the critics and public, after seeing this Turkey.

So I took the plunge.

Everything you've heard is true.

I wasted 104 minutes of my life on a really lamentable production, and despite the lacklustre FX and neurotic editing, I lay the blame fair and square at the feet of French director Pitof. Trust me, I have high regard for French directors and French cinema, but this incompetent imbecile shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a director's chair again. Does this idiot have any concept of pacing, characterisation, drama, even within the fantasy realm? It's true I'm not an out and out comic book fan, but I did enjoy the Spiderman films and the first hour of the Hulk.

Alex Borstein was cool as Sally, and Benjamin Bratt was also good as the man trying to peel away the layers and find out who Catwoman was.

I mean what did you all expect? Yeah, they could've made it serious like the new Batman movies and it would've probably been even better that way, but they decided to make it more fun and cheesy like this and it worked out great in my opinion. Halle is one sexy cat, the other characters are likable, the story isn't anything out of it's world, but it certainly ain't boring, come on now... I really like the soundtrack, visuals (Remember that club with all the lights?) and the action scenes are pretty mighty. I would feel very cool if I could do those things, and isn't that the point of action movies? The special effects are veeery well done, they really surprise me to this day... I like the main character Patience a lot, she is a little like me, simple, shy and doesn't really express herself through clothing and a sexy style, but rather through her personality and talents. But her beauty still does shine through and the movie teaches us that we do have to let go sometimes and not be our usual selves to be even more attractive. We need to have some fun! No one is just one-sided! Even the movie itself has kind of earned that title, not very respected and loved in general, but there are people like me who find it to me damn good and that's all that matters!

2196,Catwoman (2004),3.4,Pitof,"Contrary to the movie's general horrible reputation, I actually enjoyed watching this movie. This film is probably ""Catwoman"" in name only, a departure from her true purpose as the sly, sometimes evil, cat burglar, as intended by DC Comics and creator Bob Kane. In this movie, we have Patience Phillips, played by Halle Berry, stumbling upon a plot to get people to buy this beauty cream; you keep on using it, your skin is smooth and strong like marble, and if you stop using it, your skin disintegrates. At the course of the events afterward (I do not want to provide any spoilers), Phillips becomes Catwoman.

Catwoman's mission to foil the villain's plot portrays her as an actual hero in the movie, rather than the crafty cat burglar she originally is in the comic book. This probably upset true comic book fans, for Catwoman was not given her true form in this film, contrary to what what Michelle Pfieffer did to the role in ""Batman Returns."" Pfeiffer delivered a solid performance as Catwoman and stayed true to form-portrayed as a burglar and a nemesis to Batman, but also has a love interest for the Cape Crusader and reluctant at times to commit crimes, making her more like an anti-hero rather than a villain. Berry portrayed the character more like a superhero, and bears almost no resemblance to the comic book character. In addition, probably the movie's sometimes cheesy dialog and campy special effects contributed to this film's poor reviews. Aside from that, I personally think the action is quite good, the movie is fast-paced, the plot is followed well, the subplot of how a woman can turn into a Catwoman is interesting and Sharon Stone gave a quite devious performance as the villain. The only problem I had was that her role was not emphasized enough; the producers should of depicted her actually showing her crafty self and committing evil deeds, like the villains did in the Batman movies.

In addition, a picture of Michelle Pfieffer in her Catwoman outfit was briefly seen in Orphelia Powers' house, which meant that Patience Phillips is merely ""another"" Catwoman.

Overall, a pretty exciting and action-packed movie. My favorite scene is when Berry storms into her neighbor's apartment, furious of his overbearing parties, silences everybody by squirting water in his loudspeakers and jumps on him.

So, with this movie, you may like it, you may detest it. I just treat this as a movie involving another Catwoman in the Batman/DC Ccmics universe.

2200,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"In what can only be described as the worst movie made in the past decade, Dungeons & Dragons will leave you begging for mercy.

Hands down, the biggest contributor to the demise of this movie was the script. It was litterally the most insulting, inane dialogue I have ever been treated to in a movie.

Props arrive next in an extremely close second. The 35 Million dollars used to make this film must have been used on late night taco runs, because the quality of the props is abyssmal. The ""prized artifact"" of the movie looks like it fell out of a box of cracker jack, while some of the armor and backgrounds are straight out of the Bargain Bin at your local toy store. Better attempts at fantasy film making have been shot on camcorders across the globe in people's back yards.

The acting was terrible all around. The few, and I mean FEW, attempts at serious dialogue were crushed by the worst script ever. The only remotely cool character in the entire proceeding was Demadar, who was still pretty goofy. I guess if I was 8 or so, I might have thought he was creepy. The notably great actors in this film should have balked the moment they saw the script/quality of filming, and their presence on the screen only adds to the insult.

Th producers of this movie should be ashamed of themselves. Hundreds of thousands of loyal D&D fans have been waiting for over 25 years for a great, inspiring movie from their hobby. D&D has a prodigious level of material written about it, and any one of it's 100+ books would have made a better movie if read aloud by Pee Wee Herman.

This horror show of a movie will no doubt ensure the demise of a great hobby in the public eye for at least the next 10 years. Any potential fan of the game will be unable to forget this awful movie experience. Consider yourself warned, and never, EVER see this movie."

Dialogues are painfully bad in this movie, as is the story itself.

The acting is also below any standard you would expect from such an expensive movie. Jeremy Irons was especially shocking, his performance was very pathetic and flat, as if this would be a bad movie for three year olds. That was not acting, that was a torment ! I cried every time he appeared on the screen.

Thora Birch was also far, far below her level in 'American Beauty', obviously unable to tell how one should put a little life into her bad dialogue and flat character, and somehow even thinking that that was her own fault.

If at all, the thief Snails (Marlon Wayans from Scary Movie) had quite some good moments in his slapstick scenes, the only good moments in the whole movie. Unfortunately they don't last long. Wayans seems to have a talent to shine even in the worst movies, however.

The performance of the main actor was also bad. His dull and cheap sunnyboy behavior really nerved me, and I saw absolutely no reason for his 'being special', but far more for 'being untalented'.

The effects where better than the story, but really not that exciting either.

Some people say fantasy is about stereotypes, but that doesnt mean you can forget all rules how to make up a good story ! This story was not worth getting on the screen. This story was also not worth getting such good actors and effects. This story was nothing but crap !

And I can't believe that Jeremy Irons and Thora Birch are such bad actors, they have proven they can do far, far better ! I can only guess it must have been the director who forced them to do such bad performances.

Definitely not recommended for anyone except maybe children below ten. Oh wait, they're not allowed ? No loss."
2203,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"If there hadn't been a ""Battlefield Earth"", this movie probably would have gotten my vote for worst movie of 2000. The only way it is (slightly) better than that movie is the (very) occasional good set or effect.

I could write for hours about what's wrong with this movie, but this is what comes to mind immediately

(1) The horrible acting. I honestly can't understand why someone so talented as Jeremy Irons would be going so over the top. It's clear, however, that he isn't enjoying himself in the movie, so maybe he's getting revenge against the movie by acting so terribly

The most annoying performance goes to Marlon Wayans. His shrieking, cowardly character uncomfortably brings up images of stereotypes from the 1930s. At least he doesn't say ""Feet, do your stuff!"" - though he sure comes close.

(2) The bright, glitterly look of every scene. When you think of sword and sorcery, I think we all think of things rough and with grit. Not here.

(3) The movie constantly rips off from other (better) movies, most notably from the four STAR WARS movies

(4) The characters. Why the hell were the dwarf and elf in this movie? They could easily have been written out without consequence. And the main thief hero is one of the blandest heroes I've ever seen in the movie.

(5) Virtually all the special effects, sets etc. are AWFUL. Sometimes they look even worse than those seen on the Xena and Hercules shows! (Though those two shows at least have the excuse of having lower budgets - and they make up for the cheap effects by having better scripts, characters, and acting!)

(6) And speaking of scripts...thos script is terrible! Mainly it's because the story itself hardly makes any sense!"

Now, don't get me wrong - I liked Army of Darkness, like the rest of you. If I expect to see a dumb, camp, action flick and I see a dumb, camp, action-fest, I'm happy. With the D&D movie, I expected a dumb, camp, action flick, and I received something that was so unexpectedly foul that it caused me to write the world about it. How did this movie even get made? Now, I play D&D ( admit it, y'all do too ) so don't fault me for 'not understanding the genre'. The movie had too many characters, some of which disappear inexplicably during the course of the movie. The plot made no sense; the twists at the end came from nowhere. And don't get me started on Marlon Wayans's character - you mean to tell me that in the fantasy world of D&D, a black man can't get a role other than the Black Buddy Cop stereotype?

Pure crap, plain and simple"
2205,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Ridley and Snails are thieves in the underclass of their world. Breaking into the magic school to steal they are captured by Marina but, when her master is killed, the thieves find themselves drawn into an attempt by the evil Profion to use the power of a lost sceptre to seize control from Empress Savina, who is trying to reform and make all men equal.

It is hard to really judge the plot of this film because I'm sure it could have been a rollicking, engaging ""swords & sorcery"" affair and it is only the delivery here that has turned it into a massive, insulting pile of rubbish. The way that the characters have to explain every single action in BIG LETTERS for the audience was something that grated on me and took me from thinking of it as lazy writing to finding it offensive that the writers thought I was too stupid to follow the story myself. Instead of being a strong narrative the film is just a basic adventure for kids, with effects and noise to keep them distracted. As such it is still only so-so because even children might struggle to care about the unimpressive CGI backgrounds and action set pieces. It'll please the very undemanding genre fan under 12 years old but unlikely many others.

The characters are another major failing  who thought that writing obnoxious, annoying or smug characters across the leads would cause an audience to be engaged by them? With this to work with, is it any wonder that the cast are roundly poor? Whalin must have thought his luck was in when he landed this role, but he messes it up with a performance that shows he is out of his depth and unsure of himself. McLellan is bland and quite irritating for the majority of the film but her faults pale in comparison to a trio of performances that stick in the mind as the worst of the film. Irons hams it up with all the carelessness of a pro who knows an easy payday when he sees it  he is hilariously terrible at times. Payne's blue lipstick seems to have affected his voice and every line is delivered as a sneer  it is never menacing and quickly becomes tiresome. However the worst performance is form, surprise surprise, Wayans who made me understand what Spike Lee's Bamboozled was getting at. He is a shrieking, mugging ethnic cliché  even worse than he usually does and even more annoying. The odd cameo from O'Brien or Baker do nothing to stop the rot and the cast add to the impression that this was cheaply made without much love.

Overall a poor film that will probably only appeal to kids. The plot is badly delivered and the effects are not as impressive as director Solomon was clearly banking on them being. The cast are lost in the middle of it all and not a single on of them gives a performance that you could call ""good"", all in all producing a pretty poor attempt at a blockbuster."

2207,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Is this a quality film? No, it is not. Is this a well made film? No it is not. But is it entertaining? Thats really a matter of opinion, and mine is yes, it is. One very important thing that should be remembered when watching any sci-fi or fantasy movie is that it probably doesn't have a good budget. Or casting, or effects or maybe anything good at all. You should go into these movies, and i do mean ANY sci-fi/fantasy, knowing full well that there is a very good chance it is lacking in production value.

With all that said and done, this movie was an awesome amount of fun to watch. As a regular dice roller, i found the plot to be consistent with an average game, or at least with enough of the games elements to do it justice. Yes, the acting could have been better. And the writing. But it was FUN. I had a fantastic time the entire time i was watching it. I laughed, i cried (not really) and i joked about it afterward.

My point is, this movie is bad for the sake of being bad. I highly recommend it for any one in need of a fun hour and a half. It's probably best watched with friends, for mst3k reasons. Just don't let any pretensions ruin a fine movie for you."
2208,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"I have just watched this film for the first time, & can confirm it is worse than what I had heard it was. Now as a rule I don't always take note of reviews of films, even if they are bad, as certain films can be bad & still quite enjoyable, even if the acting & plot are okay. Unfortunately, this is not only all the above, but also pretty tiresome & downright tedious as well.

The main unknown (to me anyway) leading threesome are all dreadful & from this showing awful actors as well. Justin Whalin is just laughable & one of the worst heroes in a long while. Probably since Val Kilmers appalling performance in The Saint. Zoe Mclellan is pretty enough (which probably explains away her deficiencies amongst other reviewers) but is still dreadful. The worse though is Marlon Wayons, whose performance is not only awful & completely unfunny, but also of a racist nature. The rest of the actors are also bad, but at least the likes of Jeremy Irons, Bruce Payne & Thora Birch, know they are only slumming it, & are at least decent actors if the material is there.

The plot is also weird & ridiculous, with no explanation of what is going on, & the upsetting thing was that the poor dragons couldn't have snacked on the lot of them, which would of at least made it a happy ending, for us & the dragons anyway. If you want to see a well acted & well made fantasy film watch Lord of the Rings instead."
2209,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"I couldn't agree more with what the majority of reviewers have to say about this film, it was the biggest pile of crap I've ever been cursed to see at the cinema. The acting was especially shocking and horrific, Jeremy Irons's acting was very bad, from this film alone you'd think he was an amateur and had never made a good film in his life but the truth is, aside of this farce he's a great actor, which is why it was really shocking to see him camp it up as the way over the top villain. Anyone who praises this rubbish as a good film needs their head examined, and I personally thought even the plethora of cgi effects were pretty lame! The amount of other fantasy films it rips off is incredible, but The Lord of the Rings and Stars Wars seem particularly prevalent for the movie to plunder it's ideas from, and the resulting effect is merely a travesty of those classic"
2210,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"As a D&D role player and obsessed fan I couldn't wait for this movie to come out. Expecting Lord of the Rings, I was hoping to find a fantasy prelude in D&D: the Movie. I had to see it twice, first time I couldn't believe how bad it was. I thought I had missed something but it turns out the makers of this movie missed a lot. They missed the D&D part, this movie only makes a mockery of the game and any plot imaginable. There is no acting, no plot. The very spirit of D&D is completely trashed. One of the worst parts is this Wayans guy who plays a Brooklyn rogue wannabe which is pointlessly killed in the middle of the movie. The characters are hardly believable (how stupid must the two rogues be) not to mention the entire action and party (""Only you were meant to pass""). A dwarf that barely has a role, a cute drow which also has no point in being there ... The movie barely adds up to 1 out of 10 and that's only because the dragon fight in the end is almost nice to watc"
2211,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Why can't I give this zero out of ten? I can honestly say that this is without a doubt one of the biggest pieces of crap I have ever watched in my entire life.

The cast for a start! I know...let's get Jimmy from the new adventures of superman to play a lead role! WRONG! Oh...you know who is really funny? Marlon Wayans! WRONG! I think the biggest injustice in the film is the ruining of Jeremy Irons career. I literal felt it being flushed down the toilet while I watched it. I tried to keep watching in all honesty, but I kept on vomiting blood from its sheer awfulness.

The dwarf keeps disappearing, the orcs don't attack anyone, there is a big slow guy walking around wearing blue lipstick, Richard O'Brian is forced into a camp off with said blue lipstick wearing man, it was far too long (by too long, I mean it exists in our time and space), in one scene Jeremy Irons looks as though he is mounting the guy with the blue lipstick...why oh why oh why does this film exist? For those of you who have seen this...I pity you. For those of you who haven't or have considered doing so, save yourself some time and just ingest bleach. It's equally as fun."
2212,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"There are many people out there who are completely and in my opinion ridiculously set in their views on movies. So when anything out of the ordinary comes along they dismiss it as bad or poorly made. When in reality it is a breath of fresh air in an ever stagnating Hollywood. It isn't often that something fresh comes along and while the story might not be the most original the style of this movie is. Some people say that the acting is terrible in this movie bu, I felt that it was very well done. For those of you who say it is corny and unrealistic I would love to introduce you to the real world. I an't count how many times I have seen people act exactly the way the characters/actors do in Dungeons and Dragons.

The plot in this movie was obviously streamline for time purposes but it doesn't suffer because of this. In fact it benefits greatly by keeping the action moving and the audience engaged. For once I actually felt the urgency of the task set before the heroes where as in other movies the horrible destruction of the world always seems to wait until the hero is done having sex with the girl and all the snappy jokes are delivered. If anything is unrealistic it is that type of story. Anyway I am rambling on so to finish up I love this movie and I feel that all those involved did a wonderfully spectacular job."
2213,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"I can only hope and pray that all the actors and actresses who appear in this film realise their mistake and get alternative means of income, they should be ashamed of the performances they put in. Marlon Wayans does an irritatingly poor and ill-advised Chris Rock impression all the way through the film that just makes you squirm and cringe. The other performances ranged from the badly cast, Thora Birch whose other work has been superb, as the princess to the ridiculous, represented by the performance of Justin Whalin. The total lack of any character development (which for me was needed as the characters are different from the cartoon I used to love) and the shallow acting all meant that I couldn't have cared less what happened to the characters, let alone cling on to the paper thin plot. With all this though, I sat through the entire movie,waiting for the end and feeling sure that Rocky and Bullwinkle Must be better than this pile of toss, and that dude, is saying a LOT."
2214,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"I've been playing or DMing (A)D&D for most of my 38 years. Even before I hit my teens I was writing better scripts for adventures then exist in this movie; there are so many plot holes the truck hasn't been built that's too big to drive through them, and despite having a cast of actors that aren't all that bad, the acting is in most cases similarly dreadful.

So, if you've ever played (A)D&D do yourself a favour and DON'T watch this movie, to avoid all the hair being ripped out of your skull whilst watching. If you've never played (A)D&D then STILL DON'T watch this movie - rent out Willow or Princess Bride or Ladyhawke or Lord of the Rings to get an idea about how good a campaign/adventure could be; watching this will just put you off ever playing the gam"

2217,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"""Dungeons & Dragons"" is so terrible, I can't help myself from laughing at people who say they liked this film.

This is one of the worst mistakes ever made in Hollywood. I had an inkling of what the end result of this film would be; however, I wanted to give it a chance.

The first problem is the lack of plot to accompany the numerous action sequences. It seems to me that the action was supposed to be the main draw. I can only assume the writer forgot that there are people who actually like to see a film with BOTH action and story when they see a film. In addition, the cause of fighting the villain is so stupid; who cares.

The second problem I see is casting. Combine an unestablished actor with little film experience and zero talent with a very talented veteran, Jeremy Irons and you have a disaster for a film called ""Dungeons & Dragons.""

""Dungeons & Dragons"" should have stayed locked in a dungeon in a far off place so nobody has to go the suffering I did when I saw this film. If you see this film, good luck."

2219,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"The actors ... falter. That's the only way I can explain it. In most of the scenes the acting is brilliant, but every so often we see a shot in which the acting is not up to par. Except for the actress who plays the Empress, who is consistently lousy.

And for some reason, there's one guy with blue lips. I don't know what that's about.

But beyond that, I can't think of anything wrong with the movie. The plot and the characters are engaging, the special effects are very realistic. If you know what to look for, you can tell that most of the shots of the town are 90 to 100% CG, but where the animation ends and real sets begin is less obvious.

2220,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"I love this movie. I really do. I saw it during its theatrical run and laughed so hard that I literally started crying at one point; so when it ended up on DVD, I had to own it. During the year-and-a-half that it has been in my DVD library, I've discovered an interesting fact: I...can't...stop...watching it.

Now, why do I enjoy this movie so much and publically p*** all over the far superior ""Star Wars"" prequels? Well, for one thing, I don't have any emotional stock in ""D&D."" It's a terrible movie with two-dimensional characters, bad writing, horrible direction, and so many cliches that if you tried making it into a drinking game you'd surely die of alcohol poisoning. It's never more than it appears to be: a potato chip movie. Sure, it'll rot the brain--but only if you take it seriously (which, I'm afraid, the creative forces behind it did, much to their undoing).

""Star Wars,"" however, DOES mean something to me...So when I see one of THOSE films and find it's riddled with two-dimensional characters, bad writing, horrible direction and a multitude of cliches, I have to wonder whether or not we even need ""Spaceballs"" anymore. Anyway, I expect more of Mr. Lucas...but NOT of Courtney Solomon.

Solomon and his screenwriters sought to create a trilogy here to cash in on the ""Star Wars"" phenomenon, and because the anticipation for the first installment of LOTR was growing, a fantasy setting seemed an obvious choice. However, the allusions to LOTR are slight (probably because it had yet to roll off the block); but it's a near-perfect copy of Episode I with a few OT moments thrown in. Obviously, after the success of ""Phantom Menace,"" it seemed an easy tomb to rob. The only thing that surprises me is how few critics (or fanboys) have mentioned it.

**************************************************

1)THE OPENING TEXT CRAWL

Anytime a fantasy/sci-fi movie opens with either a text or voice reading that ""sets the stage,"" we're reminded of ""Star Wars,"" which did it perfectly and without the pretentiousness that its imitators embraced. In ""D&D,"" Bruce Payne supplies the narrative. It's ""Star Wars"" in every way, right down to the way the last sentence trails off (""But the evil mage Profion has other plans....).

2)THE YOUNG QUEEN

Now, I don't understand why I was the only one with a problem with the concept of Queen Amidala. First of all, in a monarchy, you don't ELECT a queen; and secondly, if you do, you vote for the candidate who ISN""T thirteen years old. Seriously, how do you LOSE an election like that...?

""D&D"" aped this completely. She's young. She's idealistic. She's wooden. She wears god-awful dresses and gaudy head-pieces. Hell, if you want to get REALLY nit-picky about it, you could say that Solomon cast Thora Birch because of the strategically-placed moles on her face that suggest Amidala's ""red dot"" thing.

3)THE OLDER, TRUSTED ADVISOR WHO'S GONE BAD

Instead of Palpatine, we're treated to Profion, the worst role Jeremy Irons ever took (and his equally worst performance). Behind the scenes, Profion is plotting to overthrow the queen (referred to as ""the empress"" so as not to seem too blatant a rip-off), and is sowing seeds of discord within the council (senate) in order to overthrow her rule. His dirty work, however, is saved for his chief lieutenant...

4)THE DARK WARRIOR

Bruce Payne's character, Damodar, is equal parts Darth Vader and Darth Maul. He's a towering, sadistic, black-clad, slow-moving and unbelievably strong armour-clad warrior (Vader) who also happens to be bald-headed and painted with stupid-ass make-up (Maul, who didn't look stupid-ass at all). If this wasn't enough, listen for the thinly disguised echo of ""The Imperial March"" when he first appears at the magic school.

5)LUKE/HAN

In Ridley, we have a combination of the Luke and Han characters. He's a scoundrel who cares nothing for the ""greater good,"" but in the end, is willing to turn aside from his love of money (he rejects a pile of easily obtainable gold) in favour of saving the kingdom from the evil Profion. Also we learn that he has latent magical abilities, stemming from his father (this was to be expanded upon in the sequels, when Damodar tells Ridley, ""No--I am your father!"").

6)JAR-JAR REDUX

Marlon Wayans. Good God, could the allusion be any more transparent. Let's see: he's a tall, gangly African-American stereotype spouting catch-phrases, bungling his way in and out of trouble, and generally getting on our *beep* nerves with his not-so-fun humour. Hell, he even has a hat that resembles a pair of goofy, Gungan-like ears. The only satisfaction is that he dies painfully.

7)THE SCOUNDREL AND THE GOOD GIRL

Like Leia and Han before them, Ridley and Marina come from two different worlds: he's an opportunistic creep and she's a member of the aristocrisy. At first they bitch at each other to work out the sexual tension; but in the end, fall in love, much to our great surprise.

8)THE MIND RAPE

Remember when Vader interrogated Leia, using the mind probe to extract the necessary information? In this movie, he uses a pair of penises that live in his ears.

9)LET'S SAVE THE GIRL FROM THE IMPENETRABLE FORTRESS!

Hey--it's the only way to steal back the much-sought-after ""plans,"" right? And while we're there, let's have a main character die, allowing for our hero to scream ""NOOOOO!"" (while Milking A Giant Cow, no less).

10)CITIES IN TREES

At least the elf cities in LOTR looked elegant. The one here looks shockingly similar to the Ewok village.

11)THE SWORDFIGHT

When Ridley and Damodar have their duel, the clash of their blades creates a lightning effect, rendering the bad guy's sabre red and the good guy's sabre blue. Damodar is finally defeated after Ridley does a leap, sucker-slashes his foe in the midsection, who then falls over a steep drop. It all seemed vaguely familiar...

12)RESISTING THE DARK SIDE

Ridley is momentarily seduced by dark magic during the climax; but only by turning aside and embracing the light can he persevere. ""No! I won't become...YOU!""

13)BORING POLITICS AND BAD CGI.

Come on: you know it's true.

14)SPLIT-SECOND ESCAPE CHOICES

When reaching a dead-end while pursued by baddies, our heroes take the smelliest possible escape route: through the sewers. To reach this destination, they must dive head-first down a chute where they land in a pool of cr@p (not unlike the Death Star trash compactor, or all of ""Attack of the Clones"").

15)OTHER BLATANT RIP-OFFS

Need I mention how Ridley keeps grinning and saying, ""Trust me?"" Or how he goes through the Thieves' Maze, a series of ""riddles"" straight out of all three ""Indiana Jones"" movies? Or about the scene where Marina, belly-down on the floor, is grasping for the scroll, which during the fight, is getting kicked around like a certain diamond in ""The Temple of Doom?"" Or how Ridley is stabbed in the shoulder and can be healed only by the King of the Elves? Or that scene where.....

You get the point. Watch this movie. Watch it RIGHT NOW. It might be a hodgepodge of rehashed ideas, but it's ten times more entertaining than these new ""Star Wars"" movies.

By the way: a sequel has been officially greenlit."
2221,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"This pathetic abortion of a movie was just screaming for a cameo appearance by Joel and the bots. The special effects were weak, the plot was a laughable sequence of the worst cliches, the acting was simply awful, and I've seen better scripts written by 12 year olds.

Suffice it to say absolutely nothing interesting, unusual, or unpredictable happens during the entire movie. The best part of the movie is when you're standing outside the theater and decide not to see it at all.

Don't rent it either. Don't even watch it when USA starts showing it at 3 am because they couldn't sell the time slot. It's not even well done garb"
2222,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"It has caught the feeling of the roleplayinggame totally. People who don't like this movie can't ever have played the game in their youth. It's like actually watching an adventure played by thirteen-year-olds, and its wonderful.

I think people take this movie for something other than it was meant to. I think it was meant to be a fun role-playing-inspired film. Nothing less, nothing more.

I love the fact that everything that happens is classic and that every character is so un-original that it almost hurts.

Someone wrote in their comment something about that the elf and the dwarf had nothing to do in the movie, and they're WRONG! How could you ever try to gather a party to save the world without the dwarf and the elf, I just ask. Everyone knows that they MUST be in the group.

Another person wrote that he can't help but laugh at people who like this movie, and thats so darn sad. Do he laugh to hide his grief over the sad fact that he is so stuffed with criticism that he just can't relax and treat the movie as its meant: with a grain of salt and a big smile, cause hey - epical fantasy humor is FUN! If you don't like the movie, buy the game, roll a D20 and create something better with your friends instead of whining like a baby."
2223,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Some have said that those who played the game or enjoy genre fantasy films might find something to like in 'Dungeons & Dragons'. They couldn't be more wrong. This is a useless, clueless film from start to finish that has no idea of what it wants to be. It combines elements of a bad script, terrible acting, and average special effects to create a gloriously bad achievement. It's a would-be franchise that shot itself in the foot right out of the box. And if this is any indication of what future installments would have looked like, to that I say, ""Thank God.""

Jeremy Irons plays the evil wizard Profion straight out of Overacting 101 - he's all sneers and shouts and waving hands. His lackey Damodar (Bruce Payne) is blue-lipped and black-armored (therefore evil) and exudes all the menace of an overripe eggplant. Thora Birch - wonderful in 'American Beauty' - looks like she was blackmailed into this role, as she's completely catatonic throughout the film, giving her Empress Savina (the wholesome representation of all things Good) zero energy and appeal.

How about those heroes? Marlon Wayans (Snails, the thief) is completely annoying, offering nothing to the proceedings; Justin Whalin (Ridley, another thief) - the nominal hero - is a goofball who'd be outclassed by the cast of Baywatch; and Zoe McLellan (Marina, the mage) is the only one who seems to even try to keep to a thematic element of fantasy, though she's in way over her head.

'Dungeons & Dragons' is a complete mess and a complete waste of your time. If you want a fantasy film that draws upon the roleplaying game, try the one that D&D was based on in the first place: 'Lord of the Rings'. Keep this thing as far away from your television as possible."

This story is both interesting and compelling with several unexpected plot twists, and an unexpected ending.

2227,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Hard to say, was this movie aimed toward children? Anyway this is a rather disjointed and also disappointing adventure movie. The ""Dungeons & Dragons"" game serials showed some good potential for a full length movie but somehow they basically messed everything up.

It takes too long into the movie before it really starts to take pace and something really interesting occurs. On top of that the story feels messy. It introduces some plot lines in the beginning of the movie, that potentially seemed like good and interesting ones but then suddenly decided to abandon these plot lines for such a long time and starts to concentrate on the extremely formulaic and weak 'adventerous' story-line of the young and totally uninteresting characters. Only after more than halve way through the movie it decides to pick up the first introduced plot-line again, featuring the Thora Birch and Jeremy Irons character. It feels like two totally different and disconnected parts, so when the two of them start to mix it just doesn't work out.

The acting is just plain bad. You know, the sort of bad acting that becomes irritating after a while. This is especially the case with Zoe McLellan and Thora Birch. But of course also the weak and silly dialog doesn't help much. Perhaps it also has to do with the fact that director Courtney Solomon was still completely inexperienced at the time. And who's bright idea was it to cast Marlon Wayans? He feels totally out of place as the comical relief of the movie. And what a waste of the Jeremy Irons role. He perhaps has never played a more stereotypical generic evil movie villain but the movie he does it in is one of his worst. Bruce Payne also acts as if he thinks he is the new Darth Vader. Quite laughable.

Amazing and surprising to see how much this movie tried to be like the Star Wars movies. Many of the characters show similarities, story elements are the same, some sequences are directly copied and really the list goes on and on but these are the three most obvious elements. It's so obvious that it becomes distracting and makes the movie terribly unoriginal to watch. Why did they do this? Wasn't the concept of ""Dungeons & Dragons"" already original enough on its own? By the way, the Star Wars movies weren't the only movies this movie uses its 'inspiration' from.

The movie really isn't bad looking with its sets and such, though some of the costumes were quite silly looking. It obviously wasn't a cheap movie to make. The special effects are just reasonable for its time but unfortunately the movie relies too hard on it and overuses it in parts, of course mostly notable in the final battle.

The movie has some extremely bad and silly sound effects. I also really hated the music. It seemed to be alway present and I just wanted it to stop! It was the formulaic type of music you would expect from a genre movie like this, only composed by a composer who will obviously never make it big time.

You're better off not watching it.

2228,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"At the time when this movie was new, I was still a young child so I was not aware of the terrible acting or background scenery, and I didn't watch other science fiction shows like Star Trek so I had nothing to compare it to. As such, I enjoyed the movie, especially the gauntlet part, but thats mainly because I played Dungeons and Dragons with my friends, and the movie was a decent attempt to portray that, although I'd have to agree that two of the main characters were expendable. The worst attempt I've seen as a game crossover to a movie is Final Fantasy. Overall, I wouldn't highly recommend it to anyone.

My friend warned me but I insisted on wasting 20 minutes of my time the other night giving this movie a chance. Well my friend said I could keep it and use it for ""kindling"" in my new fireplace. He said he would have thrown it out but didnt think the movie was worth the effort in disposing of it in the trash... the movie would have been responsible in wasting yet another 15-20 seconds of his time.

I want to make sure this piece of %@&* is destroyed so I do not curse anyone else from stumbling across it. Hopefully it will not smoke too much as it burns. I would have been FURIOUS if I had paid $8.50 to see this at the movies. As a fan of the D&D franchise... I just have to reflect... what the *&%$ were the people at TSR/Wizards thinking?

The one thing that BAFFLES me even more is that there are rumours of a sequel ?!? I'm not sure if it's possible to make a movie worse than this one but give this director his honest chance in further destroying and ridiculing the D&D franchise."
2230,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Oh my. This movie was so phenomenally bad that I can't even think of an adjective negative enough to describe it. This is the kind of thing that ""straight to video"" couldn't have salvaged; that it actually had a theatrical release is staggering. I was expecting this ""film"" to be bad, but the true scope of its horribleness is beyond comprehension or anticipation. It is truly and magnificently wretched. Dungeons & Dragons makes _Conan the Destroyer_ seem like Hamlet in comparison.

The acting generally falls into two categories: mediocre actors who probably did the best they could with the material and normally good actors (Thora Birch, Jeremy Irons) who should be ashamed of themselves. Birch's dialogue is delivered woodenly as if she just wants the shoot to be over. As for Irons ((are those his real teeth?!? well, he is British)), his lines are spat out with such over-the-top absurdity it seemed he was exacting some sort of revenge on the producers. His snarling, rasping, phlegm-soaked performance left me thinking maybe he was blackmailed into doing this project. The only bright spots were the performance of Zoe McLellan as Marina and a very distinguished cameo by former Doctor Who maestro Tom Baker as Halvarth the Elf. Don't even get me started on the Marlon Wayans character -- I believe he single-handedly destroyed several generations' worth of progress defeating racial stereotyping in Hollywood. I hope he got a nasty letter from the NAACP.

Hammy dialogue atop a ridiculous storyline made for an unwatchable mess. The classic Dungeons & Dragons theme is the ""dungeon crawl"" hack-and-slay and a movie with this brand name to live up to should have capitalized on that. Instead we are treated to some convoluted plot about empresses and mage-councils and an oppressed population we never see.

Unlike some of the other reviewers here, I found the sets, props, costuming, and effects to be adequate for a B-movie, and even good at times considering this is really a C- or D-movie. All those thematic elements are lost behind the atrocious script and acting, however.

D'ya know how sometimes you want to experience something for yourself so you can decide on your own if it's as awful as people say? Don't do that with this movie. I promise that you'll spend the rest of your life trying to get those two hours back. It's not even worth downloading a pirated copy. If you must punish yourself somehow, try smashing your face into the wall a few times; ultimately that will be less painful."

2234,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"must be one of the worst movies ever.. the only good thing in it was the dwarf. my and my friends role play all the time, and were really excited about the movie. but going by what happens in d&d, the movie made no sense.

the main problem with it though, is that it wasn't made for people who play d&d. most (very, very, high majority) people who play d&d are in highschool, or not far off. the movie was made for 6 year olds. it was extremely childish, and utterly fake. magic in d&d doesn't work like it did in the film, wizards actually have to memorize spells to be able to cast them, or read a scroll. the way the characters interacted seemed to fake as well. the only character that can be considered well done would be the dwarf, because he actually acted like a dwarf. I rate it ."
2235,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"There's not much to be said about the plot of this movie, since there isn't one. Maybe it made sense to those who are familiar with the RPG, but to the uninitiated, it is never explained why any of the people do what they do. But on to the real horror.

It has been quite a while that I have been so severely shocked by acting this bad. It's not even an individual achievement, oh no, it is a collective effort of the entire cast (except the dragons, maybe). On the face of Thora Birch, whom I admire for her work in American Beauty, I registered a total of two different expressions throughout the film. Her impact was such that she might just as well not have been there.

Justin Whalin earned himself the number one position in my list of Worst Actors of All Times, beating even Chris O'Donnell to that position, and it should be said that this is the first time I ever saw him. Talk about a first impression. I cannot even put an adjective to his acting, as most of the time I found myself staring at the guy in shock. His presence must have rubbed off on Jeremy Irons, who really has no excuse for his participation in this disaster.

Was he trying to have his last name changed to ""Irony""? Unless he was being so ridiculously over the top on purpose, I cannot imagine what must have possessed him to act the way he did. Even the villains in the 60's Batman show were more subtle in their facial expression!

The film gets one point for its dragons, though. Nice fire-breathing, fine acting ability despite the horrible script (they really had no lines, did they), and charming demonstrations of athletic prowess.

By the way, if anyone would care to enlighten me as to what happened to the ""heroes"" in the graveyard in the end (things like this always end on graveyards), feel free. I really didn't get it. Which, of course, only deepens my resentment at having squandered two hours of my life on this abomination."

2237,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"I can only think of two times when I ever walked out on a movie because they were so bad: Hobgoblins (1987) and the sickening Dungeons & Dragons. I was horrified not only as an unfortunate viewer of this movie, but also as a seasoned gamer of Dungeons & Dragons myself.

The special effects were so blatantly fake it was sad. Some of the special effects looked like they were borrowed from a Playstation. I would have laughed had they not been so bad. Half of the beginning was needlessly panning around those sad excuses of computer animated buildings. Was there any apparent reason for that besides ""computer animation is nifty""?

The acting was terrible from all fronts. I was most disappointed with Jeremy Irons who has done much better in movies such as The Mission (1986). However, as Profion he seemed more like the Phantom of Krankor, the villain from Prince Of Space (1959). The only reason he came off as a bad guy was because he snarled and had shifty eyes. And why is it that neither of the two main villains can talk right? Profion speaks with that annoying lisp and shouts out every other word. That prevents any sort of coherence at all. Bruce Payne (as Profion's bald, lipstick-wearing, transexual sidekick Damodar) talks like a sad Shatner wannabe. He appears to be evil because he speaks haltingly throughout the movie. Let me also say that Justin Whalin (Ridley Freeborn) and Marlon Wayans (Snails) make the two worst heroes I have ever seen. You can tell Snails is a good guy because he acts like a naive, smiley ferret with a sugar high.

The writing was awful as well. The dialogue seemed so forced and unnatural. Especially the game-related humor, which was much too blatant. It seemed like the writers were thinking, ""Okay how can we put in as many cheesy, pointless jokes as possible?"" It seemed that their vision of the game-related humor was just to mention some of the terms. Here is an example of what they might consider funny dialogue: ""I'm going to cast HOLD PERSON on you!"" ""You can't cast HOLD PERSON on me! You're a mere LEVEL ONE mage!"" ""I'm casting HOLD PERSON now!"" casts the spell ""You cast HOLD PERSON! Oh no! Well at least you didn't cast MAGIC MISSILE!"" I'm not even gonna go into the over used amounts of exposition, the extreme number of unpronounceable fantasy names, and the repetitiveness of it all.

The saddest part was that it took ten years to make this movie. TEN YEARS and it ended up as this rotting pile of filth. You could get a higher quality story by taking a group of teenage Dungeons & Dragons nerds and watch them beat the snot out of goblins and ogres for 3 hours. In summary, this movie was amazingly disappointing. One out of ten because IMDB doesn't have any numbers between zero and one for voting."
2238,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Did you see the size of that Dwarf? This much anticipated movie of 2000, titled as the very popular role-playing game, should do much to further the question of ""What were they thinking?"" A great deal of the movie is spend in grandiose costume and CG sets with the actors, primarily one Jeremy Irons, as Profion an evil wizard, over acting in the most laughable manner. Which is odd because Jeremy Irons has never really done anything remotely laughable.

Irons had company in the theatre of the absurd acting style and that was with back up villain played by Bruce Payne as, Damodar in blue lipstick and shaved pate, delivering lines like a macho Tim-Frankenfurter-Curry.

And that is what is at odds with some of the primary components of this movie. I'm sure they did not want the villains to be completely laughable because they would have wanted them to generate enough fear or dread from the audience so they would be concerned for the welfare of the goods guys.

Then you have the good guys, Justin Whalin as Ridley and Marlon Wayans as Snails, who are suppose to have the kind of lighted hearted swashbuckling, devil-may-care, attitude which has been a foregone cliché' in the forms of Han Solo and Indiana Jones. However in D&D the lead character, Ridley, was more like a generic Starbuck from the TV series Battlestar Galactica. Marlon Wayans as the reluctant Snails had lines that were suppose to be comic relief but were flat and lackluster.

I do want to say that I am a huge fan of the Sword and Sorcery genre. I have read many of the great books from Robert Jordan, ""The Wheel of Time"" series, Terry Brooks the ""Shannara"" series, and as well as the first three Dragon Lance novels by Margaret Weiss and Tracy Hickman. I really enjoyed those books. So don't get me wrong I do love the genre and I know what it takes to make a good Sword and Sorcery story, yet I was expecting more out of this movie.

The character of the Empress Savina, played by Thora Birch was so visually reminiscent of Queen Amidala from the Phantom Menace that I could not help but be reminded of Amidala every time Birch was on the screen in those over the top costumes.

The story to D&D is real predictable. You know the standard, ""OH my God the Princess, Empress-whatever- is in trouble and the evil mean guy is going to ruin everything for her and that will be terrible because she is so nice and concerned about her people-and she's a hot looking unit to boot- so we have to get some reluctant swashbucklers to go through a whole bunch of cool exciting stuff and find a magical thing that will make everything better just in the nick of time before evil mean guy can make the Princess or I mean the Empress lose everything and cry her pretty Hollywood mascara saturated eyes out.

There is a scene in this movie where the character Ridley has to navigate a maze to obtain an important component in finding the magical ""thing"" to help the Princess err I mean the Empress. This was like a cross from ""Return of the Jedi"" and all The ""Indiana Jones"" flicks combined. I couldn't believe there wasn't one original pitfall in the whole thing.

You know I always thought Dragons were supposed to be formidable and intelligent. At least in all the books I read they were. Remember George Lucas's early eighties production of ""Dragon Slayer""? That dragon for its time was awesome and fearsome. The Dragons in this movie were so blatantly computer generated that there wasn't anything remotely sentient or frightening about them. I don't know if they want people to think that in the world of Dungeons and Dragons the Dragons look cool as unapologetically CG creations? The grand finale battle scenes were disturbing in that I kept thinking, ""What are those X-wing fighters flying around out there?"" You see there were so many dragons flying around and spraying fire out causing other dragons to go crashing to earth like jets or X-wing fighters in a dogfight. It was very distracting, as it had no look of realism. It just didn't feel like a movie that took place in the time of Dungeons and Dragons.

By the way did you see the size of that Dwarf?"

2246,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"I think many people go into this movie, expecting a AAA title epic, the likes of LOTR, or comes here after seeing the ""review"" (which is more a parody review, as all his shows) by Nostalgia Critic.

I saw it the first time when it came out in 2000, one year before LOTR set the scale for all fantasy films to come. At that time, this movie was a masterpiece, the likes of Willow and Wolfman... and with a similar budget to boot.

I found the movie to be a fair representation of the average Dungeons and Dragons adventure, and I have had a lot of those.

Although there were some things that I didn't agree with, I saw those for what they were, limitations of the technology of the time and of the budget. I knew going into it, that it would be a one-man production from a 19-year-old that had spent 10 years gathering the money for it. Considering the powerhouse names we see in the movie, the quality of the production and the stunning visuals, I think that was pretty well done.

This movie is skillfully made, has a solid plot worthy of the source material and the acting is on par with most AAA titles out there, despite this being a budget title and the debut of the writer/director."
2247,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"First: How is it possible that this has 3.6 stars on this site? If I could rate it zero stars...

Second: How could this film have been made? There is an automatic fanbase and hundreds of stories already written from which the ""writers"" might have drawn. I almost feel as if the producers/writers had no consideration for what is appealing about the role-playing game. As a person who played the game (if... 25 years ago), I have a good sense of why it was (and is) successful. None of this comes through in the movie. From the perspective of a player, I have to say that this is a slap in the face.

Third: I tried to imagine how a non-player might approach this movie. I even considered seeing it as a campy, B-movie sort of experience (and, mind you, I have a weird affection for decent B-movies). But there's something sickly and ill-informed about this production; all of the sets appear to have been constructed from styrofoam blocks, and the digital ""effects"" evaporate before you can touch them. At one point, it seems to want to be Queen's ""Flash Gordon"" but can't even pull this off. You can spot a moment when Jeremy Irons has given up, and tries to pretend that it's all a joke. Too late, buddy.

Fourth: Oh, don't let us even start to discuss the gender/racial stereotyping in this movie. It's another slap in the face of... all of us.

In summary: Listen, I'm a real fantasy/sci-fi nerd, okay? So I'm always looking for some good material, and when I heard about ""Legend of the Seeker"" coming to TV, I was SO, so excited. Alas, that show is all crap and makes me want to shed my nerdy credentials! That said, ""Dungeons and Dragons"" makes that show look like genius. Please don't see this picture.

If your a D&D fan then steer WELL clear of this movie as you will be shocked at how they can ruin the long running and much loved franchise in one fell swoop. The movie consists of bad acting, bad special effects and bad script (which comprises of mainly ripping off the phantom menace).

The main bad guy is established as being so by having blue lipstick on and talking in a slightly sinister voice, whereas the main good people consist of ""that guy from sliders"" and a comic relief element who only serves to be so annoying that you wish he would get eaten by a hydra or something.

There are no real D&D elements in this film, in fact better inter racial role play occurs in LOTR between Legolas and Gimli than in this sad excuse for a film.

I suppose next you're gonna tell me Thora Birch was that awful Empress, right? She was?!?! My God, how did they get those two fine actors to both be in this movie and act so badly in it?

2253,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Sorry guys, I really didn't like this movie. I do think not only is it the worst fantasy movie I have ever seen, honestly Legend and Princess Bride were much better, but one of the worst movies ever made.

The dialogue was inane and vomit inducing. In one part of the movie Snails says something along the lines of ""That is the riddlyiest thing I have ever heard"". Not only was that unfunny, but entirely out of place. The direction was off too, and the scenery was okay, but the camera-work was so flat and unfocused, it was barely a redeeming quality. And the plot was poor too, likewise with the special effects and you could drive a big tube train in some of the holes in the action.

And the acting was atrocious. Jeremy Irons is a great actor, participating in fantastic films like Lion King and Reversal of Fortune. But as the villain in possibly the worst performance of his career, not helped by the terrible dialogue he was given, he chews the scenery to pieces, honestly the dreadful overacting puts someone like Tim Curry to shame. Marlon Wayans was cringe worthy, his humour was lame and in some cases unnecessary, and Justin Whalin; bland beyond bland. Unbearably wooden at times, and as the hero? Tom Cruise did better in Legend and he was the main flaw of that movie. Just for the record, I do think Legend has its flaws, but it is gorgeous to look at, and Tim Curry's Darkness was phenomenal, and should've got an award. Thora Birch acquits herself better, but her dialogue was poor, and I was thinking, is she a little too young for the part?

Overall, terrible. You may like it, and I have no problem if you do, but as a die hard fantasy fan, I hated it. Watch Legend, Princess Bride or NeverEnding Story instead. 1/10 Bethany Cox"
2254,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"While not a masterpiece of any kind (the film barely exceeds mere competence) I didn't find D&D to be as bad as the negative reviews claimed. I put off watching it for so long for this reason, but it was enjoyable enough.

Comparisons to the LOTR trilogy are inevitable, so I'm not going to avoid it. I didn't really like the LOTR trilogy. It just seemed to be a bunch of movies that everyone was forced to like and if you didn't then there must be something wrong with you. Yes, they are much, much better made than the rather quaint D&D, but if you want a smaller, unassuming fantasy ride then don't completely rule this movie out.

The visual effects and production design of D&D are very similar to Paul Anderson's Mortal Kombat. Yes, it looks fake, but with just a little bit of suspension of disbelief you'll not even notice. I have a feeling that Courtney Solomon tried really hard to make it a good film but his talent doesn't extend as far as his enthusiasm.

In terms of character and story it is all pretty bland and generic. There's nothing in this movie that you haven't seen somewhere else. The actors do their best with the tepid dialogue and almost manage to not look embarrassed. The best thing about the film is it's surprisingly ferocious (maybe a bit too OTT) sound design. And the Dragon fight at the end was impressive for a medium budget film.

I was actually surprised to find Joel Silver's name on the closing credits. I will assume that without him the film would have been a REAL stinker. And what's with that ending?

2256,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"RELEASED IN 2000 and directed by Courtney Solomon, ""Dungeons & Dragons"" chronicles events in the kingdom of Izmer where the idealistic Empress (Thora Birch) advocates equality between the mages and commoners while the power-mad Profion (Jeremy Irons) plots to overthrow the Empress with the help of his formidable henchman Damodar (Bruce Payne). A ragtag team is assembled to save Izmer by apprehending the Eye of the Dragon: Two thieves (Justin Whalin and Marlon Wayans), a beautiful mage apprentice (Zoe McLellan), a dwarf (Lee Arenberg) and an elf girl (Kristen Wilson).

The first shot with Irons hamming it up as the diabolical Profion made me bust out laughing. In other words, the movie telegraphs from the get-go that it's not to be taken seriously. If you can roll with the campiness, this is an amusing throwaway fantasy flick. Imagine the gaudiness of ""Star Wars"" (1977) if the story were transplanted to a Medieval-like kingdom where dragons & magic are reality and you'd have a good idea of what ""Dungeons & Dragons"" has to offer.

This was a theatrical release that cost a whopping $45 million, but totally bombed at the box office. The 2005 sequel ""Wrath of the Dragon God"" (with only Bruce Payne returning as Damodar) cost just $15 million and is slightly better because the creators took the material seriously, but it's decidedly TV fantasy fare.

The film scores pretty well on the female front with the winsome McLellan and cutie Birch. Whalin and Wayans are entertaining as the two main protagonists, if you can get past their goofiness. People love to hate Snails (Wayans), but I found him to be a likable, amusing character.

Don't expect great acting, amazing battle scenes or a plot that follows smoothly 100% of the time, because let's face it, it's not that sort of film. But if you've got a free evening with nothing good on T.V. and you want something to watch that's light and great fun, I can recommend this f"
2269,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Hardly ever do i see a movie without a single redeeming feature. But this comes very very close. And the only two redeeming features here are not really good, rather just fun. At least Jeremy Irons and Bruce Payne know how to have a good time while the ship is sinking.

A young empress rules over a magic land. She looks for a wand that will help her rule the red dragons, this in turn would let her bring justice and equality to all lands. But an evil man is also looking for the scepter to use it to enforce his own tyrannical rule. Two thieves join forces with the empress and the hunt is on.

Well, the above summary was taken in part from a summary here on IMDb and on the back of the DVD jewel case. Why? Well because the movie makes no sense whatsoever, so had i to look what the movie was SUPPOSED to be about! This is a jumbled mess if ever i have seen one. Everything is just so unbelievably bad here. The acting is laughable (even the otherwise talented Thora Birch manages to take a plunge), the special effects are pathetic, the story is a mess, the directing is abominable... I stated above that there are only two redeeming features here. And they are Jeremy Irons and Bruce Payne. I like Jeremy Irons, at his best he is an excellent actor. And say what you will, but he always TRIES to lift even crap like this to decent levels. All his effort was for naught though, but still he tried and that is worth something. Bruce Payne on the other hand is his usual over-acting self, and offers the only laughs available.

This movie clocks in at 107 minutes, but it feels like five hours. This is a crap-marathon that offers virtually nothing in the way of entertainment. How this movie could be made is beyond me. And i actually remember some HYPE about it before it came out. If there is any justice in the world though, that hype went right down the drain along with the directors career. This is truly a 1/10."

I'd love to see a well made D&D film, with a good story line, good special effects, and proper casting. The wizard looks like he stepped out of a Brooks Brothers ad, a black woman playing an elf(no racist intent, but I wouldn't have Val Kilmer play Malcom X either)and a dwarf as large as the human characters, along with many other foul attempts of bringing the D&D world to life, just don't cut it.

I loved the movie, and the only condition to enjoy it is having played D&D and imaging you are watching and adventure you are playing with your friends. Some low level characters trying to defeat the impossible, with a terrible super high level bad guys.

Damodar? He is just talking like any DM!! Who hasn't heard that line he says "" Are you sure you want to do that?"" in a game? And there are many other examples. Everyone wearing heavy armors in a tavern... that only happens in the real ""D&D around a table"". So yes, watch it, but as you would watch your characters in an adventure.

Irons in particular appears to be acting as badly as possible, maybe so it's clear that he's not serious about this bowser, though Birch is awful too. The two leads are awful, especially the Wayans character, though the dwarf is a closer runner-up.

2273,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"""Dungeons & Dragons"" is so terrible, I can't help myself from laughing at people who say they liked this film.

This is one of the worst mistakes ever made in Hollywood. I had an inkling of what the end result of this film would be; however, I wanted to give it a chance.

The first problem is the lack of plot to accompany the numerous action sequences. It seems to me that the action was supposed to be the main draw. I can only assume the writer forgot that there are people who actually like to see a film with BOTH action and story when they see a film. In addition, the cause of fighting the villain is so stupid; who cares.

The second problem I see is casting. Combine an unestablished actor with little film experience and zero talent with a very talented veteran, Jeremy Irons and you have a disaster for a film called ""Dungeons & Dragons.""

""Dungeons & Dragons"" should have stayed locked in a dungeon in a far off place so nobody has to go the suffering I did when I saw this film. If you see this film, good luck."

2275,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"I don't know how to express how bad this movie was. I could swear and curse and it still wouldn't describe how bad it was. I'm pretty sure that the entire cast and crew have never touched the pen and paper game or ever picked up a video game version of D&D either.

Acting? Terrible. I can't believe that Wayans actually used ""urban"" slang for this part, it makes absolutely no sense. The world of D&D was not portrayed properly whatsoever. Even if the Dungeons & Dragons title was not used it would still be a bad fantasy movie. The dwarf was terribly stupid as well.

Bah, I could go on and on. If you're looking for mindless humor (if you even want to call it humor) with decent special effects then this is your movie. I personally couldn't even sit through the whole thing. Just to give you an idea of my opinions....I usually take movies at face value and there rarely is a movie that I don't enjoy. But this was BAAAAAAAAAAD.

2277,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Ugh. Just...ugh. I don't even know where to start.

If I was twelve years old, I might've enjoyed this movie. I might not have noticed the most infantile dialogue to profane the screen in years, the props and set design not worthy of a middle-school play, the ""follow-the-trail-of-cliches"" plot and simply atrocious acting. Most of the main heroes (although really, the audience should claim that title for surviving this piece of trash) are unknowns, and deservedly so. Wayans was irritating beyond all known human comprehension as a thief who, were he to exist in the real world, would stand less chance of stealing the proverbial candy from the baby than a leper with no hands or feet. And then there's poor Thora Birch in what looks to be a role ripped straight from Amidala in Phantom Menace (and written with even less charm, if that's possible), almost as thrilling to watch as petrifying wood, and Jeremy Irons, who skips chewing and goes right to inhaling great gobs of scenery.

Complete and utter garbage. What this says about Hollywood's impression of fantasy fans is thoroughly disheartening. Thank god Peter Jackson did a good job with LOTR, or otherwise this stinker would've put the genre on ice for at least a good ten years."
2278,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"I first saw ""Dungeons and Dragons"" in the summer or fall (don't remember which. It's been two years after all) of 2000. It was during the movie's opening week. I throughly enjoyed it. Sure, it could have used improvements, but how many movies can't?

The plot is that the evil mage Profion is a power-hungry would-be tyrant who wants to control the mage-dominated country of Istar. To do this, he needs either the royal scepter or Rod of Savrill. It has the ability to control dragons. Unfortunately for him, the empress of Istar holds the former. Therefore, he sends his chief warrior, Damodar, after the Rod of Savrill while lying to the Council of mages, of which he is a member, about how the teenage empress is too young, and therefore, too inexperienced to be empress. The empress is aware of this, and sends her best tracker, the elf Norda after the Rod. Meanwhile, the empress' status is in jeopardy due to the Council believing the lies of Profion. And on top of that, two thieves, Ridley and Snails, a young mage, Marina, and a dwarf fighter, Elwood, are unwittingly involved in this.

When you think about it, this storyline is actually pretty good. There's political intrigue to be found, something we don't see that often on the big screen. And although I didn't mention it earlier, we have a plot point that is the non-mages not getting many rights. This is definitely a better plot than I would've expected.

All is not well in the plot, however. Too much is clearly stolen from other movies. The ""Star Wars"" knock-offs are too numerous to mention. Also, the series of traps we see Ridley go through at one point clearly rip off the ""Indiana Jones"" series. I can live with this somewhat, but it does detract from the movie nonetheless.

The character development is fairly good. Ridley begins the movie as a typical thief. However, we later find that he has an apparently cynical past due to his hatred of the mages. Although he loses points due to how hard it is to not compare him to Luke Skywalker from ""Star Wars"" fame. Profion is pretty much how we would all expect an evil wizard to be. Hungry for power, hungry for land, hungry for slaves, and unwilling to stop at anything to get them. Most of the other characters don't get much room to breath, but when they do, we see a lot of personality from them. Except for Elwood. He doesn't get much to do. Although with the long cast, that's expected. We also see something of a psudo-romance between Snails and Norda. Snails is trying to put the moves on Norda. Whether she is returning or spitting on his advances is open to debate.

The One bad thing about the movie is that the last 20 or 30 minutes seem rushed. Ridley is transported to Profion's castle via a magic portal used by Damodar, gold dragons are suddenly attacking Profion, and Ridley's friends are joining the battle, even though we would have assumed they were a few states away 8 minutes ago. And after Profion is killed, we find that the empress has given mages and normals equal rights. Huh? That's the sign that they were running out of money/time to make the movie.

Despite this crippling flaw, ""Dungeons and Dragons"" is well worth watching. I know I enjoy it. Especially on my DVD copy. And for those of you who felt a need to give this movie a 1, let me present you with two fantasy movies: ""Conan the Barbarian"" and ""Hercules in New York."" If D&D is a 1, what the hell are those two stinkers?"

He did the best job in the movie. I also liked the troll guy. He was cool. The skeleton guy kind of creeped me out the first time I saw this, but after he was talking for a while, I got used to it. I am really used to it now. If you liked this film, I suggest you see Harry Potter and the Socerer's Stone and Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the R"
2281,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Ignore all the bad comments here ..... if you're a Fantasy fan. Now, I have never played Dungeons and Dragons, therefore I'm so lucky that I could enjoy watching this movie without having to compare it to the game.

I have been a fan of Lord of The Rings for many years. I have watched the LOTR movie six times at the cinema. I have read the LOTR books four times. I'm currently reading the Wheel of Time books by Robert Jordan. As you may understand, the Fantasy genre is somehow a part of my life.

This movie is funny, entertaining and it got a lot of nice locations. And it got my favorite creatures: Elves, Dwarfs and Dragons. And there's magic. Many ""cool"" spells and such. And elves that can heal people! The special effects were also very good, but don't expect the same effects you saw in LOTR (remember the huge budget that LOTR had).

Watch this movie if you want some eyecandy while you're waiting on Two Towers.

Enjoy!

If I should say something negative about this movie it is that it's a little bit too short.

I give this movie 8 out of 10."
2282,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Oh, Mystery Science Theater 3000, why did you have to leave us before this movie came out? When I first saw this, in the theater, I was somewhat impressed by the city sets and dragons. . .but, after seeing it on video, I saw the movie's many, many shortcomings. The plot is minimal, the dialogue is subsubpar, there's a *Wayans* brother,and there are so many Star Wars rip-offs it's not even funny. You've got Queen Amidala (the empress), Yoda (the elf king. . .replace ""magic"" with ""the force"" in his lines and you'll feel like you're on Dagobah) and the basic plot structure, as noted by other people. But still, I give this movie a 3, for 3 reasons: 1) Some of the sets and effects were passable, although the thief maze was an Indiana Jones rip-off 2) Zoe Mclellan is a pretty, decent actress who does an okay job 3) Even though MST:3K is gone, this movie lets you bring it back to life in your own home. My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed making fun of it; for instance, I found the line ""Not so talented, eh, Mr Ridley?"" to be absolutely hilarious because I had been making the same joke for half the mo"
2283,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"I am surprised this film has received so much negative comment here - it is clearly intended to be exactly the type of film it is, that is to say a film with strongly typecast characters, lots of effects, predictable plot (and plenty of plot-holes) ... and when viewed in that light it is a whole lot of fun.

My wife and I found it a highly entertaining Saturday night's viewing. I should add that before seeing this film she did not know what Dungeons & Dragons was, while I used to play it a fair bit (ahem) in my misspent adolescent years. The film managed the great feat of creating a world which was at the same time completely understandable to someone who was uninitiated and entirely familiar to someone acquainted with the principles of the game.

I cannot understand the zero ratings this film has received from some reviewers. I have fairly mainstream tastes, and in terms of plot, dialogue, lack of characterisation and so on, it is certainly no worse a film than Star Wars The Phantom Menace or one of the Die Hard films - again, not exactly high-brow films but thoroughly enjoyable nevertheless, and certainly the kind of film I like to watch to relax.

Indeed, some elements in this film are outstanding: the costumes, the gothic imagery, the real-life locations in Prague (dig that library!).

Among the actors, we were particularly impressed by Justin Whalin, who made a fine and believable young hero, without any of the brattish qualities that a lot of actors in similar roles have had (think Mark Hamill), also by Kristen Wilson who is simply a delight for the eyes. We had not heard of her before, (we have not seen Dr Doolittle) ... but it seemed to us absolutely right to cast a lithe and graceful former ballerina in the role of an elf. Or should that be a half-elf, perhaps? It was not clear why Norda and Halvath looked significantly different from the other elves unless they were half-elves.

In terms of accurate portrayal of D&D the game, I very much liked: the fact that all the characters had a clearly defined class; the rivalry between different character classes; the clear alignment of characters (chaotic good, lawful evil etc); the fact that magic users needed ingredients (e.g. magic dust used by Marina Pretensa) for their spells; all the traps; the 'game balance' that is to say that there were few monsters and that most 'opponents' were humans/humanoids; the fact that Profion had a familiar. I did not think it was accurate that a thief (Snails) should be clumsy, nor that characters who were supposed to be of low levels of experience (Pretensa, Snails and Ridley) had so many high level abilities - Ridley's excellent fighting skills, Pretensa's powerful spells. Also I found the presence of what were apparently orcs in the tavern to be a trifle bizarre.

Having watched this on DVD, one thing stands out, though, and that is that some inexplicable and, can I say, inept cuts were made in producing the final print. Several key scenes which are absolutely necessary to understand the plot have been cut - one where Elwood Gutworthy (the dwarf) introduces himself to the rest of the party, one where Ridley and Pretensa are actually inside the scroll and given a map of how to find the Rod, one where the romantic interest between Norda and Snails is developed. There is no apparent reason for these cuts - certainly the quality of the deleted scenes on the DVD is just as good as the rest (although of course they have not received post-production processes - you can actually see the sudden transition from polished to less-polished in the Norda/Snails scene). If other reviewers have given the film low ratings because of these cuts, I can perhaps understand it ...

And to any director/editor/studio thinking of cutting scenes as a result of test audience feedback, I have a piece of advice for you: Don't. (For a good example of why this is not a good idea, see the 'Making of' feature on Twelve Monkeys.)"

2285,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Interesting attempt to bring the popular role-playing game to the big screen. This film will certainly appeal to hardened AD&D gamers and to fans of fantasy. To others, it may seem like a poorly-acted romp through silliness, plagiarising the Phantom Menace and with an over-long dragon scene at the end.

However, viewers prepared to watch with tongue firmly in cheek will find this an enjoyable experience, with likeable characters (particularly Richard O'Brien's thief king Xilus resurrecting his role as referee of the Crystal Maze) and a hammishly played villain complete with English accent.

Definitely not to be taken seriously but worth watch"
2286,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Okay, fantasy has never done well in cinema for some reason, probably because it's always done tongue-in-cheek. That will undoubtably change with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but for now, let us focus on Dungeons & Dragons.

As a lifelong fan of the game, I had long known a movie was in the works, but even five years ago when I read the plot outline (the script was being worked on for ten years), I was disappointed. Main heroes--thieves? Politics? More and more it sounded like the less-than-imaginative, coorporate mentality of D&D in the 90s rather than the classic mythos of the 70s and 80s that made it great (al la, when Gygax was still with TSR).

Well, I would give the movie the benefit of the doubt, and we geeks and lunatics went on opening night in full costume to mark this long awaited event. Credit where it's due, the movie's relatively small ($33 million) budget did turn out good production values, including a wide variety of beautiful, very D&D-like sets, costumes, and special effects. However, the movie was crippled beyond hope by the script and acting. Yes, the plot was imaginative, but you think with TEN YEARS of development one would have realized and fixed all the plot holes, the biggest of which was the fact that, in the end, the ""heroes"" accomplished absolutely nothing! All they did was spend the entire movie tracking down a rod that controls dragons, only to end up giving it to the villain, making him stronger than ever, and then the princess he oh-so feared whips him anyway, probably (and off camera of course) to Thorna BITCH at the ""heroes"" afterwards--""Thanks for making my job tougher, guys!""

The acting was atrocious. I know this game was targeted at teens who play the game, but it felt TOO MUCH like a game. You would think that moviemakers would have learned from such fiascos as Super Mario Bros and Double Dragon that, in order to turn a game into a film, it needs to take itself seriously. Jay Jar Wayans could have been left out, the Princess (Thorna Birch) could have tried to be something other than a piece of cardboard, and the other characters could have actually been there to do something. Back to the fault in the script, isn't the main concept of D&D an adventure PARTY? But in this movie, it's always a lone hero going forward while the rest of the party hangs in the back. Well, that along with the empty ending, I guess, accidentily, they DID make a movie that plays like a D&D game of today. Hmmmm...

If you approach this movie as a campy, ""popcorn"" movie, then it's a surprisingly good treat, eye-candy mostly. However, if you have any love or passion for D&D, any desire to be thrust into a fantasy world, or any hope of a gripping adventure, then try to avoid this movie as much as a modern D&D adventurer avoids danger.

Given the rich mythology of D&D developed over the last twenty five years, the countless worlds and countless possibilities for storylines, it seems that a script ten years in the making ended up with the most politically correct (gahhhh), Star Wars-like, cheesy, save-the-world scenario possible, which, of course, is totally against the spirit of the D&D game. Now, for a few nit-pickin's:

1) No fighter. Given D&D's ""Conan"" roots, you'd think there would be at least one fighter in the party, but there wasn't.

2) The dwarf. He was almost as tall as everybody else. Although he played a dwarf rather well (given the stereotypes), he just wasn't ""dwarven"".

3) Stolen scenes. Mostly from Star Wars.

Oh well. Actually, an official D&D movie was never a good idea, because the whole of D&D mythology could not be compressed into one movie, or even an entire series of movies. We're better off enjoying cinematic treats like Conan, Willow, and Lord of the Rings, and re-living their mythologies in the D&D world. That said, look for the Lord of the Rings to completely change moviegoer's views on fantasy, and finally establish the genre. Forget George and Jar Jar--LOTR is the Trilogy worth waiting for!

I'm still a fan of D&D, even if they've totally lost their way."

Imagine my surprise then, when I found about a hundred other things to love about the film! Justin Whalin was a revelation, displaying some leading man qualities found in Mad Max (Mel Gibson), Conan the Barbarian (Arnie), even The Mummy (Brendan Fraser). He has still a way to go before hitting the same big time as the above have, but it's a great start! Zoe McLellan has now become one of my favourite actresses. (She was great in the Star Trek Voyager and Sliders episodes I remember spotting her in) And she's gorgeous, to boot! Richard O'Brian was as weasly and grimy as he always seems to be. (Keep it up!) Alright, so Bruce Payne and Jeremy Irons were...to be frank, terrible, but to be honest, the film didn't need good acting to be good.

I told him about the critics but he still said he enjoyed it. That was it, damn the critics, I have to see this movie.

I loved it. I nearly missed it. Did Profion over act? No, he played the part of an insane mage wonderfully. Did Empress Savina appear shaky? Yes, wouldn't you if you were young and trying to change things while nearly every mage around you opposed you. She played the part well. Did Snails scream too much? No he screamed just enough. Were the locations and special effects good? Yes, they were awesome. Was it realistic? No, it's a fantasy movie after all and it's all about imagination.

Yes, I really did enjoy this movie. It's the best fantasy movie ever made and it rates as one of my all time favorites. I recommend it to everyone, but remember, sit down, forget about reality, and imagine away.

This was directed largely at a teenaged audience while those who remember D&D would be much older. Some of the political ""for the people"" plot seemed a bit trite, but really no more than SW Episode I. Otherwise, good film. I don't understand why it got such bad reviews. The plot was believable, the characters were likeable. There was even great depth of character, an element missing in many action films. I thought there was too much emphasis on the main characters and too little on the interesting supporting characters. I wouldn't call it a classic tale of good verses evil but it had a good plot and interesting characters with good interaction between them. I'm giving it a 9 out of 10 just because every one else gave it such a low rating. It would otherwise have been an 8. It wasn't perfect but it was a pleasing film (and I'm hard to please). For my fellow ex-pats looking for a VCD, the one I bought was in the jewel box inside the cardboard box claiming to be a DVD rip.

2292,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"You can only truly appreciate this movie if you walk into the theater with low expectations, a mild buzz going, and a group of wise-acre friends to heckle the movie screen with.

Jeremy Irons chews the scenery so much, it sounds like he's regurgitating all his lines. His henchman, Bruce Payne (who looks as if he's just swallowed a smurf)delivers...his...lines as slowly....and as quietly...as...possible.

It's also easy to spot the none too subtle movie rip-offs, from the ear parasite of ""Wrath of Khan"" to elements from all three Indiana Jones movies being used in the Thieve's Maze sequence. (The maze itself is three whole rooms...)

The CGI dragon battle at the end is kinda cool, and Tom Baker is in it. Even if I weren't such a dyed-in-the-wool Doctor Who fan, I'd still say he was the best thing about the movie. And he's only in it for two minutes.

2295,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"This movie isn't as terrible as some would have you believe. I originally thought this would be an abysmal, boring movie, but after seeing it tonight, realized as a D&D fan since second edition, that it was trying to be a fun movie. Don't take it seriously. This isn't Lord of the Rings nor some other high profile fantasy film nor series. Instead, it feels like it tries to capture the feeling of playing D&D by presenting the main characters with a variety of challenges - social, stealth, combat, and puzzle. It doesn't try to care about the characters' stories that much, just like players normally don't care that much about their characters' stories: They just want action.

Bruce Payne and Jeremy Irons made the film more enjoyable by being cartoonish villains.

2300,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Though not a good movie as the acting is hammy, the characters somewhat stereotyped or annoying but I find this movie is a perfect example of an actual game of D&D where people are role playing, yes the script is terrible but so are most attempts at conversation between PC's and NPC's in a D&D game, yes some jokes don't work or are obvious what's going to happen, but that happens around the table, yes it blatantly rips some scenes from other movies, yet again speaking as both a game master and a player that happens all the time in D&D games and yes, the villains are ridiculous and immensely incompetent but again that happens all the time in actual D&D games. I choose to view the movie in one of two ways, either as a cheesy movie to laugh at with friends, or to view it as the minds eye of a bunch of people around a table playing dungeons and dragons.

2304,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Lets face it: most people doing movies, especially fantasy movies are morons. Conan The Barbarian is one of the few good pre 'Lord Of The Rings' fantasy films, yet most pre-LOTR fantasy films tried to ape up CtB inferior sequel 'Conan The Destroyer' and 'Red Sonja'. This is also the case with 'Dungeons And Dragons', a movie based on the famous RPG.

A couple of months ago I might have gone as far as claimed, that DnD was the worst movie I've ever had pleasure to witness, but that was before I had introduced myself to the ""movies"" made by Dr. Boll. That is the level DnD manages to stay out of, yet I am not claiming this to be a good movie, quite the opposite really. It just is as bad, that it is actually quite hilarious. In every aspect, expect when it tries to be funny.

The badness of the film ranges from the notable actors to the feeble script. Jeremy Irons, one of the greatest actors of our time, is hamming up the role of eeevil mage Profion just from the heck of it. His overacting is so dramatic that it is drop dead funny. Funniest character of the film is Mr. Blue Lips (Bruce Payne ), vastly overacting henchman of Profit, er, Profion.

The plot is quite simple: the empress Savina (Thora Birch) is like the guide book to American Democracy, trying to give equal right to commoners and mages. Profion is of course the baddie, who wants the power. So Jimmy Olsen, sorry, Ridley (Justin Whalin, who hasn't changed since 'Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman') and totally unfunny lines throwing Snails (Marlon Wayans), who is just a bit above Jar Jar Binks, need to get Eye of The Dragon in order to get Staff Of The Dragon, that can control dragons. Oh and they have this dwarf sidekick, who has the most laughable false beard of the movie history.

The writing is simply put amateurish from the pro democracy speeches of the empress (isn't that a bit of an oxymoron really), to the badly done death scenes and hilariously bad lines thrown by Irons.

CGI effect scenes would be good, if they would be sticked on a computer game, though lately more than few games have shown better graphics than DnD does.

To put this all in perspective, DnD is not the worst film I've seen, it's just a bad movie. It's bad in a way it is hilarious.

Real movie score: 2 out of 10. I kind of liked a couple of scenes in the film.

Camp movie score: 8 out of 10. If this isn't a future camp classic I don't know what is. Mr. Blue lips alone is enough to rise this movie in the same league with Ed Wood's 'Plan Nine from Outer Space'."
2305,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"This movie is mediocre, at best, but there are some surprising elements that save it from being a total waste, chiefly the score. An ""apprentice"" of Hans Zimmer (Hollywood seems to be littered with them lately), Justin Caine Burnett does a remarkable job with the music in this movie, capturing the spirit of adventure and still remaining fresh (compared to Zimmer's more stale scores of late, I'd say Burnett took all the good elements of Zimmer's style, and replaced all the overdone and trite composing Zimmer has done lately with some true originality). In short, the music saves this movie.

The acting was terrible, the dialog stilted and artificial. Marlon Wayans so annoying, and the character he played was demeaning. Snails was a character who deserved to die. Jeremy Irons was obviously slumming; in interviews he openly said that he did this film for the money. His performance was over-the-top ham at its worst.

When I saw it in the theaters, people were either walking out or laughing when the movie was trying to be serious and dramatic, or staying stone quiet when it was trying to be funny.

2311,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Seeing a film in the theater on Christmas Eve has been a tradition of mine since I was a kid. On Xmas Eve 2000, my theater hadn't yet gotten Cast Away or Crouching Tiger, but it did have my third choice, D&D. Well, I've never been so intricately close to D&D that I would have been labeled a sinner in the 80s, but I have ALWAYS loved medieval fantasy, and many of the D&D stories and characters. So, I had the feeling going to the film that I would have a good old popcorn munching time with one of my favorite genres. No decent movies about medieval times had come out in a while, so what better than D&D to end the drought?

Well, I left the theater laughing. Not at the movie, but at myself for having such high hopes. It had potential, I'll say that. I chuckled at a joke or two, I liked some of feel, like magicians and thieves and whatnot. But in the end, it felt like a washed out, Lord of the Rings lite. And who would have known that LOTR would indeed come out a year later and absolutely blow everyone's socks off?

The main problem with D&D is its basic plot. Several characters band together to retrieve a magical item and defeat the wizard. Ok, sounds fair. But the characters are so wooden and stereotypical, I just didn't care. The thieves are rebels who believe in justice and equality. The wizards are old and power hungry. The dwarf likes beer and fights. The elves are delicate and mysterious. And that's about the most we get to know anybody, although the main two characters (thieves) get more screen time and somewhat anachronistic dialogue. I admit I was surprised by a death halfway through, and surprised again at what happened / didn't happen with the dead at the end of the film. But outside of that, it's pretty stock stuff. And don't look for Jeremy Irons to save the film, he overacts here with the best of them. Although I did enjoy his last scene or two involving his magic and the dragon battle.

I guess bottom line is that it's worth a see if you're a real D&D or fantasy fan, but other than that, it's not that great, and if you've seen Lord of the Rings by then you've already seen better. Just too bland."
2312,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"You can tell ""Dungeons and Dragons"" is based on a game. You have your bad guys, and you have the heros who have to defeat them. The heros' quest is helpfully broken up into smaller tasks, introduced with lines like ""In order to find the magic rod, we must first get the Eye of the Dragon from the head of the Thieves' Guild."" Even the settings look like something you'd find in a standard RPG video game.

The problem, of course, is that this isn't a game, it's a movie. In a video game, you have some hand in the fate of the characters, and you can spend time figuring out just how to get past that one level. With ""Dungeons and Dragons,"" all we can do is watch, and think about how incredibly dumb it is.

Welcome to Izmier, ruled over by one of those teenage monarchs who can manage an entire kingdom at an age when most of us were having a hard enough time managing our hormones. Empress Savina (Thora Birch, in what looks like Natalie Portman's ""Star Wars"" castoffs) wants to declare equality among her people. That she apparently has both the authority to declare this and the power to enforce it is, of course, a sign of totaltarianism, but never mind. It's just an excuse for the evil mage Profion (Jeremey Irons) to attempt a rebellion, for which he needs a MacGuffin of a magic rod which will enable him to control red dragons.

By circumstance, the map needed to find this rod is in the hands of who I fear are our heros: semi-compitent thieves Ridley (Justin Whalin) and Snails (Marlon Wayans), a novice lady mage, an elf, and a dwarf. Ridley and the mage take an instant dislike to each other, so we know they're destined to be together. Snails provides what would be comic relief, except it gets old quickly. By ""quickly,"" I mean ""right away."" The elf exists primarily to wear one of those steel push-up breastplates all female warriors wear in movies like this. The dwarf does standard dwarf schtick--axe-swinging, alcohol-swilling, and general grumpiness.

That's the plot, which mainly exists to give the characters an excuse to go through all the standard sci-fi/fantasy/adventure sequences. Among the scenarios dutifully checked off: a tavern filled with a colorful, multi-species clientele, a booby-trapped maze, the capture and rescue of the principal female character, dire warnings that the thing which everyone's looking for would best remain undiscovered, and hints that Ridley has some great destiny. And the final battle sequence, fought by huge computer-generated dragons who breathe fire and crash into the scenery (hope Savina has a good urban renewal budget). All of these sequences have been lifted wholesale from other sources, most notably the ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones"" movies. And it's not just the plot that's been ripped off: one of the musical motifs sounds as much like the ""Imperial March"" as possible without paying John Williams royalties.

Hey, I've got nothing against ideas that have been done before--heck, this stuff wasn't exactly original when Lucas and Spielberg appropriated it. But ""Indiana Jones"" and the first ""Star Wars"" movies were done with energy and style, a sense of conviction and fun that made the material work. ""Dungeons and Dragons"" slogs from one scene to the next, often without any sense of connection between them, making it feel more like an obligation than anything interesting. The cast is either lifeless (Whalin and Birch) or ridiculously over-the-top (Waylans and especially Irons, who snarls and bares his teeth more than his ""Lion King"" character). There are a couple cameos designed to provide chuckles for the geeks of the audience, but they're mild thrills in a movie that has no major ones."

Poor plot, special effects of Playstation-quality and waste of talent for Jeremy Irons and Thora Birch. Tho I agree with the most of this I must say I enjoyed most of the movie. It's just not to be taken seriously, which is obvious when you watch Jeremy Irons and Marlon Wayans. And it's not an Oscar-contender either when you watch that female wizard (she's really cute tho!).

Buildings are like those on the game boxes from afar but seem to be condemned warehouses close up. Sound bad? I haven't even begun to comment on the story. Why? It's simply not there. In the heydays of RPG the story was less important when good gameplay could make up for it.

It's definitely not a good Dungeons and Dragons movie. (Here's a tip for the Hollywood: Get Bioware for consultation - they already make D&D computer games the way they should be done.)

2319,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"I have to agree with ericmuss of Cleveland that hardcore D&Ders will likely as not dislike this film. Myself, having played most systems out there, saw all of the potential. This movie was EXACTLY LIKE a real game. The characters didn't always get along. The powers didn't obey exactly what the books said.

But best of all was the special effects. They weren't so spectacular that they directed the course of the movie; they did, however, leave something to the imagination, and encouraged the suspension of disbelief (which I personally think is a quality lacking in cinema these days). The cameo appearances were fantastic; Richard O'Brien was spectacular as Xilas, Guildmaster of Thieves. This role had some similarity to his part as Cosmo Nation in the film ""Shock Treatment,"" with the maze, and... well, I won't spoil it. Tom Baker played the King of the Elves, and delivered a brief role which harkened MY mind back to his days as the good Doctor.

2321,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"When I saw that a Dungeons and Dragons movie was coming out I admit I got excited. I grew up playing D&D afterall. But this movie not only let me down on the D&D aspect (there was a superficial resemblance, but please, a thief taking out a high-level fighter in plate?), but was also very bad as a movie.

The worst actor in the whole movie (Whalin) got the most screen time. Actually they were all pretty bad actors. Well the bad guys did a decent job with the slop they were given for lines and characters. Oh and Thora Birch's empress is basically exactly the same as the empress in Star Wars:Phantom Menace. Except she doesn't have an alter ego that allows her to move her face when she acts.

Also why does the movie have to get all preachy? The dragons are the source of magic. Killing the dragons will cause the death of the world. The elves don't manipulate magic, they are magic. Blah blah blah. Next time let greenpeace write the stupid script.

Basically the story is that two common thieves decide to break into the Mage's tower to grab some cool stuff only to stumble upon a plot to over throw the empress. So they run away with the map and the girl, oh and a dwarf starts following them around for comic relief. Although he isn't that funny, and neither is Marlon Wayans (also comic relief) although he approaches funny at times.

Oh did I mention the nifty computer dragons? They were pretty good. And they had some other computer generated baddies from the game. So I would suggest they make a short of this. Take out all the parts where someone tries to act, except when Jeremy Irons is doing the crazy mage thing (because crazy mages are cool) and save only the scenes where there is cool CGI stuff.

2/10, one point for Jeremy Irons (he came close to getting two points) and one for the dragons and other CGI stuff, plus one because one is the lowest possible score and minus one for Whalin (boy was he terrible!)."

The acting is not very good.

The special effects could be better (but I heard there were budget-problems)

The story is weak but it works.

But overall I enjoyed this film, because it was a BAD film it was something to laugh at with my friends. And it was an RPG. One thing to say though is that I liked Wayans the most in this film and mostly when I see him in films I hate him...

Yes, it's awful, yes the script is totally hammy, yes everyone overacts, yes characters are in it for no reason, yes the dragons aren't as amazing as they could be... ...but it's fun. It's got some cracking lines in it, and the un/intentional spoof of the Crystal Maze as Ridley (Jimmy Olsen from the New Adventures of Superman) tries to get the Dragon Eye from the smirking Richard O'Brien was breathtakingly funny. (Probably because it was all action and no acting, which was diabolical) You can almost hear him shout 'I can see the Crystal!'. It was worth 100 minutes of tripe for that.

The effects are very good, and the locations are excellent, but it is really let down by the script and chronic overacting. However, as you can't really escape from the former except by muting the film, accept it and just sit back and laugh at the overacting instead. In fact, turn the sound off and dub it yourself, your script could be no worse.

Get some beers in, phone all your friends who like Conan the Barbarian or Hawk the Slayer and don't expect too much. You'll have a great night.

However, if you want a really good fantasy movie, rent Lord of the Rings, Labyrinth or The Wizard of Oz."
2324,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"..it really isn't that good, at all.

I was never a D&D fiend, I personally was just looking for a movie to pass some time from a boring night at home.. it's ironic that I rented the movie to do just that when I would have gotten more entertainment staring at my fireplace for 2 hours.

I'm going to keep this simple, because I promised myself I wouldn't jump in here and review a film just to criticize it but I feel that I have to warn others before they go out and see it. Here are a few of the major problems I had with this film:

1. Acting : Jeremy Irons, Thora Birch, Bruce Payne.. One would expect at least average acting correct? Wrong, overacting.. underacting.. whatever you want to call it, everyone contributed to the bad acting of this film.

2. Props/Costume Design : I'm beginning to wonder if they just drove down to their local Wally World and went to the toys section to pick up all the props/armor/costumes for this movie.. I have never seen worse props in a movie before in my life, and I've seen Feeders.. Staffs, Swords, Armor, all cheesy plastic.. look at the elf's breastplate and tell me thats not the worst of them all, (along side the dragon' staff)

3. Star Wars? : I would love for someone to go through the movie beginning to end and count the Star Wars ripoffs.. Dialogue especially, but right along side some of the sets and scenes, they even threw in an Indiana Jones knock off..

The only saving grace is fairly good special effects at times, most spells were done well, wide views of the locations (castles, towers), etc.. Although I feel the dragons could have been better, the effects were still somewhat impressive overall..

I take one thing with me after viewing the movie, and that is the hope that the ending didn't indicate they were leaving it open for a sequel!

My Rating : 2 of 10"
2325,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"This is a terrible movie. Incredibly shallow and unconvincing acting made worse with a horrible script.

I think the D&D license is held by Wizards of the Coast nowadays, and I guess no one cares that this movie 'invented' fantasy elements that have NEVER EXISTED in the canon of D&D. Beholders (the big eye thingys) don't retract their eye stalks; that's a huge source of their power. Spells aren't cast using some magic powder that's the same for any and all spells (and what kind of spells were those, anyway?). And WHAT WAS THAT sentient purple guy who looked like an evil Man-in-the-Moon from the Mickey D's commercials.

2327,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"As a film student and avid Dungeons & Dragons (Role-playing) player I, for the most part, enjoyed this film. From a film standpoint the cinematography and editing were relatively good. The textbook shot composition worked well for this film. The film didn't require crazy camera angles or other visual eye-candy to keep the interest of the regular movie go'er. The final battle scene in the palace tower was cool with the CG dragons engaged in battle in the background. The hand to hand combat action scenes were edited with a textbook beat and rhythm to them. I also liked the point of view camera movement on each location's establishing shot. The camera would fly and pan around the CG structure, I.E. the palace, to give the viewer this location eye-candy effect. This was cool because most directors would choose to use a still stagnate shot of the exterior of the building to show each location change. Things I didn't care for much. The movie lacked in costume design and had a bit to be desired in story. One of the main antagonist characters (Damodar played by Bruce Payne) had the worst make-up design I have ever seen. The character had this blue lipstick thing going on during the entire movie. I couldn't take this character seriously with this lipstick theme going on. Not to mention the make-up was inconsistent on a few characters during the length of the entire film. I did expect the movie to be based on more of the ""Magic"" motif of the D&D role playing game. For example the female lower level mage (Marina played by Zoe McLellan) had this kickin magical power thing going for her at the beginning of the story, this made me think that she was going to be a more powerful wizard in the story and be more of a protagonist. Again her character had all this magical power at the beginning of the story but later lost it when she could have been supporting her comrades during the hand to hand combat sequences. I half expected her to jump into a battle with a fireball or some type of other useful spell. As a veteran player of the game for almost fifteen years (But yes I do admit I'm no expert) I was wondering why the wizards didn't follow the rules that Gary Gygax had written for the role playing game. For example Marina casted this spell at the beginning of the film to capture two thieves. The spell consisted of a magical rope-like force that wrapped around the two thieves. This is where I have a problem. First she is a low-level mage. So she wouldn't contain the knowledge and power to cast such a spell. Second, as far as I remember the closest lower level wizard spell that even come close to this spell she casted would maybe be ""Bind"" or ""Rope Trick"" or even ""Hold Person"". This spell she casted was nothing like any of those spells. Yes, I know I'm going to extremes here, but if your going to call your movie Dungeon and Dragons you should at least keep to the rules of the role playing game and use the spells listed in the book effectively. I'm not saying that they have totally strayed from the rules of the game. There were a few things that only veteran players would have noticed about the story. For example dwarves don't care for horses they prefer ponies. And elves are slender angelic creatures. Again I know as a filmmaker and screenwriter you have the power to change and create you own themes and spells or rules. I do want to thank the writers of this film for not making it some type of reality story where a group of real-life teens get sucked into some type of ""game porthole"" to find they are playing their game characters. That would have made for a BAD film. So as a movie viewer and D&D player I would suggest to others to view this film for themselves because I liked it."

After seeing the no-name cast and learning of the plot (a young empress...two young thieves...stereotypical evil wizard...save the kingdom...blah blah blah) I feared the worst. Today my fears were realized, as I wasted a few hours of my time watching it. Why is it (that after years of development) the makers of this film basically decided to do ""Disney meets Dragons""? What in the world possessed them to make this a children's movie? Odds are that everyone that has much of an interest in Dungeons and Dragons is far too sophisticated to be even remotely entertained by this sham of a film. In the future I hope that movie makers will realize that the successful fantasy movies are mature movies, not children's movies. I hope that this movie doesn't do so bad as to totally kill the idea of basing films on Dungeons and Dragons. Perhaps next time they will base the movie on familiar characters and places. Anyone that has read R.A. Salvatore's books (NY times bestsellers several times over) knows that they are just crying to be made into movies. Whatever the case, let's hope that Solomon and crew aren't given the opportunity to continue this pathetic story line and its cast of cookie-cutter characters."

As with all my comments i always talk about the acting, and for D&D words cannot describe the hardness of the D&D acting, It couldnt have been worse if it was broadcasted live to us.

Example: (Oh look...Its going to kill us....Oh no what are we going to do...Lets run...Good idea...lets).

One thing this movie needed was more reference to the game and oh god please!!! JEREMY IRONS!!!! no way, Jeremy irons as a bad guy couldnt act his way out of a cloud!!! But the story line and everything else was quite good, the graphics were also impressive, so my ending commment is, If you have a choice between D&D and something like the Mummy Returns see the Mummy Returns or...If you have nothing else to see... go wacth D&D, its not a complete waste of time."

I did play D&D once with some friends in college, and it was rather entertaining. However, this movie does not do it justice.

First, I've seen better acting in most high school drama pieces.

Second, there were a handful of supporting cast characters that added absolutely no value to the movie.

I also loved how the actors weren't huge movie stars, like I heard they were going to use Mina Suvari for Marina's part. The only thing wrong with this movie that I can see is, Courtney should of used some more of the deleted scenes on the DVD. So who cares if the movie is longer. It's just more exitement. And I can't see why they would go through all the trouble of having a baby dragon hatch with computer graphics and not show it in the actual movie. Also, some of the scenes would have explained the movie better. Anyway, I think anyone from ten to one-hundred would like this movie, so go rent"
2337,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"I admit, I read the reviews when this first came out, and I didn't go to see it in the theatre. I thought, 'no way can they do a world as vast as that of D&D any real justice in a feature-length film.' Even as a die-hard D&D fan and even though I found myself chuckling ruefully at a few points in watching this, I really enjoyed the film. YES, a level-two thief is not going to beat a level-10 fighter in combat (guesses here of course), and YES the boy should not have been able to fight like he did at any point in the film; BUT at least the killing of Damodar was with a trademark-thief backstab. YES Marlon Wayans was a silly bit of slang-talking comic relief; but as an experienced thief player I can tell you he did a far better job of playing the persona of a thief than his counterpart there - thieves are supposed to be wisecracking, devil-may-care gadabouts. And YES Jeremy Irons acted like a fading Shakespearian, but evil mages are REALLY evil. You can't gain control of that much power without some of your traditional evil-power-hungry-megalomaniacal madness. Somebody claimed it was too clean; I think the extended periods in the thieves' guild, dungeons, and tavern did a great job of painting both sides of the D&D world. A couple of things I didn't like, though; the heroes go through a maze, which is more of a DM contrivance than a real common occurrence in the world. Also, technical limitations I'm sure, but the writers certainly didn't give credence to the rainbow of races in D&D. Except for a couple (orcs? in a human city tavern?), the non-distinctly humanoid races were not represented . . . no ogres, trolls, what-the-heck-was-the-guy-with-three-eyes-he-looked-like-he-was-from-star-tr ek, goblins, even dwarves of a realistic size. Still, really great movie. I left feeling good about it, and I didn't expect that."
2338,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"""D and D"", was not bad in my opinion. I don't know much about the game but as for the movie, it was okay. The special affects could have been better and the story itself could have been better. Jeremy Irons was pretty good in his role as the villain. In fact, his character, I thought, is what held my interest in the film. He did seem to over act in a few scenes but it did not seem to detract from the film. The hero of the film seemed to lack depth and did not seem to inspire much. This film could have been better if they had casted a different person to play the hero. I have to admit, for anyone who likes the game of ""D & D"", you will mostly likely like this one. I felt this film has many good traits and scenes, it just needed a better presentation to make it come together. If you like ""D & D"", or mysticism that surrounded the medieval times, you will like this one. If you don't, you will hate this one.

Overall, okay but nothing special (5 out of "
2339,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Let me just get this out of the way right now and say that ""D&D"" was an entertaining film, but nothing more than that. Instead of making its own mark and leading the pack in this kind of a fantasy picture, the writers and director relied a little too heavily on other films to steer their own.

Jeremy Irons is the baddie who wants all the power and to rule the fantasy kingdom. Why Irons accepted this role I'll never know. Bruce Payne aids the baddie and appears to still be in character mode from ""Highlander: Endgame"". Payne is definitely much more fun to watch than Irons, though. There's just something about his intensity...

Some have said that the Empress is reminiscent of the one in ""Star Wars--The Phantom Mess"", but I was reminded a bit more of ""The Neverending Story"" minus her riding a dragon in battle. Whatever. It's really unimportant. I have to say that Justin Whalin makes a dashing hero and plays his part rather well. He's a cutie and it's easy to see why Zoe McLellan stays so close to him on their quest to find some scepter that controls the red dragons...and will save their kingdom or something like that. That plotpoint ends up taking a back seat anyway, so just enjoy the visuals. Marlon Wayons does his best as the wimpy sidekick who screams a lot, way too much like Chris Tucker did in ""The Fifth Element"".

Beyond the cast, one would have hoped for a little bit more magic to be seen on screen from mage-in-training McLellan. Instead, she gets to fume and scream a bit herself as well as take on a few henchmen. Whalin gets to appear heroic by having sword fights and going through a death maze (ala ""Spacehunter"" or ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade""). There was one particular point in the middle of the film when Payne is advancing on Wayans and the music changes and I swear that I thought Darth Vader was going to make a cameo. Still, while eye and ear-candy, it doesn't amount to a whole lot and everything the main characters do becomes somewhat pointless by the end of the film.

Speaking of the end of the film, I had to listen to the commentary track on the DVD just to understand what the heck happened. I rather liked the element of tragedy in the story only to be let during the last few seconds with the promise of a sequel (that's what the commentary said) that probably won't see the light of day. If they do, however, I hope they take a good long look at what was bland and borrowed in this film and not repeat those mistakes in the next.

I'll be watching."

2342,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"I've been playing D&D since 1979, and this movie did not have enough of a D&D feel. Of course I stopped playing with the 1st Edition rules, I hoped that more monsters, character classes, armor-types, traps and spells from the D&D world would've been shown in this movie. Where were all the wonderful monsters that D&D players know fondly from the game? I would've loved to see the onscreen representations of some of the famous monsters from the game. The filmmakers should've crammed the movie with tons of references to the actual game, so the D&D fans could pick them all out. The ""dungeons"" in the movie were extremely short. A vital part of the game is about a party working together, but in this movie - the hero Ridley went solo through most of the dungeons, while his companions waited outside -- what was the purpose of that? The ending made little sense, except to make way for a sequel. I would've prefered and ending that reverted to our world, showing a group of gameplayers sitting around a table, finishing up the story we had just seen. The scale of the movie seemed a bit cramped and staged. No attempts were made to combine the sweeping CGI vistas with the live actors. I think they should've left the scenes inside the scroll and the Ridley's dream of the baby dragon intact. On the DVD, you can see these scenes and others under the Deleted Scenes section. I think they ran out of time with this movie, and wanted it released in time for Christmas. If they had done more post production, it may have been a much better movie."

2344,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Now where to start...

The special effects budget was clearly enough for about half the film, since minutes 1-20 contained lots, 80-107 contained lots, and the middle hour had NOTHING.

Every scene change for the first 20 minutes was accompanied by a long drawn out camera pan over the CGI location. After using this constantly for 20minutes it was only seen once again.

Almost every shot of any kind of action was so close in that you saw legs and arms just go flying past and get so utterly disorientated it was scary.

And what the HECK was that bit tacked on the end after the ""looked like the end"" pan out from the tower. ""oh don't worry he's not really dead"".

As for plot. Well it's kinda there. Somewhere. Although they could easily have cut 20 minutes off that middle hour. And yes, the main boy / girl characters kiss. (yes I was shocked too)

Although the kiss happened halfway through the film we never hear about it again and they never get close to each other again except for a hug (woah!) at the end of the film.

And the dwarf. Who is clearly there only to fill the character quotient since his participation in the actual plot is somewhere between zero and non-existent.

If you're not a D and D fan you'll be screaming at it. If you are, you'll be screaming at it. If like me you're neutral, you'll be wondering if it really is possible to sleep in cinema seats.

I avoided the mummy returns and saw this instead. I have the awful feeling I went for the least intelligent film. At least the mummy returns might have a special effects budget for more than 40% of the film.

I feel dirty."

2347,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"This movie is what defines ""nothing special"". You watch it, you like some parts, some you don't, and you will never think about it once you leave the theater.

As a player of the Baldurs Gate computer game, the D&D cosmos is nothing new to me. But in this movie, most of the inherent magic of this fascinating world was simply let out for poor effects and cheap character stereotypes. The female mage has nothing to do but to look nice and to scream in moments of danger. She hardly ever uses her magic abilities, and therefore is a splendid example of the poor role play adaption this movie is. She is no mage - she is simply a damsel in distress.

The humor of the movie also is very simple and nothing to really laugh about. That is, if you leave out Jeremy Irons' incredibly bad acting - his bad mage routine should be added to acting books under the chapter ""how to overplay a character"". But, to be true, those were the most funny moments of the movie, so at least Irons was good for something here...

All in all a rather unspectacular start to the new wave of fantasy films which will accompany the giant blockbuster ""Lord of the Rings"" production. I pray to God that the Tolkien adaption will be far better than this mostly trashy b-movie."
2348,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"During the 1980s, there was always trepidation surrounding the release of board games and especially computer games based upon popular films of the time  who can forget the classic that was Back to the Future'. Almost as a kind of revenge, film-makers during the nineties have taken extremely popular games and turned them into unwatchable nonsense. Dungeons and Dragons' was one of the most long awaited adaptations, and perhaps because of the length of its gestation period, the finished film could never live up to some of the fans expectations. It's a pity though that it fails to live up to any expectations.

Rather than keeping with the ready made plot contained in the classic D&D cartoon series, the film makers have attempted to create a status quo akin to a group of friends playing the game. Indeed, the dialogue at times mimics the creativity of a bunch of game players during a post-pub dungeon hop. For the first half hour of the film, it almost becomes expected that the scene would dissolve into a group of people in home made costumes gathered around a table (a feeling which returns at the film's coda). Instead, sense of disbelief is stretched to its limit as a series of characters without pasts are dragged through the hero's journey, the wind whistling through the pages of Joseph Campbell The Hero with a Thousand Faces' as it sits on the table next the writer's keyboard.

It's a brave move to assume that the audience understands the rules of fantasy as a genre  but despite first glances, it can be as sophisticated or simple as the writer wishes. Here, too much understanding is expected of the viewer. The importance of the staffs is never full explained and neither is how they control the dragons. The important fact (dramatically) that a mage cannot use magic unless she has something to work with is ignored somewhere as well, so for much of the film we wonder why our friends keep getting captured. The Arthurian abilities of Ridley also seem far fetched. Yes, we know he's special, but could you show us how? These are small things, but as they niggle away at us whilst we watch they draw us out of the story.

Perhaps the most likable parts of the film are in the scenes were the actors are not running around and shouting at each other. Justin Whalin shows the charisma of a young Dennis Quaid; Marlon Wayans is more likable here than in Scary Movie' although he could so with trying to be himself and not Eddie Murphy; Zoe McLellan is startling touching as the love interest and could do well in a none genre piece. Richard O'Brien must have been laughed himself stupid at getting to play being keeper of maze again in a fight to the death edition of The Crystal Maze'. And Tom. Dear Tom Baker  who despite his elfin ears managed to produce on the few truly human performances. is said some of the actors don't do quite as well  Thora Birch looks embarrassed to be their in role probably filmed before American Beauty'; Jeremy Irons decides that if you can't see the set, its best shout a lot and grimace; Kristen Wilson looks disappointed that she didn't get to be Storm in X-Men', but her role seems to have been curtailed to simple pronouncements.

But what of the special effects? In order to bring a world to life there has to be some consistency in the magic brought to bear in creating that world. Unfortunately, there is a feeling that a number of different SFX houses were at work, and they all thought they were working on different films. The magic effects are superb, as good as anything seem in The Matrix' and its friends. But its in the imagery of the place, the castles, the landscapes, the dragons, that things become unstuck. Anyone whose played the old PC classic Myst' will be familiar with the standard of rendering. Its almost as though a game was in preparation and the graphics were used here. In a feature film this isn't enough. Dragonheart' proved the sophistication which can be achieved in the imagining of mythic creatures, but the effects here fall short of expectation. We should believe in the world, not sit and marvel at how sophisticated the rendering is  for that I'll go see Toy Story or Shrek.

So overall, a very disappointing experience like many adaptations. Too simplistic for fans, too irrelevant to the average punter, New Line may have made a mistake releasing the film as a curtain raiser to Lord of the Rings'. It's a bit like Lucasfilm offering up Battlefield Earth'. If your average cinema goer thinks that this is the best Fantasy has to offer, you can imagine the rest of that series going direct to video. ***"

2350,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"The D&D universe is one of epic battles, great heroes and very nasty villains. Did this movie deliver any of this, well apart from the last 10-15 mins....NO...not in any way. I knew it was not going to live up to my expectations or even mildy amuse me, when they introduced the ""Comedy Sidekick"" Snails. If you ask me Ridley should have run him through when he didn't want to go along with his plan in the first 5 mins of the film, but you can't have everything. Why does almost every film with great potential need to be ruined by the inclusion of some muppet, who is used to make the weakly cast and developed main characters look good.

Overall, I was very very disappointed with this film, they had the potential to produce something great, and they fluffed it BIG TIME. I wasn't asking for a film so painfully accurate to the D&D universe that you could see people rolling dice during battles, but I was expecting something epic and engaging...and it seems that they didn't even try to achieve that in this film. All I found myself wishing for, was a grisly end for all of the main characters, be they good or evil.

However, IF you've never played D&D or ever read any of the books, AND you like comedy sidekicks then you'll probably think this is an excellent film. However if you are a D&Dphile, my advice would be to aviod this film like the plague."

There is very little to be said about the movie adaptation of the board game Dungeons And Dragons that hasn't been said by many other critics.The one thing that stands above it all,however,is the thing that was apparent before anyone even viewed it which was that it was never going to be as good as it's source of inspiration.There's never going to be as big a thrill watching something played out before you as there is actually playing it for yourself,and so already there are problems.But it's also extremely shocking to see all those involved giving performances in the movie as if it were a Shakesperian film they were starring in,rather than a simple piece of hokum,especially Jeremy Irons as the villain Profion.The dialogue also feels cliched and protracted,which in turn rubs off on the characters concerned.It's not that anyone acting in it is giving a bad performance,they're just over doing it for what it is,being really heavy handed and over emotive.Actor Bruce Payne is getting a reputation as a screen bad guy now,having previously appeared as one in Sweepers and Passenger 57,however here,he's appearing as a henchman to a bad guy rather than the big cheese himself.His appearance with water blue lipstick slapped across his mouth isn't guaranteed not to emote giggles from certain members of the audience,and Marlon Wayans character unsmoothly transcends from being a comic relief guy to a stern and serious individual.The special effects are convincing enough,but are still obviously computer generated.The director Courteney Solomen had no real directing experience before making this,and while a pretty good go has been had at covering this up,the lines still creak through.**"
2353,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"When you hear the ""hero"" of the film use the words ""It looks like some twisted magic experiment gone wrong!"" as his opening line, you know to expect a camp, pantomime film. If you accept this and roll with it, you'll probably enjoy it. The script ranges from poor to dreadful, the FX from good to acceptable and the acting from abysmal(Marlon Wayans)to reasonable (Justin Whalin, Kristen Wilson). Try to ignore both Jeremy irons and Richard O'Brien, who take over-acting to new lows.

The story is simple, many elements of it will strike a familiar chord with anyone who has ever played the game the film is based on - the thieves maze is particularly well observed - but a lot of potentially eye-popping scenes were reduced to mere dressing by under par FX. Props and sets also scream ""low budget"", but at least the film stays away from the chainmail bikini style costumes.

This movie deserves comparisions with Battlefield Earth, Showgirls and Nothing but Trouble. If you like these films, well you'll love this- the sane readers out there will recognize trouble when they see it.

I expected cheese but, well this was something more.

The plot is a direct ripoff from Episode I- all of it. There are scenes lifted from Star Wars and Indiana Jones (badly I might add). There is a dwarf that seems too tall and frankly for most of the film has no lines of dialog- which might be good given the quality of dialog from the other ""actors"".

The film can't decide if it wants to be a dark action film (note: no blood, no real action of any kind) or a light hearted romp (the spare Wayans brother's insulting Jar-Jar Binks impression).

First of all, Jeremy Irons was wretched. I honestly believe that I laughed out loud at every line he uttered (or should I say screamed). It was as though he graduated valedictorian from the William Shatner school of over-acting!! Every line he delivered was accompanied by a painful wince, an annoying voice that I can't even describe, and a strange hand gesture that made him appear seriously arthritic. I do believe he turned to Gargamel from the Smurfs for inspiration. Then there was Thora Birch. Now I know this girl can act, because she did a wonderful job in American Beauty; however, she made a miserable Empress. She delivered each line with the feeling you might expect to find in actors from a first grade school play. And finally, there was Just Whalin, who was okay for the most part, as long has he wasn't attempting to display emotion or pain. I especially enjoyed the movie's emotional climax, when he fell to his knees and wailed like an injured banshee.

Now, I should say that this movie wasn't terrible. It was entertaining mainly because I enjoy being engrossed in a world of magic and dragons. I should say that if you have two hours to spare, you aren't looking for a serious movie, you want to let go of reality, and you want to laugh at some miserable acting -- this is the movie for you!!

Story, characters, actors, computer effects, it all is far from being perfect. But what does it have to compete with? Is the story worse than in Conan, the actors worse than in Xena, the effects worse than in Dragonheart? I´m just glad that there is a movie from the D&D RPG at all, because it supports my fantasy. It´s pretty much the same as with Episode 1, I was really happy to see a lightsaber being used as a cutting tool instead of a weapon, because we used to do just that often when playing the Star Wars RPG. Episode 1 was bad, though, having so many ugly flaws like the speeder race or this supposed-to-be-funny character whose name I don´t wanna write down.

The Empress Savina thinks she's Queen Amidala from StarWars-TPM, even the council-scene is copycated.

Another thing, if the movie was named ""Cute & Blackness""(?) it would have made as much sense as ""Dungeons & Dragons"". Because the movie doesn't bother to take the history of D&D as a fact.

The movie is ""about"" a thief, a dwarf, a warrior, a mage...blah blah blah. Get the point? I didn't care about the plot one little bit, and it's a good thing I didn't because it makes absolutely no sense.

2362,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"I didn't expect much from this film. This is why I enjoyed it. While other fantasy movies create their own worlds with creatures that are hardly familiar to us, this particular one brings to life images that are well known from childhood. Here you will find dragons that spit fire, spiteful wizards, dark tunnels, a brave thief and a beautiful princess.

I thought the sets and computer animations were wonderful. The costumes on the other hand were ridiculous. The soldiers' uniforms looked as if made of plastic. The same applies to the rods and scepters used in the movie. I expected something more sophisticated. On the other hand the names used in the movie indicated some interesting connections. Izmir for example, the name of the empire in the movie, is the Turkish name for the ancient Greek city of Smyrna in the western coast of Asia Minor. There is also another connection between this empire and Turkey: The upper part of the Empress' palace looks like the church of Holy Wisdom in Istanbul, Turkey, typical of the Byzantine and Ottoman architectu"

2364,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"The fact that they named this movie ""Dungeons & Dragons"" might have cursed it. The 'D&D' crowd will bitch that the movie isn't 'authentic' enough. The fantasy genre crowd will bitch because there isn't deep enough roots into an existing popular storyline. The 'general public' will be totally mixed - the FX lovers will enjoy it, the 'drama-lovers' and cutesy Meg Ryan Tom Hanks comedy romance might as well not go.

So how was the movie? If you have been waiting for a movie with a good deal of magic and an effects budget to support it, then D&D is your flick. If you don't mind straying from the D&D paradigm where every type of player is restricted to a strict set of rules (theives can't use swords, etc) and take this movie as ""fantasy with great FX"" - you'll very likely enjoy it.

If the movie looked too slapstick to be fantasy (via the Waylon brother), don't be too hasty. Yes, Marlon was the comic relief portion, but it comes off VERY well; never overdone. Marlon did a very good job. If you thought of him as Jar Jar Binks, relax; he's not. You may be surprised.

If you are looking to compare the movie to other movies (like others here seem to want to) leave that at home. There isn't anything original in film anymore, so get over it. Is the Emporess like Queen Amadala? Let's see .. they are both young and in power... sheeze, give me a break. If anything, the Emporess does a better job in her position of power than Amadala does. Oh, yes, there will be other comparisons - Indiana Jones, Star Wars, etc. Seems funny that people fall back on the ""it imitates too many other movies"" excuse when they want to complain and can't do it intelligently.

In short, if you are remotely interested in this film, MAKE YOUR OWN OPINION. If you are looking to compare it to the D&D game, other movies, etc. - don't go - you won't like it."
2365,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Yes, I am totally serious in my summary, but only because this rather low-rent adaptation of Dungeons & Dragons does not take itself so seriously. But therein lies the biggest problem. Dungeons & Dragons is not just a novel or a video game, it is a canon unto itself with a wealth of material that gives the likes of Superman a good contest. And because of the nature of the game, every story in Dugeons & Dragons, even if it is not necessarily entertaining or compelling, has a certain depth that is absent from this film. A good example would be the Eye Of The Beholder games. Even at their worst, the story that drove the adventures was replete with twists and turns that would have made a great motion picture. Not having played the actual game myself, even though I own one of the handbooks, I did not have any specific expectations when going into this film adaptation. Other than a decent story and some passable acting, that is. So when the first five minutes of the film passed, I was dumbfounded. Utterly dumbfounded.

Aside from the overly dramatic score music and poorly-written narration, the first thing you will gawk at in Dungeons & Dragons is Bruce Payne's bright blue lips. Believe me when I tell you that they are the least of the film's problems. No, the real problem becomes evident when Jeremy Irons, one of the best actors working today, walks in and overacts like he is trying to perform in the midst of a violent hypoglycaemic fit. Having had plenty of those, I am speaking from experience when I say that it is a more plausible explanation than any other offered for Irons' performance, save for director Courtney Solomon actually asking him to act this way. But it gets even worse from there. About seven minutes into the film, we get our first earful of Marlon Wayans as Snails, a Human Thief who sounds like he has been too enthusiastic with the anal probe and the helium. By the time he utters his tenth squeal, you will literally be wondering how a canon with creatures colloquially known as landsharks by the residents can suffer this kind of fool.

About the only redeeming scene in the entire film comes when the aforementioned Payne throws Wayans off a high platform and thus kills Snails stone dead. This has given rise to a convention in all role-playing games where, at the death of a character one is meant to give a rat's bottom about but does not, one yells out ""Snails!"" in their highest, whiniest voice. It is for a good reason. There has never been a character in a film we have wanted to see die so badly. Even Jar Jar Binks had a redeeming moment when he helped give birth to the Empire. Unfortunately, Zoe McLellan and Justin Whalin soon follow this up with a political debate that looks more like a pair of whining children arguing about who is more entitled to the last chocolate bar. Unfortunately, this is not exactly a unique moment in the film, with Thora Birch presenting the heroic side of an argument about whether an absolute monarchy should be set aside in favour of democratic rule in a manner that really leaves her opposition without need to say a thing.

There are a few reasons why I prefer this mess of a film to The Lord Of The Rings. Primary among them is that where I can draw unintentional comedy value from Dungeons & Dragons, Return Of The King so seriously believes it is high art that even its failure to notice that it reads like the result of only reading every tenth page of the novel is excruciating. I laughed at D&D. By the time LOTR finally rolled out its credits for the last time, I was crying. But comparisons to one of the worst film adaptations of a novel in history cannot save D&D from the fact that it is a stunning example that one should be careful what they wish for. For years, vocal fans of the game made it clear they wanted a film made by someone who was a fan of the game, as opposed to ""the suits"", the accountants who really run Hollywood. Well, they got what they wanted, with director Courtney Solomon being a fan so determined to make the film according to the idea of D&D that he had in his head that even his own lack of ability as a director could not stop him.

And that, in a nutshell, is what killed Dungeons & Dragons at the box office. It is one thing to take a film so seriously that no fun can be discerned from the story when it is needed. It is another entirely to treat the thing as a complete joke. Because nobody in the story is taking their part seriously, the entire deal fails to connect with the viewer on any level, which is a fatal error where fantasy stories are concerned. The traditional market for these kinds of stories has been dominated by intellects, or the kind of people who would be reading Heinlein if they were not reading these stories, so treating the genre in such a cheap fashion is not the way to engage your audience. Especially not when the material you are making a mess of has so much potential. A power struggle between the mages and everyone else in the realm is not an easy story idea to waste so utterly. One reviewer once wrote that making a film or game this bad out of nothing is an everyday event, but making a film or game so bad out of source material like this takes a special effort.

Hence, Dungeons & Dragons gets a one out of ten from me. It is so bad one can watch it just to see how terrible films really get."

2367,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Dungeon's and Dragons is an excellent movie. The special effects are great, the story's good and it's well executed. However, there are quite a few people that complain about plot holes and over-acting. Profion (played by Jeremy Irons) is the only one I might consider saying was over-acted, but he's supposed to be at least semi-insane, so it fits. There are a number of small plot holes and some things that need better explanations, but nearly all of them would be fixed with a better cut of the movie. They cut far too much out. It's less than two hours (110 min I think). A couple more scenes and an extension here and there to a few of them and almost every complaint is fixed. The DVD will be Director's Cut and have a lot of extra stuff on it, so that should fix most of the problems. This movie is supposed to be the first of three, but we'll have to see if this one does well enough for the other two to be made. I hope that it does. I urge you to see it. It's great fun to watch.

2368,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"The one line summary pretty much explains the value of this movie. Don't go expecting any great performances or impressive special effects. There are decent images and scenes, but this is an inexpensive movie that is worth seeing at the matinee or second-run. It's been a while since a decent fantasy film has been released, and this one is decent.

The acting was over-the-top and the plot was redux from many other films, but that did not matter. You should go into this movie expecting standard fantasy. Nobody has been claiming this movie is a great dramatical work. It's fun, entertaining, and sometimes goes out of its way to make fun of itself.

The cast has several strong names, but you get the idea they are making fun of themselves and the movie they are in with their performances. Though Marlon Wayans does turn in a good performance as Snails the bumbling thief. However, most of the cast seems to be just learning to act, which adds to the over-acting.

I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 because it was worth my time and in a genre devoid of current movies, it was above average. Is it as good as Highlander (1986), The Princess Bride (1987), Willow (1988), Excalibur (1981), or Conan the Barbarian (1982)? No, but then it is not as bad as Highlander II: The Quickening (1991), Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn (1983), or Leonard Part (1987) ...some of the worst movies of all time.

That said, however, bearing in mind that 'Dungeons and Dragons'is a movie based on an RPG - of which no one story, dungeon, or plot was the direct source of inspiration - then the movie is in itself very entertaining and actually well done.

Soon after that the Lord of the Rings trilogy began, and many people compared this movie to Tolkien's masterpiece... and that's not quite fair isn't it? I must admit that i thought the same way at the time but recently i watched the movie once again and it's not that bad, considering that it tries to create a whole new story, not just reproducing probably the best fantasy world ever conceived. Although the main elements (dragons, mages, elves etc.) are ""borrowed"" from Tolkien's universe there is some potential for a good sequel or something...

No not the kind of crying which involved an excellent movie or a sad story but one which involved laughter and utter hatred toward this movie. Lets start with the acting, Marlon Wayans as a serious character and main one at that being cast made no sense, then Justin Whalin trying to act was hilarious. Him going into an about three minute scream after Snails is killed made me fall out of my seat with laughter.

Next the special effects. While watching, I was just trying to figure out what was floating by with the soldiers. It kind of looked like a meatball with one eye. Next the dragons flying around above the city was about the worst visualization i've seen (I couldn't tell what was a building and what was a dragon.)

Finally the story. When a movie is based off a game, 99% of the time its going to be terrible. I played the original game and it pretty much had no resemblance to this thing. Four people just running around and finding themselves in forests and caverns which don't go along with the story is(if there ever really was one.)

2379,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"This should not have been a difficult movie to make based on the budget had for the talent they were able to put together; the production quality of the props, costume, and makeup; and even the flimsy CGI. All they had to do was put together a simple, typical adventuring quest consisting of a fighter, cleric, wizard, rogue, and barbarian of varying races and have them complete a fun dungeon crawl... maybe sink some of the big budget dollars into a quality CGI dragon or BBG at the very end. Everything else would just have to be practical.

Instead, we got some big political story arch involving a council of mages versus a princess/mage(?) which uses a pair of young thieves and a young wizard traipsing through a uninteresting world on an directionless quest to obtain a McGuffin. Yeah, some other characters show up but they are absolutely pointless to the plot. I knew the story was terrible the minute they made it about the inequality of mages and commoners or some nonsense. Just uninspiring and boring.

It's sad that Jeremey Irons starred in this after such big hits in the 90's. He makes an utter fool of himself in this though. In fact, all of the actors look like buffoons throughout, especially Marlon Wayans playing the dopey sidekick. Bruce Payne really gives it all he has too in delivering some Grade-A garbage dialogue throughout most of the film. The CGI dragons are so bad that it made some of the monsters in the Kevin Sorbo television series, which came out prior to this, look like Lord of the Rings in comparison.

All in all, whoever is as responsible for this fairly big budget disaster should be thrown in the dungeon and fed to the gelatinous cube for an eternity."

I didn't get the chance to see it on the big screen but as soon as I've watched it I knew it was a world I would want to visit again and again. The first thing I loved about this movie was the setting, the world where the characters interact.It's an exotic and dangerous world full of mystery and danger, brought to life with special effects and a lot of dedication. The second were the characters.The villains were superb! Jeremy Irons, who played the main villain, surprised me yet again with how much he imersed himself in this world, and his right hand Damodar, Bruce Payne, played his role perfectly and brought life to this character. The heroes were also well chosen.The main hero Ridley Freeborn is played by Justin Whalin, an odd choice some might say because he is mostly known for his roles in family movies and Child's Play.But some, like I do, know Justin as an action hero! He played a badass soldier named Sutherland in For the Cause aka Warhammer, and proved his worth as a lead character and action hero. In Dungeons and Dragons he shows charisma, wits and he completly dominates both physically and intellectualy his funny but loyal friend Marlon Wayans who added a little comedy flavor to the cocktail this movie delivers. I don't know why Justin was not cast in more action movies but I think is possible that in the future, we might see Ridley in action again! The hero's love interest Marina played by Zoe McLellan was also well cast and does a good job, the same can be said about the empress played by Thora Birch. A strong point mostly for game fans is that we get to see the main character level and get stronger as the story unfolds, like in an actual game. Also a nice surprise for the fantasy gamer is how well the movie portrayed the character's classes and how well they were played. The plot might not impress the gourmet audiences looking for something very complex but it offers a lot of nice surprises and a heartwarming story for all audiences even if they never heard of the games and are not fantasy fans. The music is wonderful and it's allways there to highlight the important moments. Last but not least, the atmosphere in the movie is allmost identical to the one gamers make when they are playing Dungeons&Dragons or a computer MMORPG.If you love fantasy RP games then this is the movie you must see and you will feel that a part from your favorite game was in it!

2384,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"Based on the 80s game this movie is a disappointment. In all of fantasy literature, there are really only about three basic plots, and Dungeons & Dragons has picked the least promising of them: the quest. This means that for the entire running length of the movie, we accompany a bunch of poorly developed characters as they run from place-to-place in search of the one powerful magic item that will save the kingdom and defeat the evil wizard. Of course, since this is Dungeons & Dragons, a lot of the wandering around takes place in poorly-lit tunnels inhabited by unsavory creatures. And the climax, where most of the special effects budget was expended, features an impressive aerial battle between two races of dragon. Only the climax is worth anything and for that we must endure the tedious journey. The set design, while not approaching that of Conan the Barbarian, is also a plus.

The one saving grace, was this early on CGI effects, did not look that horrendous, but it didn't even have that much of it.

You should have a fine balance between the two, which this movie ""could"" have had, if the actors and script were not just so horrible."
2395,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"The Empire of Izmer is ruled by The Mages who oppress everyone else as Commoners. Evil mage Profion (Jeremy Irons) is plotting to depose Empress Savina (Thora Birch) who is trying to institute some equality. He's trying control the dragons. Thieves Ridley (Justin Whalin) and Snails (Marlon Wayans) try to steal from the Magic School. They are caught by inexperienced mage Marina (Zoe McLellan). They find Profion's henchman Damodar (Bruce Payne) killing the master mage while trying to find the Rod of Savrille which controls Red Dragons. Marina manages to escape with the scroll followed closely by the thieves. They encounter dwarf Elwood and elf Norda. Together they battle Damodar in the search for the Rod.

This is a bad movie. It starts bad but it gets even worst. Jeremy Irons is horribly overacting. It gets worst in the climax because he is such a big part of it. Thora Birch seems lost trying act opposite his crazy performance. The clunky dialog doesn't help in the least. The climax also has a lot of CGI. The problem with that is the bad CGI. Dragons should be cool but these look cheesy.

The meat of the movie is bad but not horrible. The group's quest is a series of adventures that feels manufactured like the game itself. Justin Whalin is a second rate actor doing his best. Zoe McLellan is pretty good. Marlon Wayans sometimes go overboard trying to joke around. The costumes look like Hollywood leftovers. The quest is not that bad for a B-movie, but the climatic battle is simply too horrible to watch. The blame has to be laid at director Courtney Solomon's feet. He should have told Irons to dial back a couple of levels. And somebody needs to take a course in writing."
2396,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"So Bad it's good Rating: 5/5 ""Dungeons & Dragons"" is a perfect example of a film that's so catastrophically awful it becomes hilarious. There isn't a single element present that is good. In the fantastical empire of Izmir, ruled by a knock-off of the child-like Empress from the ""NeverEnding Story"" (Thora Birch as Empress Savina), there is trouble brewing. The evil mage Profion (Jeremy Irons, acting so insanely he gives Nicholas Cage in ""Wicker Man"" a run for his money) and his blue-lipstick-wearing crony, Damodar (Bruce Payne) decide to steal the mystical red rod of power, which will allow them to summon the red dragons and take power by force. The protagonists of the film are Ridley (justin Whalin) and Snail (Marlon Wayans, who is so embarrassing as a sidekick he falls just short of wearing Jordans and rapping) who break into the Magic School (that's what it's really called) and get roped up with a young mage/love interest named Marina (Zoe McLellan). They meet up with a dwarf and an elf, included in the film only to make it more fantasy-like, and go on a quest to defeat the bad guys do. Expect Ridley to explore what passes as dungeons and for our heroes to battle some deadly, badly animated dragons.

It's laugh-out-loud hilarious and never gets old because the picture keeps throwing new stuff at you. The acting is terrible, but in a nice variety of ways for instance. Profion is way over-the-top, waving his arms around like a madman, chanting incomprehensible spells that sound like they're being made up on the spot and twisting his face in sneers and grins. The Empress on the other hand, is so wooden you get better performances out of the animated skeleton encountered towards the last third of the film, and that guy has no face! As for the main players, several of them are incredibly bland and feel totally irrelevant to the plot. You could have easily thrown out the elf and the dwarf character because they contribute nothing at all.

The story is terrible and feels like a generic fantasy film with a couple of Dungeons and Dragons elements thrown in. We've got a random monster who shows up for a single scene and then disappears, just so we can have D&D players go ""I get that reference!"" but otherwise the film is filled with weird-looking humanoids that would be more at home in an episode of Star Trek than in an epic fantasy film. The sets here are so incredibly cheap it is astounding. Some scenes are clearly shot against a bad green screen and you can almost see an aura surrounding characters as they talk in front of these big, elaborate castles. Other shots are clearly inside a large library or inside a cathedral that was not built for the film. It's pretty hilarious to see the camera pan around, showing elaborate paintings that in no way fit, as if the editor mistook them for some of the special effect guys' best work and said ""The rest of this movie looks awful, but people have got to see this!"" Mostly, ""Dungeons and Dragons"" is set in unconvincing dungeons, markets or forests that were probably borrowed from a TV show that had just finished wrapping up, with a bunch of random bones or skulls thrown in to look more menacing.

The most memorable and laughable elements of the film have to be the special effects. I understand that this film had a somewhat limited budget, about $40 million dollars. That's not a ton of money so I don't expect the creatures here to look as good as the dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park"", but this is a whole new level of bad. Someone working on this film was incredibly proud of the CG castle they built and they show it off constantly, but no matter how much you pan up and down, it still looks terrible. Even worse are the dragons. I realize that the film is called DungeonS and DragonS, but if you can barely create one CG dragon, don't include a battle where hundreds of them are flying unconvincingly, spitting fireballs at each other. One of the first scenes features a dragon being killed and the movie tells you right away it is going to be cheap, unconvincing and laughable because the dragon bleeds CG blood. Do you know how easy it is to shoot blood pooling and dripping over stone steps? You just need some corn syrup and food coloring, or at the very least some red paint! They couldn't even get that right, what hope do any of the other creatures here have? The worst offender in terms of bad costumes (most of the armor looks like spray-painted plastic) them all is the elf Norda (Kristen Wilson, looking like a Vulcan from ""Star Trek""). Ever see one of those paintings, perhaps on the side of a van where a tough-looking barbarian chick has her arms in the air, swinging twin swords? Half the time she's wearing a breast plate that looks like it was painted onto her skin? This elf has exactly that. Literally, she's wearing a breast plate; complete with individual cups and a belly button for extra sexiness. It's impossible to miss because the camera constantly shows her from the neck down. Had we not received many shots of Damodar's epic codpiece, I'd call her boob-plate the most awesome piece of armor in the whole picture.

Once in a while, you see a movie that's so bad it earns itself a place in the hall of fame. This is easily the worst fantasy film I've seen. It's a series of colossal mistakes immortalized on DVD and it's glorious. Forget your standard comedies with your Eddie Murphys, your Jim Carreys and your Adam Sandlers. You want to laugh long and hard? Check out ""Dungeons & Dragons"". I love it! (On DVD, January 24, 2014)"
2397,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"I hate to love and I love to hate this film - It's campy, cheesy -- but so much fun.

What I liked about the movie was the idea of a movie based on D&D. I also enjoyed some of the special effects and costuming. I felt the movie was cheesy yet not all that cheesy like ""The Sword and The Sorcerer"" (which I actually like despite the cheesiness). There is a comical merit to this movie that only fans of Dungeons and Dragon could appreciate if they would give the movie another chance.

Although Dungeons & Dragons (2000) received some of the worst critic reviews, I still think the movie is fairly good and unfairly rated way too low on IMDb. No the film is not all that good but it does have entertainment value.

Where are the kobolds?! Haha

9/10"
2398,Dungeons & Dragons (2000),3.6,Courtney Solomon,"I didn't think it was too bad of a movie, although I have to agree with a few people about some roles that may as well not have been there. I think much of the venom is about this not being related to the Dungeons & Dragons series or game.

Most of the main roles are played by teenagers, so this would suit as a family movie for children who aren't young enough for Disney cartoons but old enough for some live action that won't give them nightmares.

Acting is overall pretty good. It doesn't feel like a budget movie, and certainly doesn't show to be a budget movie with the dragons. You really do feel that they put a good amount of effort to make everything look convincingly realistic, but what is disappointing is that half the cast don't even have a role. They'll do or say something once or twice but they hardly do or say anything else that actually contributes their character to the movie. You start to forget they're actually there as the movie is centred on the main hero, girlfriend, and protagonists.

And as for the ending it was something that was slapped in a year later without thinking about how the audience is going to relate it to any part of the movie. It leaves you confused asking yourself what just happened because it didn't happen anywhere else in the movie and there's no reference anywhere to explain why it would happen. It was an effort to make it not seem as depressing but the writer should've at least have thought of adding something somewhere else in the movie to explain why it ended like it did or an explanation at the very end instead of ""don't question the gift you've been given."" In fact it seems that there is a lot of unanswerable questions in the movie with the excuse that it's not to be questioned, and it leaves you a bit frustrated because you want answers to understand the movie, not to be left guessing why some people weren't allowed to help or why things happened the way they did. It becomes nonsensical jibber jabber that screams out badly written because the author couldn't be bothered to put in an explanation and left it to our imagination, but there's only so much our imagination can tell us and without any clues anywhere else you may as well say ""they can't help rescue the girl because they ate bread for breakfast."""

2401,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"Well, I didn't like it. Or, at the least what I mean is that I just saw a movie with tons of plot-holes, childish themes, and so on. However, you better believe my kids loved it. My son actually hooted and hollered when Sharkboy started fighting the plugs. He grabbed my shirt and motioned for me to watch, even though I already was. I think I just witnessed my son discovering his first hero.

My daughter laughed and laughed. She loved Lavagirl. She thought it was hilarious when Lavagirl zapped Sharkboy because he said someone else was prettier. And my daughter is old enough to understand the themes of pursuing your goals and remaining strong in the face of discouragement. So I think she walked away very pleased with the film. She said she wants to be Lavagirl for Halloween.

If you're 16+ this movie is a loser. You won't like it, and that explains all the low scores you're seeing here. This movie just isn't for adults. But if you are a parent looking to entertain your kids, this movie works. And if you are reading this near the end of 2005 or later, you should probably know that renting this as a video will be a fine way to keep your kids occupied.

2402,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"The Adventures of Sharkboy & Lavagirl

This film is absolutely not for children. But is a postmodern masterpiece. It is a surrealistic nightmare on par with Eraserhead, as a young boy uses dreams to escape from the ennui of average suburban life. The purposely amateurish CGI work is an obvious satire of the blatant overuse of computer generated imagery in modern films. Additionally, the 3D work is a subtle undermining of the corporate film industry's reliance on this gimmicky technique. It is a psychedelic and stylistic tour de force, by far Rodriguez's best film. The script is a powerful exercise in stream-of-consciousness writing. You must see this film, but put the kids to bed first!

"
2403,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,Hello everyone. I'm sure everyone doesn't care about this movie anymore. Since I'm writing this review in 2019. I just have to say my thoughts about it though. I am 17 now. And saw this movie in 2007 when I was 5 two years after the movie came out. And I need to share an experience my friends and I had recently. We were all at a trivia for our school when suddenly we saw a question that reminded us of this movie. We had all seen it since it was a childhood film of ours and we absolutely loved it. So after that trivia night. We went straight to my house. Found it on on demand. And watched the whole thing. Sure. The movie has poor CGI and it has fart jokes. But half the fun of watching the movie is making fun of it as you watch. It's a children's movie. Made in 2005. What do you expect? But it doesn't matter. Cause I can almost guarantee that your children will be inspired by the creativity of this movie. And will want to dress up as the characters for Halloween. This movie is amazing because it brings kids together. And really stirs up their creative side. And if a group of 15-17 year olds can laugh and have a good time watching this movie. Your kids definitely will. Thank you for reading.
2404,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"I hadn't planned on wasting my time reviewing this mess, but there are some subtleties that crept into my consciousness after the second forced viewing which may enhance a prospective viewer's experience.

First of all, this movie obviously was designed for younger kids. That fact alone has a detrimental effect on a review done by an adult (as can be seen by previous reviews). However, it should be noted that a movie for the target audience will most likely be attended by their parents or guardians, and should be at least bearable for them also. This movie falls short in that regard.

My son, who is 5, absolutely raves about this movie, and will no doubt wear out the DVD in the next few weeks. But my younger brother, who is 17, walked out five minutes into it. Kids under 12 will probably be best entertained by Sharkboy & Lavagirl. It is a very colourful movie with a lot of motion and many bizarre graphics. There is nothing offensive in this movie by the way. Even the ""fight"" scenes are mild and clean.

Now, the main subtlety on my mind is that Sharkboy (who was the best actor in this colourful, but mindless drivel) has obvious hidden talent. This movie, however, was not the right venue to expose that talent. Sharkboy moves well in action scenes and would be more aptly suited to a martial arts style role. Also, Sharkboy has a wide range of facial expressions (although the ones emphasised by this movie consisted mainly of scowls and frowns). With continued training, suitable roles, and of course (and most importantly) proper direction, Sharkboy could go far with his acting career. Also, he is a decent looking lad, which seems to be a requirement for an acting career these days. I'm certainly hoping we'll be seeing more of Sharkboy in the future.

Another noted item: If you have the 2D version, it seems to be far superior to the 3D. My son thought the glasses were fun the first time, but after that he didn't want anything to do with them and now only watches the 2D version. Possibly this 3D effect is better if viewed in a theatre.

I'm giving out a rating of 7 for this title, simply because it certainly has the ability to entertain the kids...which was its purpose I'm sure. I would definitely recommend Sharkboy & Lavagirl if you have younger children. For adults it has no value whatsoever."
2405,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"I put this movie on for my 3 girls - 6 1/2 and 4 year twins earlier this week. They LOVED IT! It is definitely for the younger crowd and you need to take the movie for what it is.... a kid movie. Fortunately, I did record the movie on the DVR and they have watched it every day sometimes twice a day.

Also, since the boy in the movie has a dream journal, my oldest started to write in her journal again. Any movie that gets a kid to write has got to be OK.

Also, we watched the 2D version and seemed great. I really didn't know that there was a 3d version until no"

2408,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"I can't remember the last time a movie confused and tormented my filmgoing soul as much as this movie did. Everything inside of me, everything in me that loves Shawshank Redemption and Vertigo and Raging Bull and all these great great great classic movies tells me that Sharkboy and Lavagirl was awful. And it was. Drastically awful. And I enjoyed almost every minute of it. Let me try and explain it this way - I have written ongoing lists of the greatest films ever made, and the worst films ever made, and Sharkboy and Lavagirl is the only movie I've ever seen that has gotten a placement in both lists for me.

Sharkboy is about a young child named Max who dreams up wonderful fantasies and adolescent superhero type adventures. Eventually he travels into this dream world aided by the aforementioned Sharkboy and Lavagirl as they fight to keep the dream world a happy go lucky place from the evil Mr. Electric. So there's the story. Simple, childish, and a bit reminiscent of Neverending Story. I knew this plot before my 6 year old cousin made me watch the film and I sighed. What a waste of two hours this would be. Then something strange happened. I got a chill. Then Lavagirl and Sharkboy appeared and took Max into their spaceship, and I got more chills. Throughout the course of the movie, especially in the end, I was enthralled and received more goosebumps than when I watched Braveheart, much to the embarrassment of my dumbfounded girlfriend.

I have no idea how to explain my reaction to the film. I was pleasantly surprised, obviously, and I had a lot of fun watching the movie (I'm excluding the terrible 3-D version of the film, which is a pointless distract-or and takes away a lot of the magic). Then why am I only giving this movie 5 stars out of 10 (a middling mark to avoid giving it a 10 or a 1)? For the same reason why the movie is both on my list of most hated and most loved - it's a bad movie. To say it's a guilty pleasure to me would be underestimating guilt and pleasure. The script is silly, the special effects are slapdash, the editing is at times incoherent, the acting is atrocious, and there are moments where even my 6 year old cousin grimaced at the lame dialogue. But damned if this movie isn't a lot of fun.

So I can't really recommend the movie to anyone over the age of 10. I still can't believe that I, a 17 year old classic film lover, enjoyed this movie as much as I did. But I can definitely tell that it's a movie younger kids, especially boys (for I'm pretty sure every boy this age has dreams and fantasies just like the ones in the film) will love. I harkin this bizarre feeling I have for Sharkboy to when you find an old cartoon you used to love as a young child and watch it again. Even though you're reciting the lines and the songs like you did when you were young, you know deep down that if it wasn't a childhood favourite and gave you so much nostalgia, you'd hate it just as much as everyone else. This is what this movie was like for me. It was the childhood flick I never got to see. Maybe that warrants a recommendation. Maybe still not. I really don't know - you'll have to see it for yourself and find out.

Or maybe not."
2409,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"This movie makes no sense- at least, not in the linear, neat, tidy, world of adulthood. But, it captures the messy, gritty, disjointed, weird, raw, non-linear, funky, wild, whimsical, internally inconsistent world of true childhood fantasy better than any film I can remember. The story is based off the ""dreams"" and stories of the director's then 7 year old son. As a mother and teacher, I can tell you that while the characters and situations are unique, they are also completely representative of the types of stories and imagination games that I have heard again and again.

My own children have certainly created their own superheroes steeped in the same balance of derivative lore and imaginative elements that Sharkboy and Lavagirl possess. When faced with similar fantasies played out on screen, my children responded gleefully. Heck, even before we got the DVD home their imaginations had been so captured by what they read on the box that they could not stop discussing it. And, once they had viewed the film, the conversation continued (and continued and continued!). Almost immediately, characters from the film began showing up in my children's own pretending games- only, not *quite* as they had existed in the movie. The characters grew and evolved and were changed and fluffed until they fit seamlessly into my daughter's world of ""Sigalates"" and my son's ""Robotland"".

In other words, the film did beautifully what all good fantasies do- it inspired others to create, examine and expand their own. In my opinion, that is a near complete success."
2410,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"I took my 9 year old son to Shark Boy and Lava Girl expecting to see a movie for kids. I saw a movie for kids. Yes, the story was predictable and the acting could have been better. Many scenes had my son at the edge of his seat. He has a wild imagination and enjoyed seeing a movie about a boy with a similar imagination. Taylor Dooley is adorable, and Taylor Lautner has some great moves in the movie. I asked my son for a quote about the movie: ""It is exciting, adventurous, and the 3-d effects could have been a little better, but if it wasn't 3-d it wouldn't be good at all"". It's a kids movie and my kid liked it, maybe yours will too."

I saw the trailer for this movie, and thought it looked well... like a bad idea. But then I heard that it was his son's idea, and I did warm up to it. That said I didn't go to the theater expecting very much, but I knew I wanted to watch it with the mindset of a child. I have a younger brother, and now that I have seen it... I want to take him. But wouldn't have taken him without seeing it first, as he is still quite young. So my girlfriend and I went, and after a heated debate about film with some cinematic idiot while my girlfriend was in the washroom, we went in to see what it was all about.

So I'm not going to write out all the thing I liked it didn't like as a play by play on this movie. The one main thing that I really hated was the constant puns. But really, if I was a kid, I really think I would like it, a lot. It didn't seem all that different to me than any of the spy kids, and I plan on taking my little brother to see if my theory is true. The 3D worked on me, and while things weren't flying in my face the whole time, it did give the movie a strange depth.

So what can I say, I was in no way expecting cinematic brilliance but I did enjoy most of what I say created before me. I'm 20 years old, and I think I understood what they were trying to do.

So, I don't know... give it a chance. Take a kid to see it, or just try to enjoy it for what it is. But try to remember this, when you are a kid your imagination is insane. My brother tells me the most foolish, crazy stories... because he is a kid. The movie lets imagination run free, and I think that is a good thing."
2416,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"This movie doesn't really need a review. If you have a boy between the ages of 5 and 12, you are probably going to have/get to see this film so here's what to expect:

More of the same... only less. Sorry if that doesn't make sense but it will. More of the same because it's just like ""Spy Kids 3-D"" on the way it looks and unfold. It looks like a video game and is very predictable. Less is because there is, unfortunately, hardly any good 3-D sequences. Nothing pops out at you the way it did in SPY KIDS except for when someone sneezes or throws something, and that is not too often. The 3-D in the action scenes was poor and barely noticeable. You can't expect too much from the RED AND BLUE 3-D but this was a step backwards from SPY KIDS.

The good news is that you will probably not get a headache from the 3-D like SPY KIDS. My 6 year old loved it and did not say a word throughout (a minor miracle), so i guess it does what it is supposed to do. Entertain the kids."
2417,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"I came into the movie with very low expectations. The 3.5 rating on IMDB and all other negative stigma revolving around this title left an impression at first. But, let me tell you, DO NOT listen to those people. I came into the movie, and within the first 5 SECONDS I was already gripped into this story that hasn't even begun yet. As I progressed through the movie, I only got more and more baffled by all of the negative reviews and comments people were leaving. EVERYTHING about this movie is perfect. Everything was done with the utmost care and all the characters are deftly woven into deep, relatable characters that you really care about and want to succeed. The music is fully orchestrated and truly epic, a soundtrack to truly fit the eminence of everything else in the movie. The CGI in the movie is done extremely well, with certain camera tricks and acting makes it look real. I must say all the computer engineers did a great job on their part, precise to the smallest polygon or pixel. The story is an absolute roller-coaster, one emotion to the next, each scene more breathtaking than the last. In short, everything about this movie was perfection in every aspect.

In conclusion, do not trust the low IQ nonintellectual degenerates that call this movie ""trash"" or ""only kids stuff"", this is a movie, like many others, which is only for intellectuals and requires a very high IQ to truly understand the depth of what is playing on your television screen. Go see Sharkboy and Lavagirl now, that is, if you're intellect is high enough."

The roller coaster part was still pretty funny. My favorite part was the Land of Milk and Cookies, which a 10/10 would be generous to give this movie after seeing this part.

2423,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"A colorful and occasionally imaginative film, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl (In 3-D!!!) is an overall disappointment, a movie that had good intentions at the beginning, but devolved into a cheesy ""message for our youth."" The movie revolves around Max (Cayden Boyd), the picked-on grade school student who would rather create his own world rather than live in the real one. Of course he's picked on by class bully Linus (Jacob Davich), of course his parents are always fighting (David Arquette and Kristin Davis), and of course Max lives life as a miserable school student who has very little going for him. Writer/director Robert Rodriguez formulated the entire movie, from story to special effects, based on inspirations provided by his children. There are reasons that most movies, even the bad ones, are not made by children. The movie is well meaning, but relies on too many familiar story devices: class bullies, mean teachers, quiet kids who save the day. We've seen this movie before, but the colorful, Super Mario-Mushroom Kingdom-like worlds that inhabit the movie does add some to the entertainment value. Max is taken to his dream world, known as Planet Drool, by Sharkboy (Taylor Lautner) and Lavagirl (Taylor Dooley), the two superheroes of the world. Each superhero contains some depth, not as much as the superheroes in The Incredibles, but the nice little subplot of each character trying to find their place in the world was a nice touch. For instance, after one difficult scene to watch, we now know Sharkboy cannot rap well at all. Otherwise, the characters are each have one note. George Lopez hams it up, most likely intentionally to offer a cheese element to this movie, but I found his characters to be annoying. The movie's plot lacks any imagination, and the world of Planet Drool does feature some creativity, but not enough to save an otherwise pedestrian family feature. This movie is Rodriguez's second foray into the 3-D genre, and though I did not use the 3-D glasses while viewing the movie, the scenes accenting the technology are pretty obvious to the casual observer and distract from the overall viewing experience. I really enjoyed the visual style Robert Rodriguez employed in Sin City, and that movie may have even been enhanced with a few 3-D moments, but Sharkboy and Lava girl was a move in the opposite direction for the maverick director."
2424,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"After attending the premiere of this film (see comments below) I was amazed that it was poorly reviewed until I saw it at a local theater *without* polarization, multiple digital light projection, an IMAX screen, and state-of-the-art 3-D/non-disposable glasses. Now I know why people complained. What a mess.

All I can say is this: Robert Rodriguez's cinematic prowess exceeds most theaters' current technology. This amazing kid's film is great fun when viewed digitally. Seeing the polarized version not yet shown outside Austin was like stepping inside a View Master projector -- something I always wanted to do when I was a kid. Unfortunately, what Robert has conjured up can't yet be seen the way he designed it. Someday soon, perhaps!

--------- earlier comments, posted in June 2005:

Little did I know yesterday that when my eight-year-old granddaughter and I went to see The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl in 3-D we would be viewing a polarized print of the film made exclusively for the Austin premiere. As Robert Rodriguez explained what we were about to see there was no way to imagine beforehand how the 3-D experience would be transformed by the killer combo of the polarized version shown on an IMAX screen through multiple DLPs. Once the movie started, however, I immediately realized I was watching something light years beyond anything I had yet seen. Trust me when I tell you that when Rodriguez waved his magic wand over the audience we caught an unforgettable glimpse of a child's dreams, as well as the future possibilities of cinematic fantasy.

Don't listen to those who say there's nothing new to be had here, or that the story's derivative, or it's just for kids. Forget what you hear from cynical reviewers unable to momentarily access their inner child. This story, written by a kid for other kids, hasn't been tainted by anyone's opinion about keeping the older film-goers entertained through adult-themed inside references and innuendo.

In making this film, Robert Rodriguez has wisely protected and preserved his son Racer's unique vision without the addition of dumbed-down ""mature"" wisecracks. Mr. Rodriguez, along with his producer--who just happens to be Robert's wife and Racer's mom, Elizabeth Avelan--knows that when it comes to children, play *is* their work. By respecting and valuing the realm of childhood imagination, this unique family team together share a story with us about the myriad ways creative thinking can impact the real world. Awe and wonder are not treated lightly here but rather offered to viewers in a much less adulterated form than that to which we have become accustomed.

Today when I think about it, I simply close my eyes and smile."

2426,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"Ten-year-old Max (Cayden Boyd) is having problems at his new school, where he is picked on by classmates and teachers alike after telling them about his superhero friends Shark Boy and Lava Girl (Taylor Lautner and Taylor Dooley). Everyone thinks he's making them up until one day, they show up to whisk him off to Planet Drool to help them fight the evil Mr. Electric (George Lopez) and Minus.

The plot sounds like a film that only kids will like. However, it has Rodriguez behind the camera and he did a good job with the first two Spy Kids movies. Unfortunately, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D is no where near as good as his previous work. Besides for Rodriguez, I didn't really have high hopes for the film Spy Kids 3D was awful and the trailers made this film seem like a joke. While watching the film, I thought it really was a joke. It was really cheesy and it was quite bereft of entertainment. I was hoping the film would start picking up from the weak start. Unfortunately, it didn't.

The acting is horrible which is surprising since the kids in Spy Kids were pretty good actors. Taylor Lautner, who plays Sharkboy, does the worst job and he gives a really wooden performance. Taylor Dooley, who plays Lavagirl, isn't much better and her performance is pretty weak. George Lopez just makes a fool of himself and he gives an over the top performance. David Arquette and Kristen Davis both give decent performances but they don't really appear in the film. The lead, who is played by Cayden Boyd, also gives a wooden performance. I know they are just kids but their efforts felt a little weak.

I am really disappointed with Robert Rodriguez. The direction was really weak and the editing seem to have been done by a child. He spent too much time on the style instead of the story. Sadly, the film isn't even that stylish and it just looks like a mess. The story is pretty cheesy and lame. I know it was written by a kid but it was still pretty weak. Since the story is weak, the film is very dull. The sad thing is that the movie is only 85 minutes long but it feels so much longer since there is very little here to actually enjoy. The special effects are also pretty bad and they left me with a headache. In the end, this family film is better left on the shelf. Rating 2/10"

This movie would be good if it was used for interrogation. If forced to watch it, anyone would do anything or say anything just to be spared. I think the acting was horrible by all who was in the movie. I would like to say something more positive about this movie but I can't seem to think of anything. As with most kids my daughter will watch it many times over, she doesn't ask me to watch it with her anymore. My daughter absolutely loves it though and it is geared toward kids so I guess in that respect it should be rated higher but not by m"

With a plot (if you can call it that) that is a rip off of The Wizard of Oz (kid goes to a fantasy world where everyone is a representation of people that kid interacts with)and a few kids books and one or two graphic novels (a kid dreaming up super heroes who become real is not even a remotely new concept). The movie tries really hard to get you interested in the characters but you just can't, even when Lavagirl or Sharkboy are in danger the overall response is apathy. The humor was received in the very same way no groans no anything.

Most of the adults in the theater i saw it in had to be woken up by their kids when it was over perhaps the best summation comes from the mouth of my 8 year old who said ""That was the most boring adventure movie i ever saw."".

Sorry Mr. Rodriguez but you can put glitter (in this case 3D) on a pile of manure and it's still a pile of manure."

2432,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"This is sort of a double review cause me and my girlfriend watched this together and we both have ""thoughts"" about it.

My 9yo cousin gave us this movie just cause he liked it...he even got us a couple pairs of 3d glasses to watch it with.

Both of us thought the movie was kid junk, but really isn't that what it was supposed to be? There were some fun spots though.

TRAVIS: Most of the characters I hated. (Too bad Mr. Electric didn't do away with some of em before he was defeated.) They were weak and poorly acted...esp. Max. But I liked Sharkboy for the most part. He had that cocky attitude that sort of appeals to me. And, although not original, some of his one-liners were cool.

ANNETTE: Travis is a bit harsh (as usual), but I'll agree with him about weak and poorly acted characters. I couldn't even identify with Lavagirl, although I thought she was quite attractive. Sharkboy was a really cute guy though. Mr. Electric/Teacher was nothing short of annoying.

TRAVIS: Story was really lame, but it's probably good enough for younger kids. It pretty much bored me tho. Some of the 3d was okay and I noticed it looked a heck of a lot better on our LCD TV than the old one.

ANNETTE: Yes. The story was very weak. But it was colourful, and as Travis noted, should appeal to a younger audience. 3d was fun, but not the best I've seen. We watched this on a 27-inch LCD screen with quite nice results.

ANNETTE: I thought the scene where Lavagirl zaps Sharkboy out of jealousy was the cutest part of this movie. And the way Sharkboy copied the tone of the Jurassic Park character's false calm in his ""yell...scream"" comment when they were on the ""train-of-thought"" was sort of humorous.

TRAVIS: Yeah Annette. You would like that zapping scene! My favourite scene was when Sharkboy says ""ouch"" with that sh*t-eating grin on his face when Lavagirl kisses him.

Well, anyhow, as you can see, we didn't totally abhor this movie. Although I think we both agree the only decent acting was by Sharkboy. For the most part this movie was boring. But that's most likely because we are too old for it. If you've got younger kids, it will probably entertain them adequately. Avg. rating=5.

TRAVIS: I rated this a 4 cause it seemed to be cranked out without much thought. With some extra work it could have been a lot better. The only reason it gets as high as a 4 is cause I liked Sharkboy.

ANNETTE: I rated this a 6 because it seemed to appeal to the audience intended. But I also agree that with more time and attention there certainly could have been a lot of improvement. Perhaps if Rodriguez decides to make a sequel, he will obtain a better story with better actors and surprise us all."

2434,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"The Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl In 3-D, is a live action film in which during the film you wear a pair of cardboard cut out glasses (given to you upon entering the film) and you put the glasses on when the screen tells you to (ninety percent of the film is in 3-D so you need to wear your glasses). The film is about a young boy named Max, who keeps a record of his dreams and one day shares with his class a dream he had about two superhero kids named Sharkboy and Lavagirl. After telling the class they all laugh at him and his teacher Mr. Electricidad, tells him to stop dreaming and one of the kids who bullies Max, named Linus steals his dream journal. Things also aren't going too well at home because Max's parents always seem to be fighting. One day at school Max's dreams come to life where after a tornado Sharkboy and Lavagirl appear to take Max with them to the planet Drool. While there they have to stop the evil Mr. Electric, who is turning the planet into an unhappy place to be. I usually tend not to see family films but the film is written and directed by Robert Rodriguez (who based this film on an idea he got from his son) who also directed this year's Sin City, which I liked a lot and plus I have always wanted to see a film in 3-D where I would have to wear a pair of cut out glasses so I decided to see this film. I was pleasantly surprised. The Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl In 3-D, is very creative and interesting and has a lot of neat visual sight gags with the 3-D glasses and the story is also fun and entertaining and I think that with the 3-D effects and the creative and fun story that kids will love this movie. Parents will also find this movie imaginative and entertaining and should be able to have some fun with the 3-D glasses as well. A fun family film that is entertaining and has a lot of neat eye candy."
2435,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"Using the Spy Kids franchise name as a potential boost, this movie lacks the creativity to be more than a direct to home offering.

As others mentioned, the 3-D was sub-par and the story was lacking that must see feel. The characters are over the top geared more to be made fun of than laugh with.

Having a kid movie is fine, in light of all the more abrasive elements out in the world, but making a bad move!

Plus marketing it to be the vein of Spy Kids is bad planning on part of the film makers. It is NOT Spy Kids, it's trying to be one but falls way short.

Children will go to see it if other kids are going, but I don't see this film as being a repeat performer as a must have kid classic. I doubt every kid that sees it will remember it the following week, unless someone is making fun at it.

Parents are better off sticking with the classics then wasting money to have their kids be bored with this flick!"
2436,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"This is the most awful and boring kids movie in the history of kids movies. It's about some kid named Max(Rosie O'Donnel is more convincing than him) that has stupid fantasies of superheros that are bad actors. It's a rip-off of Wizard of Oz and Peter Pan, and the only laughs are because of how annoyingly stupid this is. There are several horrid one liners told by Sharkboy(Lavagirl's hair catches on fire and he says, ""Let her cool off some steam"".) Any good reviews that you read of this are from kids 3 and under that learned to type, or mentally disabled adults. David Arquette lends his bad acting to an extremely pointless and brainless part. I had to cringe when Sharkboy started singing an off tune and non sensible song. One of the lines from the song is, ""Go to sleep you little bleep.""....what? What's a little bleep? Also, the 3-D was horrible and was so dark that I could only stand the first 2 minutes of it, then the glasses went off. All the other people in the theater were either sleeping or putting guns up to their heads if the movie didn't end in a minute. Don't see this horrible movie ever. After you see it, you'll be depressed.

My rating-0%-F- 90 minutes(way too long). rated PG for poopy humor and some ugly computer generated action."

First I would like to say that I watched Spy Kids and loved it. Almost all the movies I watch are kids movies, in fact. This movie was a disaster.

The acting was horrible - even the Teletubbies can do better. The plot is just about as lame as it can get. I mean, Lava Girl spills the plot early in the movie, and in a flat tone. Even in the scary parts, the actors sound as though they're reading their lines of a paper. The whole movie is dry and tasteless and very boring. Even the supposed climax is la"

The plot-pointless adults wandering about (the alternatively wooden and simpering David Arquette and Kristin Davis) to the overt posturing by the kids (especially Taylor Lautner) kept me checking my watch every so often. George Lopez was the one slightly bright spot of the film, but even his caricature teacher or ""Electricity"" villain wore thin after the first half of the film.

Again, my boys and their friend loved it; children this age rarely catch gaping plot holes when sharks are jumping at them from the screen or a kid's karate chops can defeat an ornery electrical cord.

2449,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"Robert Rodriguez stunned the cinema world about a dozen years ago with the low budget El Mariachi, a story of mistaken identity, a lethal guitar case, and a mariachi who just wants to play his instrument. Since then, the director has not had to scrounge for money and exceeds expectations with movies as varied as Spy Kids and Sin City.

After seeing the lava scene in Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over, director Rodriguez' son, Racer, came up with the story for The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl. Dad then creates a song of praise to that imagination, certainly not in short supply in the Rodriguez family. Max (Cayden Boyd) dreams and makes real the fantastic heroes of his mind. The film labors to be cute and instructive, two characteristics better left by themselves in movies or kept the province of artists like animators at Dreamworks.

One hero of Max's imagination can melt whatever she wants by ejecting lava; the other can do considerable damage with his teeth. Max's school bully and the electronics teacher are transformed through Max's imagination into look-alikes of Reddy Kilowatt and Flash Gordon's evil Ming the Merciless. Thus ensues an adventure not as sharp as Spy Kids nor accomplished as Frank Miller's Sin City.

The didacticism (exhortations to believe in your dreams, dream with your eyes open, change your life through your dreams, blah, blah) is heavily administered through speechifying at almost every turn. Even the graphics are imperfect, cumbersome, dull, and by contemporary standards, pedestrian. Lava and lightening, sharks and ice cube monsters look like elementary school creations.

Max has a McCauley Culkin innocent look without the effeminate innocence and wiliness that made us feel comfortable when he was home alone. The principals, Boyd and Dooley, lack acting skills beyond awkwardly flashing well-attended teeth. A little like the characters from Peter Pan, these children are variously looking for parents either to pay attention to them or work harder at staying together as parents, similar to the four teens of this month's Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, a superior young-person's film blessed with solid acting and believable setups. The Adventures of Shark Boy & Lava Girl in 3-D is even worse because the 3-D is still annoying after all these years to perfect that technology.

Shakespeare in Hamlet described the range of imagination: ""Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till we find it stopping a bung-hole?"" This film could at best hold back the wine."

The acting was the worst acting that I had ever seen! I couldn't believe people were actually watching the movie without rioting at the waste of time and effort they were experiencing! So after a few games of ""lets see how long you can stay in the movie before leaving"" i eventually saw a massive amount of this movie with large regret. Parents coming out of the movie with kids looked amazed that they spent money on it and a few wanted refunds.

Kids won't understand what the point of the speech is if you take them to see this movie. They'll probably like the action and all, but they will think the whole speech thing is a snore. All I'm saying is that maybe we should try not to make that many kid action movies again for a while, because this is a perfect example of getting carried away with the fact that the main characters are supers. Kids, trust me, when you see this movie twenty years from now, you'll hate "

Admittedly, I was interested myself to see the 3-D effects and there was a part of me that hoped it would turn out to be a decent family film even though the trailers certainly made it look terrible...

...and it was terrible.

I can't stand it when I hear the phrase 'but it's a movie about the imagination! Kids will love it!'

Shush your face.

I don't know about you, but even as a kid I would have realized this was a purely stupid movie. There are plenty of imaginative family movies that have been made but this one is completely stupid stupid stupid! The acting is really bad, especially by the annoying whiny lead. Never before can I remember a lead in a kids film that was so unlikeable.

The story could have been alright had it been executed the right way.

The 3-D is neat for awhile and all, but there aren't that many great effects really.

You'd think a director like Rodriguez could make a family film that isn't afraid of being a little less cheesy and perhaps a bit daring... something a bit emotional perhaps even. Wolfgang Peterson and Tim Burton certainly aren't afraid.

I mean, seriously, Spielberg can make Schindler's List and E.T. Can't Rodriguez do Sin City and a family film worth watching as well?

Not that Rodriguez is as great a director as Spielberg.

Blah. Just blah."

It was just a big old boring mish mash. I expected much better from this director. The movie had no mmmph. My kids will enjoy pretty much any movie and they didn't complain about this one.

So, my husband and I drug along our 12 yr old son and trudged to the theater. After the first 5 minutes I knew we in trouble! My husband got a migraine from the poorly done 3-D effects and I ended up with double vision that lasted 30 minutes after the movie. My 12 yr old fell asleep about 15 minutes into the movie, which probably was a blessing for him. That had to be the worst movie I have ever seen. Not just the worst kids movie, the worst movie. When you go to see a film made for children you expect a bit of cheesiness, but this was way over the cheese quota. The acting was horrific, the storyline was lame and the special effects were, well, not so special. Yes, I know his son wrote part of it. My 6 yr old wants to be a director and writes his own ""movie scripts"" from time to time and directs his friends. Some are good, some not so good.

2463,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"The other day I was flipping through channels and I saw that this was on ABC Family. I had nothing else to do and figured that I might as well watch just for the heck of it.

I missed the first half hour, so when I came in Sharkboy and Lavagirl had just retrieved Max from the real world to his dreamworld, Planet Drool, to save it from all of his dreams that had turned into nightmares. Shortly thereafter they meet the evil Mr. Electric, an evil George Lopez robot who's puns (such as ""I'm gonna hit you were it hertz"") are ironically the only parts of the movie that didn't have me laughing, especially since he feels it necessary to take an extra minute to explain them. And just to add to the evil of Lopez's character, he constantly attacks the three daring adventurers with his army of electrical cords. Yeah, it's as bad as it sounds.

However, this movie did make me laugh harder then anything I've seen since Anchorman. Don't believe me? Watch this. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDHye4Vmho. And that's probably Taylor Lautner's best scene.

So, in short, Robert Rodriguez needs to retire and become a plumber, what with this and Spy Kids he's gotta be getting used to crap, and George Lopez needs to fire his agent. At least Taylor Lautner solved all his problems my running around without a shirt on for a couple of hours."
2464,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"I saw this movie in 3-D, and I have to say, I was extremely disappointed. The movie's special effects were terrible, you could tell that everything was CG, they obviously didn't put any effort at all into the animation. The plot was terrible, Sharkboy and Lavagirl's suits looked like they were made out of plastic (which they probably were) and it was overall a very childish film. I mean, really, a banana split boat? Who came up with the idea for this film? A six-year-old?

Despite the horrible quality of the film, I must say that there were some amusing moments in it, I think casting George Lopez was a great idea.

2465,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"Well, well, well. I claim the very dubious honour of having watched this...er...movie twice. Once with a friend and her kids; And again with my 14 year old.

Of course it's a stinker. But then many movies that managed to attain cult status have been worse stinkers than this one ('Attack of the Killer Tomatoes' for example).

One method whereby movies rise to cult level is by negative recommendation. People tell friends how bad it is, and the friends watch it to see why. And I've certainly noticed a whole lot of negative comments regarding this movie. For a long time 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' was regaled as the worse movie made. I and many of my acquaintances watched it just to see why it got that reputation. 'Plan 9' now enjoys a modest cult following.

Another contributing factor is unintentional humour. My second viewing of this movie had me chuckling at Lavagirl's constant Cheshire grins, and at some of the tacked in nonsense to show off the 3d effect (Sharkboy throwing a glass of water toward the audience during his ""dance"" routine, for example).

Sometimes deviating radically from the ""norm"" can project a film into the realm of cult status also. This movie, while not engaging in major deviation, still has enough strangeness about it to give it a little push in that direction.

Who knows. Perhaps in the future, droves of teenagers (and maybe adults too) will throng to theatres late at night, 3d glasses in hand, to see this little piece...as they do now for 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show'.

Right now the future looks grim for this oddity, but I would certainly not be surprised to see it pop up out of nowhere sometime down the road."

A good adventure for kids.The character's terms used in the dialog may be difficult for younger children to understand. The sound was a little too loud, at least in the theater we attended.

2467,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"""The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl in 3D"" was barely advertised. I just happened to see the trailer for it because I worked at Nielsen and got to see the trailer when we were testing it. I also saw the trailer once again in ""Kicking and Screaming"" but other than that, I never saw any advertising for the film. Therefore, I didn't really know what to expect when walking into the theater today to see ""The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl.""

""The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl"" is about a boy named Max (Cayden Boyd) who has a vivid imagination and is a big dreamer. In his dreams, he creates Shark boy (Taylor Lautner) and Lava girl (Taylor Dooley). One day in class, Max tells his class the story of Shark boy and Lava girl, but the class doesn't believe a word of it and just makes fun of him. After class, Max gets in a fight with Linus (Jacob Davich) who takes Max's dream book. You see Max keeps all his dreams written in a book so he always remembers them. When Max, goes home that night he wishes that he doesn't have to return to school but of coarse that doesn't happen. However, the next day something interesting happens, Shark boy and Lava girl show up at school and seek Max's help Max then goes with Shark boy and Lava girl and this is where the fun filled adventure begins.

One thing I can say about Robert Rodriguez is that he has a knack for film-making. He makes movies that are both creative and have unique stories. I actually liked this film better then Spy Kids 3D but not as much as the original Spy Kids or Spy Kids 2. However, in a Robert Rodriguez film once you throw in the 3D element you lose a little story. But this doesn't make the film bad or any less enjoyable. What amazes me about Mr. Rodriguez is how he can make films like ""Sin City"" and ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" and also make great family films such as the ""Spy Kids"" series and this film.

I don't understand why critics hated this movie but then again I don't always understand the critics. When watching a movie like Shark boy and Lava girl, you have to remember one thing that this is a movie made for the enjoyment of little kids. So if you think in that mindset you will really enjoy it. It's extremely creative and unique. It's a movie where your imagination can run wild. If you get into the film, you feel like you're a little kid again and that's a great feeling.

If you go into the theater expecting a cinematic gem you're not going to get it. The acting isn't as good as it was in the ""Spy kids"" movies or any of Robert Rodriguez's other work. The story is decent but won't blow you away. However the film is visually appealing and is fun for people with vivid imaginations. Like I said, go into the movie and take the movie for what it is, a great family popcorn flick that both adults and kids together can enjoy if you put your mind to it.

So in conclusion, If you go into ""The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl"" knowing what to expect you will really enjoy the film. It's like Spy Kids 3D but slightly better because it's more visually interesting and the story is better. I always enjoy Mr. Rodriguez's movies and this one is no different. His directing technique is amazing and he manages to make films for cheap no matter how large the cast or amount of special effects. This movie is a lot of fun and is well worth the trip to the multiplex. It's a great film to bring the kids to and their eyes will be glued to the screen for the entire 95 minutes. I think if you enjoyed the ""Spy Kids"" series then you will probably enjoy this film as well. It's a fun film that is truly underrated.

2478,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"I personally have no real problem with 3D, as long as it is done well and has a good story and characters. Sadly, that's where The Adventures of SharkBoy and Lava Girl fails. I like Robert Rodriguez and thought his first two Spy Kids movies were very enjoyable and while mediocre I actually thought the third Spy Kids film was better than this too. I will give some credit, the moral is decent if hardly original and there is some energy. But everything else falls flat.

People might say the art direction was colourful and pleasing to the eye. Sorry, for me it was very tacky, gaudy and brash. And as for the 3D, it is actually some of the worst I've seen, it needed more clarity and sharpness and sometimes moved too fast. Also I found it distracting in alternative to enhancing. The soundtrack is rather plodding, generic and unmemorable too.

The script is absolutely awful too. Any parts that tried to be funny made me roll my eyes to be perfectly honest with you, while the story is unevenly paced and very weak and predictable. The characters are just as weak and bland too, the two main characters have their likable moments but there is little chemistry between them and the audience while the supporting characters fare even worse suffering either from being underused or overacted. Overall, the acting is very uneven and way too broad in some cases.

Other disappointments are the poor pace and plodding direction from Rodriguez. So in conclusion, the result is a pretty awful, overstuffed and disappointing effort of a family film. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

2480,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"I was excited to watch this. I love fantasy. I love kids films. I loved the first couple Spy Kids films and liked the third. I also love the rest of Robert Rodriguez' work, although I knew that most of it wouldn't be relevant here, of course. And even when The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl began, I loved the first twenty minutes of it or so--up until about the time they arrived at Planet Drool, this was cruising along at about a 9 for me. But then, almost inexplicably, the film falls apart. Rather than a nice, tight, fantastical, almost absurdist film about a couple superheroes, it becomes a random series of events taking place in a computer animated world that looks extremely rushed and unfinished.

I say ""almost inexplicably"" falls apart above because as is well known, director Robert Rodriguez' son, Racer, came up with the story, which was supposedly inspired by his dreams. The material on Planet Drool does have a kind of dream logic to it, which in this case is to say that it basically has no logic to it. There are a few problems with this. Dream logic need not be ""no logic"". There actually is a kind of surrealistic logic that functions during most dreams, and most artistic works that we say have dream logic display this surrealistic logic. One event follows from another in a way that makes some sense; it's just surrealistic sense. Further, the material in the film prior to arriving at Planet Drool has that surrealistic logic rather than just no logic. And the most important point here--dream logic as the absence of logic during the Planet Drool section, which is the bulk of the film, makes it difficult to get into/care about what's happening on the screen. On Planet Drool, one event doesn't follow another logically, even surrealistically; it's all just random.

So it's almost inexplicable, then, because obviously there was a different approach to the first section. Maybe Racer approached it differently, or maybe adults such as Robert edited/revised it in a different way, or maybe the adults tried to edit/revise everything in the same way but just dropped the ball on the Planet Drool stuff. Whatever the reason, when they're on Planet Drool, the rules of the game keep changing, there's no sense of progression or an arc from one event to the next, there's no rhyme or reason to the characters, including the villain, and there's an uncomfortable combination of derivativeness (of everything from The Neverending Story to Wizard of Oz to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to Tron to everything else that Racer has probably watched), groaner corniness (the puns based on heat, fish and dreams/imagination grow more desperate by the minute) and very poorly executed computer animation. The quality of the computer animation is worse than typical early generation PlayStation 1 games. It's not as blocky, but it is as rudimentary and incomplete-looking.

Of course, defenders of the film keep bringing up, ""But it's a kids' film! You're not supposed to like it!"" There are a couple problems with that kind of argument. Whether I'm ""supposed"" to like kids' films or not, I do like the vast majority of them. I've done a good job staying in touch with that side of my nature. It's very rare that I see a kids' film--and I do watch them just as regularly as I watch anything else--that I dislike as much as I disliked The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl. I even love Rolie Polie Olie, and the last couple times (not that long ago) that I checked out Sesame Street and Mister Rogers Neighborhood I enjoyed them--although I know I can't enjoy them in the same way I did as a kid. I could easily see the quality of the material. And certainly this isn't targeted to a younger crowd than any of those titles are. So it's not that I would tend to dislike something just in case it is made to appeal almost exclusively to younger kids, and I doubt that's the case with any other critic worth their weight in movie popcorn.

Secondly, most kids are not totally devoid of any sense of logic. I certainly wasn't when I was a kid, and I didn't have any friends who were either. It's basically hard-wired into our brains. It has to be so we can survive in the world. So I can easily imagine a lot of kids not liking The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl, either, because in the absence of some kind of internal logic and consistency, there's not much to draw them into the story, not like there is in The Wizard of Oz and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The Neverending Story and the Spy Kids Films and Follow that Bird and just about every other kids' film. I agree that very young kids--say, maybe around three of four, may be more prone to liking this film, because it sure is filled with pretty colors and lots of movement. And even slightly older kids won't care about derivativeness (because they won't know) or corniness or anything like that. But you don't have to be very old to tell that there's something missing here that isn't missing in The Wizard of Oz or any of those other films."
2481,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"Sequestered away on his Austin, TX ranch, much like George Lucas on Skywalker Ranch and ILM in the Nicasio Valley of California and Peter Jackson's digital wizards at Weta Digital in New Zealand, Robert Rodriguez has seemingly created for himself a haven to explore not only his own creative juices, but also whatever creative whims seem to be floating through the minds of his children.

Have you ever had a small child tell you a story? It usually goes something like ""And then... blah blah blah... and then... blah blah blah... and then..."" In other words, it rambles ceaselessly with no apparent meaningful beginning or end. This movie is just such an example--and an object lesson that just because you can do something doesn't mean you should, no matter all the nifty gadgetry you have on your ranch.

In short, that is ""Sharkboy and Lava Girl""--coupled with some reigning in by dad who didn't want an otherwise nonsensical story about ""dreams"" or ""the power of dreams"" or ""dreamers"" (or whatever it's about) to wander off too far from a movie's standard three-act set. He squeezed his kid's dreams reluctantly into the movie mold.

""Acted"" by three kids 99% against green screen, the CG is laid on thick and unimaginatively. This is CG for the sake of CG, because it's way cheaper to pay 10 mouse jockeys $50K a year in Texas then it is to build millions of dollars worth of sets.

The movie starts actually with decent potential, but the story and plot meanders after Max arrives on his dreamt ""Planet Drool,"" when the CG is put on like a garish suit. Max ultimately discovers his ""true power"" and becomes a ""day dreamer"" and ferrets out the true identify of his dreamt Shark Boy and Lava Girl. This is all accompanied by a mystical synth. track that reminds us which certain moments are epiphanies.

""Shark Boy"" is a spiky-haired ADD case with WAY too much hair gel and kick-butt karate moves and flips (yes, the ""actor"" is a black belt Karate champ) and ""Lava Girl"" is an uber-cute misfit who is too hot to handle. Lava Girl does a lot of very wide smiles directly into the camera to remind you how cute she is. In other words, there's more ham on the set then there is for Christmas Dinner.

Truly designed for kids who could care less about niggling details like plot, story, structure, and dialog, your wee ones will appreciate the surreal story line and bizarre graphics. My daughter LOVES the movie which may be a clear indication that I've somehow failed to raise her properly."

The movie had several surprises in store for me--- but mostly, I was surprised, shocked, actually, at how god-awful the film quality was. Portions of the movie were regular, with vivid, clear colors and image quality. But most of the movie is in '3-D'. That effect was sooooo awful, it makes me genuinely puzzled as to how this decision could have been made. 3-D might have worked, sort of, but this particular version of it was horrible!

Forgetting the thematic and artsy aspects for a moment--- I would have thought there couldn't be enough cocaine in LA to get people stoned enough to think this looked good. It was a pussy-green, and washed-out gray. The 3-D qualities were so bad that 80% of the time the 3-D was on-screen, the effect simply didn't work.

The movie could have been charming a great fun for the family. Here's hoping the studio execs come to their senses, and re-do this mess in something 'normal', colorful, and watchable."

2486,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"You know how Sharkboy and Lavagirl snuck into Max's house at midnight and ate his mom's cookies? And when they broke into a classroom? I cracked up at those scenes. Wait, it gets funnier, after they find Max and fly off to Planet drool, Max's face expression was funny while the ship flew faster than a hurricane. In the roller coaster scene, it was hilarious when the kids hung upside-down and their faces were like they saw a monster. It was so cool how Sharkboy and Lavagirl can not only jump very high, but they can stand on an upside-down roller coaster. I think this is why people decide to hate this movie, because the 3 adventurers went through a field of brains with a bus. It was nasty, but that doesn't stop me. Sharkboy said that everyone should yell or scream and they did, like little girls.

When Sharkboy fell in chocolate in the Land of Milk and Cookies and then he ate it off his shoe, then he spit it out. Max tried using a marshmallow as a pillow to dream some more and when Lavagirl decided to try it, she burned it. They later got attacked by giants. When the giant tasted the cookie, he spit it out. I loved how Sharkboy and Lavagirl sing a lullaby to Max, then Lavagirl burns Max's ass to wake him up. And Sharkboy's funniest quote was ""Still hungry, Max? How about a knuckle sandwich?!""

When they got to the Land of Ice, I liked how Lavagirl had to sleepwalk to walk over an ice bridge. Then Sharkboy and Max p*ss her off by awakening her and the bridge was falling apart so the bad guy won't chase after them. Lavagirl is funny when she's mad, and when she burned Max's diary, she yelled ""Why did you make me like this?! WHY, Max?!"", then got sprayed by Sharkboy. It also gets funny when it rained brains all over Minus, which also could be why people decide to hate it. And when his brain farted causing his head to become giant, I had a laugh attack.

The scene where Sharkboy and Lavagirl die, it was heart-breaking, but that doesn't stop me from giving this a 10/10. At least Sharkboy came back to life, but he had to throw Lavagirl in a volcano to save her life. Then she later kissed him on the cheek. And it was funny how the Ice Princess froze the main antagonist of this movie and he exploded. The ending was marvelous where Sharkboy and Lavagirl became somewhat boyfriend and girlfriend. And the music of the credits was awesome, whoever wrote the song can sing better than Justin Bieber."
2487,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D"" is a Robert Rodriguez-directed film about a boy who's imagination comes to life and his friends, Sharkboy and Lavagirl, help him try to defeat this evil that is ruling the world that Sharkboy and Lavagirl live in.

This wasn't too bad. I'll certainly say that it's better than the third ""Spy-Kids."" However, the story still lacking a bit. But that's to be expected seeing as it's directed towards kids, not to say that they don't have a clue of what's going on, but it's still directed toward the ones who don't have to think too hard about what's going on. They can just watch a movie that is great entertainment. I sometimes wonder how Rodriguez and his own kid, who did help out with the story, come up with this stuff. It's amazing. Plus, it shows how much Robert Rodriguez loves his son, in that he made this movie for him.

Still, if you have children of your own, see it with them. They'll enjoy"
2488,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"As much as this is an indulgence, it is at least not the man himself, but his offspring and their dreams(as stated in the very opening credits, removing any possible doubt as to that being the case or not). Whether or not such a thing can be made into something amazing, that is not the case here. Few will contest that. But looking further, this does have some merit. By no means the greatest writer, Rodriguez does have both creativity and a well-developed imagination. He lets them roam free in large parts of this, and actually comes up with a clever thing or two, amongst that which isn't. Some of the humor is childish, and certain gags are repeated somewhat ad naseum. Downright cringe-inducing does it become when a character actually follows up his quip, painful enough already, with an explanation of the double meaning. And that even happens more than once. The puns most definitely could have been, well, done without entirely, in an awful lot of cases. Characters are terribly flat and one-note fleshing out never has been Robert's strong suit. Designs aren't half bad. The CGI could be better, if worse has been seen. The action is invariably quite entertaining, the fighting in particular. The acting varies, with a larger portion only reaching ""passable"". Like the first Spy Kids(I haven't watched the others), this has a moral to it, if a relatively naive one, and the content is perfectly acceptable to show even to the youngest family members. Everything is fairly simplified herein. I recommend this to fans of Robert Rodriguez, and/or those fond of comic books, a style captured rather skilfully here. 5/10"

I saw this at the store and I brought it. I wish that I had rented it instead. This was a low-budget movie that does not have brand name actors, the plot revolves around a boy with shark features and a girl with lava powers, and the main idea for this movie came from a 7-year-old kid. The acting was OK, the plot was very basic, the script was not really good, and the score was kind of creepy. Also, the 3D was not the best 3D I have seen. In fact, it is not really realistic. This is not a film you should brag about seeing. I would rather see a movie like Harry Potter or the Lord of the Rings. But hey, this is only my opinion. I rate this a 5"
2491,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"My Take: Despite good intentions, this dizzying 3-D flick is too juvenile for anyone above 10.

For starters, ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"" sounds like a good idea. It shows us what happens and revolves around our dreams. Simply, this idea sounds terrific, and the fact that director Robert Rodriguez's son thought up the story sounds the more interesting. But the final execution, when finally brought to film, is really disappointing. Too much 3-D, and not much story. I guess you know where this is going.

It sounds interesting to see what dreams are made of, but is seriously disappointing when finally brought to the screen, as none other than a parade of effects. Sadly to say, sorry Mr. Robert Rodriguez, but this is not what dreams are, and supposed to be. Hollywood must learn by now that CGI doesn't amount to everything. What starts out nice, once again goes horribly wrong.

Another thing, this movie is a family film alright, but only kids will truly appreciate this one. If scaled, perhaps only 5% of the 100% of the film will be entertaining to the adults.

Overall, leave it to the kids to watch it for themselves. Adults may want to stick to Rodriguez's adult works. Ones that don't ruin a good, fresh story by putting it on murky 3-D.

Rating: ** out of 5."
2492,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"The criticisms of this movie are ridiculous. It is not made for adults. Many of the best kid's movies are also fun for adults, but this is not one of those. The acting is a little stiff, the dialog is silly, and the special effects are uneven. But young kids won't care. The story is about and for kids. My 7 year old boy and 4.5 year old girl really like it. (It would probably be to scary for under 6's to watch without a parent).

I was able to enjoy watching it with my children on a rainy Saturday morning, but mostly because of their joy at the wild visuals and weird environments.

2494,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"This film is not the most awesome ever, I'll admit that but it is not as bad as everyone seem to think it is. In a way I can relate to this story, when I was a kid we used to play around in all kinds of fantasy worlds, where the ultimate coolness was a few lame one-liners and a lot of fighting against weird monsters.

Now this film basically takes me back to that. These aren't the exact stories that I used to dream about but they're damned close and the way they are presented are also very close to 'backinthedays'. The film is played out like a video game, with levels and obstacles to overcome, back in my days these obstacles were all in the 2d or top-down view from Mario or Zelda but I imagine that today they are more in full 3d and with much better graphics. The film had all that.

But as a film. This isn't all that good, it's not the worst ever. And it does have a certain cute playfulness about it, which, I'll assume, would make it good for its target audience. I don't know exactly who the target audience is though, but I suspect they should at least pretty much identify with the protagonist of the film."
2495,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"Robert Rodriguez has managed to duplicate his achievements in Spy Kids 3D: he has written and directed a creative story with excellent special effects but spoilt the process with very poor 3D. The 3D effects themselves are a high standard but the glasses are the old style one-red, one-green eye which don't give a clear image and which reduce almost all of the colour. Lava Girl's hair colour with the glasses off was ideal for the role. However, with the glasses on, which they had to be for the majority of the movie, her hair was almost devoid of colour - very poor effect. Despite the poor 3D colour effects, the movie worked quite well for excitement and action, and is worthwhile see"

2497,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"Well, after seeing this film with my younger sister, the only really word that strikes my mind is ""original"". This movie, although very interesting and original in its own way, reminded me a lot of ""The Never Ending Story"".

I'm not going to go to ""slay"" this movie, fair to say that I didn't enjoy it as much as other Rodrigeuz films. But the reason for that is plain and simple...it-is-a-kids-film. The film's story was thought up by Rodrigeuz's seven year old son, Racer. And in those terms the story is very fitting for children of around that age group. My 10 year old sister loved it! And I'm sure many people here would agree that it was a ""poor"" film, or a ""bland"" film or a ""Rodrigeuz's weakest"" film. But simply, the vast majority of every member on this website is above the age required to enjoy this film! It sparked my sisters imagination, and my cousins. So, from a 16 year olds point of view, I'd give this a 5/10. From a child's point of view, I'll give it a 9/10. I'd seriously recommend this film to children below the age of 13, for it was intended for that age range. However, the 3D ""gimmick"" doesn't really live up to expectation, and it makes the colours of the film very two-tonal (red and green) and I think that the film would be much better if it was just simple 2D. The film is very cheesy, but it's message is received loud and clear and adds a certain ""feel good"" factor to the movie. To adults that factor may be ""thank god its over"", to children, it'll be so much more awe inspiring and imaginative! Your kids will most likely start keeping dream journals and invent characters of a similar calibre to Lavagirl and Sharkboy! A film that re-defines imagination as being something that should be open, outspoken and above all cherished. Something that is becoming increasingly rare with children, due to the steady rise of ""video games"", ""TV shows"" and ""Films"","

There is a ton of 3-d time. There are some middle of the road actors doing a satisfactory job in this flick, the pace is fast enough to hold the kids attention, however it should be said that I actually fell asleep in the theater( granted I was coming off a night shift and had only 3 hrs sleep) But I have never ever fallen asleep in a movie theater. We went to the cheap theater so it only cost $8 for the 4 of us for a matinée- it was our little guys 1st movie( 5yrs) and he didn't like the glasses- but he was excited by the whole experience, as was his 9yr old sister- not the best for parents but your kids will love it -particularly if they liked spy kid"

2502,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"Max is a 10-year-old schoolboy whose life is not going well. His parents' marriage is not a happy one, and he is not popular at school, often being teased by his classmates for his dreamy, imaginative nature. He escapes into an imaginary dream world named Planet Drool (yes, really). The two main inhabitants of this planet are two superhero-type characters, Sharkboy (who was raised by a family of sharks after his marine biologist father disappeared) and Lavagirl, who has the ability to produce fire and lava. The film follows Max's strange adventures when he is mysteriously transported into his dream world, where he meets Sharkboy and Lavagirl and characters who bear a strange resemblance to his teacher Mr. Electricidad, Linus the class bully and Mr Electricidad's daughter Marissa, another classmate.

The film was not popular with the critics, much of the criticism being directed at the allegedly poor 3-D effects and the storyline. It does not seem to be very popular with reviewers on this board either; it is rare that I review a film with a rating as low as 3.5. Well, I myself cannot comment on the 3-D, as I saw it in a 2-D television version. As for the storyline, I felt that too many of the critics were forgetting that this is a children's film and trying to judge it by adult standards.

Certainly, judged by the logic of the everyday, rational world the story does not make a great deal of sense. But that is not the logic by which the film should be judged. Its logic is that of ""Alice in Wonderland"" or ""The Wizard of Oz"", that is to say the logic of the dream. As Lavagirl says ""Everything that is or ever was began with a dream"". Much of the story was, in fact, thought up by the children of the writer-director Robert Rodriguez. This is, however, an ""Alice in Wonderland"" updated for the computer age of the 21st century. Mr Electricidad's alter ego on Planet Drool is the planet's electrician Mr. Electric, and much of the film's imagery is drawn from the world of technology, such as a robot or ""plughounds"", dog-like creatures made out of electrical cables. There are, however, more conventional fairy-tale elements, such as the Ice Princess (based on Marissa), who possesses a Crystal Heart which can freeze time.

Trying to judge a film like this one is difficult for me, because I have no children of my own. I have to try and think myself back into my own childhood and ask ""Would I have enjoyed a film like this in those days?"" And the answer is ""Yes, I would"", even though ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"" is very different to anything that was actually about in the sixties and seventies when I was young. Yes, the story may be eccentric, even at time silly. But that is just what many kids like. 7/10"

They might have aged a bit throughout the years, but I can still manage to enjoy it. However, instead of seeing this as the director of those 2 classics, I see him as the director of Spy Kids 3 and 4.

Why?

Because it was filled with obnoxious 3-D, terrible acting, and CG-i that I can only describe as something Foodfight would show in their movie...just without the sexual innuendos and fetishes.

But I just can't really hate it. Besides, much of the ideas in the movie was from the director's son Racer. Plus, it was laughably bad.

Or whether it is simply a made up superhero world dreamt by a young boy. This film enlightens the younger generation to widen their imaginations and create TV's next superheroes. While the film itself is inspirational to the younger generation and where their mind will take them, the graphics and quality of the film are low, even for 2005's standards.

First of all, being an American in Germany, we cannot just go to Wal Mart and purchase any movie we want at any time. Not all internet sites will ship to us. So we rent it, which we are fortunate enough that a local store has at least two copies. That said, we have rented it so many times that we recognize the individual disks that we get from the store.

To say that this movie is my kids favorite movie of all time would be a great understatement. The kids will play ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"" on their own in the backyard or at the park or wherever they happen to be at the time. They fight over who gets to be Sharkboy and who gets to be Lavagirl and who is Max and who is the Ice Princess. (I'm usually Mr. Electric.)

It's also interesting to note that it is the first serious role played by Taylor Lautner, who many fans will recognize as a particularly popular werewolf in another movie."

I am the sort who could like all three features of Spy Kids. When the story of this one moved into dream-world I could easily accept the animation. I could accept that this not up to the level of high tech animation and do not consider that to always be such a bad thing. The only problem that I experienced with this was the story flow and the content of the flow and I do experience that as a big problem.

2513,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D was probably better to be seen in the theater rather than on the small screen. It also helps to be not over the age of 9.

Still bearing that in mind and trying to view the film with a child's eye it's a charming story about a young kid whose make believe fantasy superhero friends come to life and take him to where one of them is from.

How'd you like to live on planet drool, as if some us might not live there already. That's where Lavagirl is from and the planet is in danger where kids are being held captive on an eternally moving roller-coaster. When one is on such a machine one hasn't the time to think or even daydream and in this world imagination is the enemy of the ruler, George Lopez who in a Wizard of Oz like turn is also the 3rd grade teacher in real life.

Cayden Boyd is the day dreaming Max who even keeps a journal of the adventures of his two friends. Taylor Lautner and Taylor Dooley are Sharkboy and Lavagirl, Lautner has certainly grown up and out in the past five years and now has some considerable box office pull with the Twilight films. David Arquette and Kristin Davis are Boyd's bickering parents who don't quite seem to have the time for their kid any longer.

Sharkboy and Lavagirl is a nice family film for those who have an eye for fantasy of The Wizard Of Oz kind."

Save this one for a rainy day rental, for kids around 6 and up who are completely bored out of their mind.

2520,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"I thought this movie was great for kids. My two girls loved it. They were more interested in the characters of Shark Boy and Lava Girl than the actual plot, but they loved it. Its great to see such young actors do such a superb job in their first motion picture.. Taylor Dooley as Lava Girl and Taylor Lautner as Shark Boy will definitely be the next big thing in Hollywood. Two thumbs up for any kid to go see this movie.

No matter what the critics say... As a mother I thought it was a great movie... I think there should be more action adventures for young kids to get into.... I would definitely go see any movie Robert Rodriguez does, whether its his sons ideas or his. He obviously can take any idea and run with it. So take your kids to see this movie, watching their faces light up as they take a trip through the land of milk and cookies will be well worth it.."
2521,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"The audience intended for ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D"" is for kids to about age 11...at the most. So, having another review by an adult saying they hated the film isn't anything unusual or even totally necessary. The important thing is will kids enjoy this film that has managed to land on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list? I don't know....and assume for many of them the answer is no...though I am not sure.

So why did I watch the movie? After all, I am not a kid and the film, by many standards, is terrible. It's because I have a weird hobby...watching as many films as I can from the Bottom 100 list. Some of the pictures aren't that bad...some are unintentionally funny...some are just terrible....it's quite the adventure seeing which is the case for each film.

When I first started watching the movie, I was taken aback by the CGI. While it's one of the earliest CGI-intensive live-action films, compared to similar pictures (such as ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow""), it is hideous. Much of it is due to the color palate...and the colors heavily lean towards neon green, neon purple and neon pink. It's an assault on the eyes and my eyes kept threatening to either bleed or run away and leave me!! For adults, this alone make the film horrid...though kids often love garish colors (as seen in such movies as ""The Oogieloves"" and TV shows like ""Teletubbies"").

The story is about a loner, Max, and his two new friends, Sharkboy and Lavagirl, and their attempt to save the world. The friends have obvious super-powers...so why do they need Max? Well, down deep he does have powers...the power of dreams (yick!). And, together they attempt to rid the world of its worst menace....George Lopez.

I hated the film. The writing was sloppy, filled with cliches and the characters seemed like caricatures. To say the movie was like a bigger budgeted bad Nickelodeon live-action show is pretty much on target. But, and I must repeat, it was never intended to please adults....though making it this tough to enjoy hurt marketing because parents (at least sane ones) don't send little kids to the theaters alone....and imagining any parent sitting though this is pretty tough! In additon to the terrible writing and CGI, special attention should be given to George Lopez and his rotten and one-dimensional acting. You can't blame the kids for being bad and in a bad film...but Lopez should have known better. I wonder if he could look at himself in the mirror after making this mess. I hope not.

Finally, I would love to know how this film cost $50,000,000 to make. After all, the CGI isn't good and was apparently rushed. Perhaps the bulk of the money went to Robert Rodriguez. After all, he has something like a dozen credits in this movie...writing, directing, acting and much more. Regardless, it seems like for the money, it should have been much better."
2522,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"This uses color and glitz in place of story, character development, and heart, and falls flat on its face in the process.

There is a story here, but it's lost among the detritus of cheesy effects, bad CGI, and some pretty bad Spam performances by three underage over-actors. If THIS is what Robert Rodriguez had in mind, I mean...if he did this on PURPOSE, I fear for Sin City 2 & 3, as he is producing, writing, and directing those, as well.

But back to this trash.

The characters have been poorly recreated, the setting is a planet, rather than a realm, and there is no Queen. The Nothing is replaced by the Darkness, and Atreyu/Bastian is now Max, whose adventure means nothing in the greater scheme of things, in place of the great quest of honor in search of truth, nobility, and self of Atreyu's tale.

Also, some of this, like the Land of Milk and Cookies, felt more like Wonka's Chocolate Factory...or rather, a horrible disgusting CGI mess of it.

Did I mention that this absolutely stinks? It rates nothing for effects, nothing for story, nothing for acting, nothing for direction, nothing for concept.

I guess that means it's a 0.0/10 from...

2524,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"Robert Rodriguez has been rapidly releasing films since his low-budget miracle El Mariachi debuted thirteen years ago. That film reportedly cost a mere $7000 to shoot, but it instantly became its creator's meal ticket. Despite his obvious talent behind the camera and impressive work ethic, Rodriguez had never delivered another unique picture until this year's Sin City. Sadly, he has followed up that groundbreaking effort with a sappy 3-D nightmare based on a short story written by his 7-year old son.

It would have been better for audiences everywhere if Rodriguez had simply taken his son's story and posted it on the family refrigerator. Instead, he has taken advantage of his current good standing in Hollywood and manufactured one of the worst films in recent memory. The story, paper-thin as it is, revolves around 10 year-old Max and the title characters that exist in his dreams. If you have seen The Neverending Story, you've witnessed a far superior interpretation of this film's familiar themes.

The 3-D portions of the movie, which constitute most of its 92 minute running time, are shoddy and rarely engaging. It's ironic that a 3-D feature should be populated by such one-dimensional characters. The abundance of painfully corny humor is made worse by the unskilled actors who deliver it. Equally annoying is Rodriguez's inexplicable need to repeat the themes of the film in nearly every line of dialogue. Viewers of all ages are advised to stay away from this patronizing headache of a movie.

Rating: D-"
2525,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"I thought this was an excellent children's film, hearkening back to the days of The Phantom Tollbooth, The Pagemaster, Labyrinth, The Dark Crystal, and Neverending Story. It combines entertaining action with real moral lessons (that are not preachy or political): you can only make your dreams a reality if you work hard to make them true; those who have had their dreams smashed will seek to smash others' dreams; you cannot escape fear because it exists in your mind; do not dream selfish dreams when the world needs you to make it a better place; and unfinished, unrealized dreams will die inside your mind. Certainly, the characters were somewhat flat, but name a children's film in which they are not. At least this film is smart and fun. It mostly takes place literally in the main character's dream world, a dark 3-D universe where things are changing and he must strive to set things right. The combination of self-sacrifice, maturity, and valiance saves the day and even characters in the real world learn important less"
2526,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"The Matrix meets Spy Kids when 10 year-old Max (Cayden Boyd) blurs the lines between the dream world and the real world in The Adventures of Sharkboy & Lavagirl in 3-D. Did Max simply dream up Sharkboy and Lavagirl in some psychosomatic response to his parents' failing marriage? Or did he really go to Planet Drool to fight the evil Mr. Electricity (George Lopez)? Though his 7 year-old son, Racer Rodriguez, technically came up with the story and characters in the film, Sharkboy & Lavagirl is clearly a metaphor for writer/director Robert Rodriguez and his philosophy on life. This is a movie about dreams, passions, and working hard to make your dreams a reality. There is no bigger dreamer in the entire film industry than Mr. Rodriguez, and no one works harder and gets less sleep (he shot this film and Sin City at the same time). But he makes his dreams into realities, time and time again (he works at ""the speed of thought,"" to use his favorite expression). And his dreams also tend to make Miramax and other studios a lot of money, too. But I digress.

Very few movies, even traditional ""kid movies,"" honor kids and their ideas like Sharkboy & Lavagirl does. The heroes of this film are the characters with the biggest dreams and wildest imaginations, while the bad guys are those intent on crushing dreams. Kids are so often belittled in film, depicted as troublemakers or whiny brats. This movie, on the other hand, shows how much Rodriguez loves and honors his kids, and respects the imagination of all children.

Besides the great message of this movie, it's also a blast to watch! I have to admit, this was my first 3-D movie, and I was blown away. I literally reached up and tried to grab bubbles. Why don't more people make 3-D movies? They're so much fun! The Adventures of Sharkboy & Lavagirl in 3-D was made by kids and for kids, and kids everywhere are going to love it. And the parents, siblings, and babysitters who have to take them to the theater are going to love it, too."

That alone was worth the price of the tickets. The way they were interacting with the 3-D was a riot. When we returned home, my kids kept pretending to be the characters in the movie.

It's bright and obnoxious, constantly being in your face, even when viewed in 2-D. The effects are some of the worst around, and because the film fails to draw us into its imagination, they really do stand out. The performances are mostly embarrassing.

I liked it.

Yep: I thought it was good. I thought it was better than most contemporary children's movies. Why? 1) Sharkboy and Lavagirl have depth. No, seriously, as superheroes go, they take the angst of the Spiderman movies and adapt it well for a younger crowd.

2) It's theme of imagination makes a perfect fall-back. So it seems the movie goes in a stupid direction, huh? Unfortunately I remember my childlike imagination going in that direction as well when I was that age. In fact, almost all of the stuff shown, right down to the ending, fit perfectly the type of random stuff I'd come up with when I was a kid. I related to it perfectly, and I'm usually the type of person who gets angry when a movie doesn't match the type of daydreaming imagination I had when I was little and spent all of my time walking around and around the playground, thinking of random child superheroes to have adventures with.

3) At first the virtual reality world is, of course, too cartoony for real-world characters. However, what ends up amazing is how well they interact in such a fake world. It's seamless, and after a while I forgot how fake it was. Much more beloved and much more highly rated films have CGI/special effects worlds that it doesn't even look like the characters are moving in. This one has them walking along in them as if they're really there.

4) Rodriguez may not make the most artistic or original movies, but he knows what he's doing when streaming together a line of images. Invisible editing and conscientious directing kept the story flowing pretty much as smoothly as the milk in the cookie land. It was nice to see.

5) I didn't get to watch it in 3-D, but it felt like it was in 3-D anyways. GREAT cinematography.

So yeah. Good movie. Better than Spy Kids.

What probably sets people off are the ending scenes (barely, BARELY worked) and the first few scenes with Sharkboy and Lavagirl. They're very discombobulating and the acting isn't exactly the best. Finally, Linus/Minus isn't the best child actor I've ever seen, and his character wasn't as developed as it could have been. These are the reasons people have a hard time getting caught in the rest of the movie.

I can't make other people like it, but I sure do.

He wants to be Shark Boy now.

We winced in places, this not being our cup of tea, but hey, it's for the kids (and partially BY the kids, in this instance!). While it's nice when we're vastly entertained, too (they can't all be TOY STORY or SPIDERMAN), we found this one better than YUGIOH the movie, during which we whispered fervent commands to one another to ""Make it stop"" and considered having emergency tranquilizer darts in our possession for next time, just in case.

I understand that this is supposed to be a ""power of imagination"" kids story, but there is just a lot of garbage in this.

The kids seem to do some fairly good acting for what they're asked to do, but I'm not sure why George Lopez was cast, but the writing is weak enough that it could easily just be the writing.

The story is designed to look like it's just literally written haphazardly as they go, so it's hard to tell what's badly written, and what's correctly written to make it look like bad kid writing.

While the characters of Sharkboy (especially) and Lavagirl are quite ridiculous, there are some fun things that they include throughout the movie, so its not like the movie is completely without quality, but piled together it was not an experience I'd want to do again."
2544,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"A pretty fun and cool children's film but anyone young adult and above will probably struggle. From the mind of Robert's son Racer (such a cool name!), a young boy named Max (Cayden Boyd) lives mostly in his imagination and when two of his characters, Sharkboy (debut film for Taylor Lautner) and Lavagirl (Taylor Dooley) come to life, he joins them in an epic adventure to save the world. I think it's a genuinely lovely idea and a great story behind the scenes with Rodriguez and his son teaming together to make a big screen outing for his dreams (there's even a commentary on the dvd from them both which is awesome!). I do also think people have been really unfair in their criticism of the film. Unfortunately though it doesn't quite hang together fully as a film and patience will be tested the older you are. There are some fun performances particularly from George Lopez as the evil Mr. Electric who made me giggle on quite a few occasions. I understand how the visuals may faze some but I found its cartoonish vibrancy quite cool! Overall, fairly unmemorable but a good one to have on for the kids and a sweet experiment for the Rodriguez family"
2545,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"This is a kids movie, better for pre-teens, all about defending your dreams and imagination, and bringing them to play in the real world. That sounds like a pretty cool theme but the disjointed plot and the weak writing undermine it terribly. The characters are cartoonish - not just Lavagirl and Sharkboy but the 'realworld' characters too. When I read that Rodriguez's 7-year old was given a writing credit it made sense - it comes over as written by a 7-year old, its just embarrassing that it was also written by his Dad.

Bet it was the seven year old that included a girl as a main character that wasn't a love interest, though. Rodriguez accidentally let that through, but made sure it doesn't pass the bechdel test.

Still, once you accept you are watching a cartoon - don't expect anything much beyond comic-book characters - and run with it, it is quite fun. My kids delight certainly helped me enjoy this, but I gave myself up to the daftness. The 2D visuals were bright though basic and no more was needed. I'm slightly embarrassed to say it, but watching this with my kids I did enjoy this movie."

The story is creative, positive without being overbearing, the story is extremely imaginative and moves quickly. Acting by the kids involved is not bad at all compared to some I've seen, in fact it's generally quite good.

My 7-year-old son is not easy to hook into watching anything like this but he happened to wander into the room while it was on the TV and in a few minutes he was sitting on the floor, transfixed by the story and the special effects - which were appropriate to the story but not overdone for their own sake.

I don't think this is such a bad movie at all, for kids of course but there's so much worse out there. This one didn't have any double entendres or anything even slightly inappropriate or questionable... you can have your children of any age watch this without any problems at all."

It is hard to get angry about the chocolate-milk induced ravings of an eight-year-old boy - Rodriguez's own son was responsible for the creation and development of the titular heroes - or even the fact that his father decided to use his skills to bring them to life, considering that this is much more a bonding exercise for one man's family than something to be shared with the world. To be honest, it is competently constructed (in a very nuts and bolts kind of way) with a few semi-decent messages in there for the youngest of the crowd, but that's not to imply that this is anything other than a dreadfully dull, wholly nonsensical, wildly inconsistent, criminally ugly, jarringly intangible, hammily acted mess that was clearly written by a child with a crayon.

I enjoy the movie. I love their adventures. I love the components of Planet Drool. I love the creativity invested in the villains and challenges. But this is a fantasy movie that suppose to convince you that the fictional world is real. Planet Drool looks like a video game background, and it should like alive.

2555,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"Let me get the story out of the way first. The film is about a boy (Max) who is picked on at school and decides to conjure up his perfect dream world to escape the real world. His world in on the Planet Drool and the superheroes that protect it are Sharkboy (Taylor Lautner) and Lavagirl (Taylor Dooley). When trouble occurs on the planet Drool, the 2 heroes materialize on Earth. They seek out the only person who can save the planet, which is Max. From there the wild adventure begins.

Now, if you have seen the awful SpyKids 3-D, then you have some idea as to how this movie will look. I didn't care for either movie. The story was just badly written and definitely didn't have anything interesting in it to keep adults attention. Whereas movies like Toy Story 3 and Up have enough entertainment to keep both kids and adults glued to their seats, AoS&L will make you want to run out of the theater. There are some nice special effects and some funny moments, but not enough to keep you there for 93mins. I do get what Robert R was trying to do and he does it right if only 4-12yrs old are going to see his film.

Kids 4-12yrs old will probably love this film. It's aim squarely at them just like the movie ""Shorts"". If you were going to the movies, you'd send your kids in to see this and then you would go and see Robert's Grindhouse (Planet Terror) or Machete flicks instead. I do enjoy most of Robert R. movies. I was a big fan of Grindhouse (Planet Terror), Sin City, El Mariachi, Desperado, Spy Kids 1 & 2, From Dusk Till Dawm and even The Faculty. Movies like Shorts and AoS&L just can't keep my interest. They are just too kiddie for me. I'm hoping Robert and Quentin will give us another Grindhouse film, but have it focused on Horror or Japanese Giant Monsters like Godzilla. I would be interested to see how then would make movies in those genres.

If you are an adult or teen older then 12, don't even waste your time on this flick. Not worth a rent or purchase. If you have kids who are 4-12yrs old, pick up all the Pixar and Disney flicks you can find. That will keep them entertained for a few months.

Score 4 our of 10."
2556,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"I saw this film with a friend on Saturday and we both really enjoyed it. This movie is very imaginative. This movie can also be funny at times. It deals with real life situations like divorce and being bullied.

The 3-D doesn't give you a headache like Spy Kids 3-D did, which is great. The 3-D in this movie is really fun. I didn't see one thing that wasn't decent.

Remember this movie was made for the kids. Not the critic, not the adults, but the kids. I recommend this movie to families with kids and i also recommend this movie to adults that feel they are aging to fast and wanna feel like a kid again. So, please go see this movie, you will be surprised. 10"

I took my daughter and several other kids to see it and they all enjoyed it and cheered and laughed through the entire movie. The movie had some good morales which is very much lacking today in just about every movie. And just as an added plus I enjoyed the movie as well.

I see nothing wrong with knowing who your audience is. There are too many supposedly kids movies that have no concept who their audience is and do nothing more than bore the kids and offend the parents. Movies for kids do not have to be filled with disgusting humor and fart jokes to be entertaining. I hope to see more movies like this one for children.

2560,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"The Adventures of Sharkboy And Lavagirl sums up many of the problem with children's entertainment these days that isn't made by Pixar or DreamWorks. It's stupid, insipid, insulting, painful, and every other hateful term you could come up with. Why is it so bad? Here's why.

Firstly, the story. While the initial premise may not sound too bad(I'm not gonna describe it since this is IMDb so you could easily find it), the execution is what makes it so horrible.

Firstly, the dialogue is laughable. I know these are supposed to be Grade 4 kids but good God, the dialogue here is so fwcking stupid! It's hard to describe so I'm just gonna put down a few examples, Linus(the bully): ""I'm gonna burst your bubble, dream boy!"", Mr. Electric(the villain): ""This is gonna hertz! Get it, hertz? As in electrical frequency?"", (Lavagirl walks by and burns some paper), Linus: ""She's hot!"", and the worst one of them all, Max(our protagonist): ""I wish I could just escape this loser(emphasis here) world and go to Planet Drool!"". Great dialogue, huh? Quentin Tarantino, eat your heart out!

But if the dialogue wasn't bad enough, the kids'acting is... HORRIBLE! They don't even look like they know what they are doing half the time and it wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that the script requires them to do DRAMA! Every time one of them got mad, every time one of them broke down and cried, I never bought it. It actually feels like I'm watching a school play at times. The adults on the other hand, are OKAY in their parts with George Lopez seeming to have fun with his part as Mr. Electric but boy, is David Arquette bad in this! There's a scene where his wife is about to be sucked away by a tornado and he sounds like he's mocking the script! I literally bursted out laughing at that scene when I was supposed to be touched by his change of heart! And it's strange because from what I've seen of David Arquette in the Scream films, he's not a bad actor. He's no Brando but he can do comedy and he's good at playing shy and awkward. So I don't know why is he this bad in this film.

Now since this is a superhero movie(sorta), you'd expect great technicals, right? WRONG! The special effects in this film are easily some of the worst special effects of the 2000's. Well, at least theatrically. Just oh my God, is the CGI bad! This movie was shot on a soundstage with nothing but a greenscreen 70% of the time, which isn't something I'm fond of even if it's done by some of the best CGI artists working today but it wouldn't bother me that much if the script and acting was good but here, it isn't so it just makes it worse! I never for a second, believed that these actors were actually IN the world that the script put them in because of how overly digital everything looked. They also try to throw as much junk as they could in front of the camera since this movie was released in 3D and it's just stupid. You don't need to throw that much crap into the camera just because it's 3D.

The comedy in the film is so freaking juvenile! All it is is stupid jokes related to butts, farts, and poop! Now I know this is a kids'movie but come on, you could try harder than that.

So yeah, this movie is pretty freaking terrible. The acting is poor, the dialogue sounds like it's written by a fifth-grader, the effects are incredibly cheap, and the comedy is just plain juvenile. Seriously, don't show your kids this, show them something from Pixar or DreamWorks instead. Those films are much funnier, much better made, much better written, and most of all, doesn't insult the intelligence of children."

Maybe 5-year-olds liked it, but older than that and you see what it really is.

The part that bugged me most was not the terrible plot (holier than a Mafia target), the ""kids are oppressed"" vibe, or even the dialog (no adjectives can describe it). What I hated beyond all else was the way they cleaned it up to the extreme. For instance, in a crisis, a man says to his wife, not ""I love you,"" but ""You're my best friend."" That should give you an idea of what we're dealing with here. Every 5-year -old has seen love in every other movie they've ever seen.

Better than War of the Worlds. (Tim Robbins ""hamed"" it up completely.)... Why is this film so intensely Hated or Loved and so widely commented on?.(80 odd comments on this IMDb site alone, so far) Because it is SO good!. It is So, So good. It will be seen as an all time Cult classic. Without doubt.

One of those films initially with mixed reviews that later on become an all time great. That is when people understand it more fully. I went to see it twice, thoroughly enjoying the film from start to finish. Within two minutes of the film I was totally captivated by it, it had regressed me back to an age of happier times. 40 years of guilt, inhibitions and hardheartedness just vanished away, leaving the, ""Child within us"" as we are so widely reported to having, once more alive and kicking. A rebirth of sorts,

If I could watch this film every weekend at the movies, I would do so. Were I a lottery ticket winner I would buy a single screen cinema and consistently show this film in my town. That is how good this film is. One of my all time top 10 films. I can feel it!. Just, ""Let go"" and you might to."

Fun 3D family movie with inventive 3D dream sequences. This is probably the best 3D movie I've watched where the 3D and non-3D blend together so well. Rodriguez does a great job of introducing the characters and keeping the story going despite similarities to Wolfgang Peterson's ""Never Ending Story."" The premise revolves around a family that is falling apart because the parents aren't getting along and the child is caught between real life and a dream world and very often chooses the dream world because things work out the way he wants them to as opposed to real life, where everything goes wrong. Slowly the dream world of Shark Boy and Lava Girl blends with the real world and eventually things work out for everyone. Along the way, there are inventive villains, sets, and basically just a good old fashioned fun time at the movie's. Rodriguez sure knows how to hit the chord on the family movie and connects with the adult audience as well. Keep it going Robert, you are definitely a great alternative to Disney these days."

2578,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"Age six to ten audiences usually get the short end of the stick when it comes to major feature films. Although technically films like ""Elf"" and ""Toy Story"" target this demographic, the marketing people insist that these productions incorporate adult elements and humor to expand the target audience and maximize attendance; these are called ""family films"" and the additional elements take much away from the identification experience that children most enjoy. The only escape from these multi-generational things are preschool stuff like ""Clifford's Really Big Movie"" and ""Muppets from Space"" which no one in the 6-10 group would admit to watching, let alone liking.

Then along comes Robert Rodriguez with ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"", a film that gives 6-10 audiences exactly what they want without even the slightest attempt to appeal to older viewers (well maybe middle schoolers will get crushes on Sharkboy and Lavagirl). Since this is a new animal to most critics, it gets blasted for not being what they wanted it to be, a family film. And teenagers complain that it is not as good as ""Spy Kids"", a Rodriguez film that not only targeted a broader audience but which most of them watched several years ago when they were preteens. To be fair, while Rodriguez did not make ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"" for 14 year olds who saw ""Spy Kids"" 4-5 years ago, the distributors did attempt to market it to those audiences-who are now angry about being misled although I think the trailer gives a pretty accurate representation of the film.

So don't let the negative reviews and comments discourage anyone in the target audience from seeing this film. There are plenty of positive reviews and comments from critics who have a clue about Rodriguez's intentions and from the viewers in his target audience. There will be a lot of Sharkboys and Lavagirls out trick or treating this year and the film will become a classic to those who first see it at a young age.

Which is not to say that only those in its target audience will enjoy the film, it is a fun children's tale that might be described as a cross between ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Yellow Submarine"". But for most adults and almost all teenagers, the only really entertaining part will be watching the pre-teens (both girls and boys) totally getting off on the whole thing.

In one respect it is better because almost all the actors are kids; Rodriguez understands that a lot of adult characters in a children's film is a less than zero situation. And it has very good messages: emphasizing the value of dreams, how dreaming better (i.e. unselfishly) increases that value, and how working to make you dreams come true maximizes that value (the young hero's name is ""Max""). Plus Sharkboy and Lavagirl are best friends who demonstrate a willingness to risk their lives to save each other.

Speaking of less than zero, the advantage of seeing this on DVD versus in a theater is having the option to watch in 2-D. The 3-D version subtracts instead of adding, as much of the brightness and life of the film are lost to the crude 3-D cardboard glasses process they used. The only useful thing about the 3-D (other than a mildly interesting visual effect for those who have never experienced it) is the interactive aspect; as signs flash on the screen telling when to put on and take off the polarizing glasses. The DVD contains both versions and the 2-D one is first rate."

2587,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl is a poor 3D film made for kids and by an actual kid. Supposedly, Robert Rodriguez's seven year old son, Racer assisted Rodriguez in writing the screenplay for this film, but that doesn't mean I'll treat like anything less than a movie. Just because a seven year old probably wrote more than half of it, it's still a movie in a wide release. I have full right to nitpick it. While I will say Racer has creative and inventive daydreams, I don't think a movie was entirely necessary; especially in the tiresome, droning 3D.

The 3D dates back to when RealD was never out. The Red/Blue glasses ruled mostly from 2003 - 05. I remember Spy Kids 3D: Game Over and this film being the prime examples and topics for best 3D movie in my school. I disagreed with both films. Both movies' 3D value really sucks. It completely tones down the color scheme and even in 2D the film still has the ""Glasses On"" thing informing you the upcoming scene will be in 3D. It should read ""Colors commencing off in five...four...three...two...one...off.

So the movie's plot is dam sure a seven year olds dream. It reminds me of when some of the classic stories like Alice in Wonderland were written when the author was on drugs. I could almost drag out my bong and make something like this. Max is a loner at school. He's bullied by everyone, but there's much more than meets the eye about him. He carries around ""a dream journal"" in which he writes down his thoughts and ideas as they stem from his creative head.

We then go into the world of Sharkboy and Lavagirl who magically appear during a tornado when Max is at school. They take him to ""Planet Drool"" where dreams rule (no pun). The goal is to stop ""Planet Drool"" from being taken over by Mr. Electric. So the whole movie is the protagonists trying every which way and going through every obstacle trying to achieve what one would assume be an easy goal.

It's another kids film so don't expect much of the plot. The visuals are nice...if the 3D wasn't added. The biggest gripe of the film stems from the 3D as stated before. I dug out the DVD of it and watched it that way and my memories of my assumption of my vision being shot when I watched it all came back. I repeatedly ask my mom if my eyes weren't working because everything looked drab and lifeless. This is the kind of film that has a lot of vibrant visuals and some great shots of water and lava. Don't use 3D which tones down the brightness.

The Adventures of Sharkboy & Lavagirl is a failed experiment of a movie. It's an unnecessary, predictable film ruined by it's lackluster 3D scheme. While all three kids are fun loving, adventurous, and likable protagonists and the moral of the story is a good one, I think kids will be too busy taking off their glasses, asking lots of questions, and wondering why the colors look like colored Easter Eggs that were put in the dye for thirty seconds to hear what the moral was.

Sure it's no Brokeback Mountain, but that's not what I was expecting. I was expecting a fun, engaging movie along the lines of Spy Kids for my two kids (5 and 7) and I got exactly what I hoped for. So nice to have both male and female protagonists! The humour was juvenile and very appropriate; my children were screaming with laughter at some points.

Then, think about how *cool* it would be if you had been raised by sharks, and had gills and fins and razor-sharp teeth, and your best friend was a girl made of lava, and you both had all these cool powers.

2593,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2005),3.6,Robert Rodriguez,"IT seems that when it comes to family, Robert Rodriguez is the ultimate dad. Wouldn't it be great if your father turned round to you and say...hey, why not make a movie together? That's the way Sharkboy was made-by a six year old kid and his dad. The story is of young Max, a dizzy daydreamer who is bullied because of his 'WILD' imagination. He magics up two superhero's, Sharkboy and Lavagirl, who happen to be real...sort of. Well, now Max's enemies better hide in shame, as his creations blast through the walls of school to take us all to Planet Drool, the hype world which the hothead and the coldfish so happen to live on. Confused? you will be in the muddy 3-D effects that follow. Turns out that Max is needed to dream the planet back to life...

But he has forgot his dream journal!!! Oh no! Like I said, the effects don't work in 3-D and the world of Planet Drool is totally over-the top. Fans of Spy Kids and Robert Rodriguez and kids won't be too disappointed, but those over 14 and really unhappy children won't see eye to eye with the CGI. The cast is relied on three young amaetures (Lautner and Dooley as Sharkboy and Lavagirl and Boyd as Max) however, it is the young cast, and not Latino God George Lopez who carry the story. That is why it has got a higher mark- For its younger casts enthusiasm. The adults are easily out-acted by the young sprogs. Lopez can'y be bothered, Kristin Davies plays the bored mom and David Arquette (the movies most famous star) shows up on screen with boring quotes for just twenty seconds. In fact, the movie has no real stars. just amaetures willing to boost their young careers. Oh well, Drew Barrymore wannabe all round.

So we know that this movie is appealing to at least one person, the director's son, but that doesn't make it that great for the rest of us. There's not a whole lot to the story, but it has a couple things going for it: For one, I thought the George Lopez role was OK, he had a good line at the end about how a good teacher learns from his students. Also, Sharkboy and Lava Girl have a sort of neat symbiotic relationship with their superpowers. Mostly, the film is about the 3-D gimmick, though, which is quite an experience at times, and enhances a few of the action's more spine-tingling moments.

2600,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"In this 4th and final Chritopher Reeve Superman film, Superman tries to rid the world of nuclear weapons, only to find that Lex Luthor is back and ready to supply the world with these dangerous weapons. Oh, and he has a new sidekick: Nuclear Man!

Many people have given this a lower rating (understandably), but a 3 or 4 out of 10? It really is not that bad. The film is fun, fast-paced and very watchable. Some consider it the worst, but I did not find it any better or worse than part 3. Granted, parts 1 and 2 are superior (thanks Richard Donner) but I've seen many worse films than Superman 4.

Random thoughts: The double date scene was clever, but really annoying and completely pointless. If Superman would just reveal himself to Lois Lane he wouldn't have to find other girls on the side... although see below.

The idea of getting rid of nuclear weapons was very nice and a great social and political commentary. I agree getting rid of nuclear weapons would be a good move. But the film made this very unrealistic. The world cheers him on, when in reality the countries would protest. He invades a variety of countries and steals their to secret hidden weapons (not sure on the legality or logistics of that). And what is to stop someone from building these weapons all over again?

What happened to Lana Lang? At the end of part 3, it looked like Superman finally realized that Lois Lane is a loser and hooked up with Lana. But she is never seen or mentioned in part 4, despite working for the Daily Planet (at least as of the last film). What gives?

Does anyone else think Lex Luthor is getting a little tired? Did we really need 3 films with Luthor and one with a Luthor knockoff? What about Brainiac or Bizarro or the Eradicator or just about anyone else? Heck, General Zod is so much cooler than Luthor (with all due respect to Gene Hackman).

There's a scene where he rebuilds the great wall of China just by looking at it. What power did he use? Tractor beams from his nipples?

But anyway, this film is not as bad as many would have you believe, and if you've spent six hours on the first three, you might as well invest 90 more minutes in this series finale."
2601,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Superman Turns ""Peacenik"" could be another title to this film. Christopher Reeve remarked several times that this was his most ""important"" Superman movie. Being somewhat of a Liberal ""peacenik,"" he was the kind you'd see out with a big ""peace sign"" at rallies against nuclear weapons.This movie had the kind of message that was dear to his heart.

Superman goes about trying to rid the world of nuclear weapons here, especially, of course when they get into the hands of villain ""Dr. Luthor"" (Gene Hackman). It was a nice message and, overall, a nice film. Unlike the other Superman films of the era, they didn't overdo the sappy romance with ""Lois Lane"" (Margot Kidder). They concentrated more on the story. Unfortunately, that story - even with good intentions - just wasn't all that memorable.

Ask anyone: people remember the first two Reeve Superman films a lot more than the last two. This one, and the third one with Richard Pryor, pretty much ""bombed"" at the box office, at least compared to the others.

It did not help that the producers of this movie were Golan-Globus films, guys that were known for their cheap and usually-sleazy exploitation films. ""Superman"" deserved better."
2602,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Superman 4 has good ideas and good performances, but was ruined when the director cut 40 minutes from the film before release. Among other things, the denouement in which Nuclear Man defies Luthor and turns himself into a nuclear missile in order to spark World War III. In order to see what the film should have been, I suggest one seek out the DC Comic Adaptation. This film, as Christopher Reeve's final performance as Superman deserves to be restored for DVD. The reason for Superman using powers he has never had, was the result of unfinished effects. The great wall of China scene should have been finished by adding Superman fixing the wall at super speed, and finished with Superman sealing it with heat visio"
2603,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Despite its reputation as the worst of the Superman movies, Superman IV: The Quest For Peace is not. Despite the horrendous special effects and rushed ending, the film manages to still present itself with some respect.

Christopher Reeves had proved in the three previous films his ability to convincingly play the role of Superman. With this film, he not only proves his abilities but this is, in many respects, his best performance in the role. His speeches during the film are a sign of this and his chemistry with all the other actors helps also. Reeves also does his best to sell the special effects sequences it is a shame he couldn't. Reeves is the films biggest saving grace and it's a shame this would be his last time in the role.

Gene Hackman also returns in the role of Lex Luthor and with brings him that character's with, charm, and silent menace. But somehow he seems to be out of place most of the time and serves as a drawback in many of his scenes. Mark McClure, Jackie Cooper and Margot Kidder all return in their roles. But unfortunately they are all under used and their appearances might as well be cameos.

The rest of the cast does a decent job. Mark Pillow does excellent in the role of Nuclear Man, Luthor's super powered creation. Pillow does the role so well that one wonders how much better eh might have been in the special effects had been better. Mariel Hemingway is a welcomed addition to the cast as a heiress who serves as an additional love interest for Clark Kent. The only major addition that doesn't fit is Jon Cryer who could easily be the single most annoying character to ever appear in a Superman movie.

The film's real drawback is its low budget values. While this doesn't affect the majority of sets, the Fortress of Solitude set in particular looks cheap when compared to the one found in previous films. The same can also be said of the Daily Planet set. The low budget would also hurt the film in the area a budget was needed most: special effects.

The previous films, for all their flaws, at least had decent special effects and mostly convincing flying sequences and this film has neither. The special effects are sub-par by virtually any standard and despite being made nearly a decade after the first movie the effects from the first movie are still more convincing. The truly horrific nature of this films effect sequences can be seen during the climactic battles between Superman and Nuclear Man. The added addition of new powers with bad special effects doesn't help either.

The other major problem is the pacing of the film. The first 50 minutes or so is sheer entertainment that's the set up the story of both Superman riding the world of nukes and Luthor's evil plan. The set up, however, is better then the execution of the ending, which is both rushed and disjointed. The subplots of Mariel Hemingway's character and the boy who inspired Superman's quest are both left unfinished for example. Whole scenes feel incomplete and the final battle is over far too quickly to be effective.

But the film does have a saving grace in its concept. The idea of taking Superman, the ultimate hero of America, and placing him into the timely situation of Cold War disarmament is a stroke of utter brilliance. The concept of Luthor and Nuclear Man added to it also serve as an interesting addition to the story and it makes for good entertainment when viewed in this context. But this concept is ruined by the rushed feeling of the ending. But one still has to give high marks to Christopher Reeves and the screenwriters for their concept.

The films does have another saving grace: its musical score. Like the Ken Thorne scores for II and III, Alexander Courage's score makes heavy use of the John Williams themes composed for the first film and is highly effective. The Courage adaptation never fails to use the Williams music to maximum effect and it's a shame that, at Courage's own request, it has yet to see release.

Despite its flaws in special effects and editing, Superman IV has saving graces in Christopher Reeves, the rest of the cast, the music, and the timely nature of the story. While nowhere near as good as Superman The Movie or Superman II and while not as bad as Superman III, the film still serves its purpose and is your average Superman adventure."
2604,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Superman 1 was such a classic movie, and 2 was almost as great - Superman 3 is not a great Superman movie, but as a piece of '80s American comedy / spoof it succeeds and has some very memorable scenes (notably Chris Reeve as the evil Superman). But Part 4 is just an awful film overall with few redeeming qualities. Reeve's admirable storyline works well, and the double date scene with Superman & Clark is very entertaining (similar to the style of Superman III). But it's when Superman IV tries to get serious and exciting in its action sequences that it fails miserably and becomes a cheesey, ridiculous farce that only succeeds in showing how pointless it was to make the film on such a small budget. The story's not bad and if Donner was directing and you had 100 million dollars you could do it now and create a great adventure movie with some classic comedy scenes and some exciting action sequences. But anyway, it's too late. For all its failings, every time you see it, it's still fairly watchable, mainly because you're always expecting it to magically be better this time around. It's not as bad as everyone makes out and far more creative and original on a 16 million budget than what Batman and Robin did with 100 million! If Batman and Robin's a 3 out of 10, then Superman IV's a 6 out of 10."
2605,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE pits the Man of Steel against Nuclear Man, Lex Luther's newest creation while ridding the world of nuclear weapons. This is easily the worst of the SUPERMAN movies, and it was doomed to fail right from the start. Cut from its original 134-minute version, it is full of plot holes resulting in a movie with some scenes that just don't make any sense, but even with the extra 45 minutes intact, the movie still wouldn't work because the special effects are cheap and ridiculous, and it shows. Unless you are a diehard fan of the Superman genre, this movie should be avoided.

Superman IV: The Quest For Peace

Directed by: Sidney J. Furie, 1987

Perversely bad. With major budget cuts (from $28 to $16m) and story problems, the moviemakers suddenly found themselves cutting corners in all areas. And it shows. Completely lacking in awe, fun and excitement, Superman IV most of all feels like a bad joke.

The fact that it comes across more cartoonish than the previous three is hardly intentional, as everything - from effects to dialogue - just seems oddly rushed and second-rate.

The only highlight is Gene Hackman - who returns in high spirits as Lex Luthor. Christopher Reeve co-scripted this time and he again personifies the Man of Steel. But most of his co-stars are either wasted (Mariel Hemingway) or hysterical (John Cryer).

The new villian, Nuclear Man (as played by Mark Pillow), looks like a Swedish showwrestler in a home-made Halloween suit, complete with mullet hair and horrendous over-acting mannerisms.

Director Sidney J. Furie (the man behind the otherwise taut thriller The Entity) seems unable to create any sparks and Superman IV falls completely flat, head first. Game over.

Note: Certain scenes had to be borrowed from the previous movies, most notably Superman and Lois on their romantic evening flight above the Manhattan skyline. How they even managed to make this scene look worse than in the original is really mind-boggling."
2607,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"This movie never should have been released. This movie is at the opposite end of the spectrum as far as favorites go for me. The 1978 original is one of my all time favorite films, while sitting through this one at the movies was like getting a root canal without the novocain. Special effects were horrible as well as character development and plot line. How could any studio head or those involved with the final print of this film feel comfortable with the finished project?

Talk about a film that rode on the popularity of its predecessors and failed to live up to any expectations that fans of the earlier films had. This movie certainly was the nail in the coffin as far as the Christopher Reeve Superman films go. And for what it's worth I fall in the category that feels Superman 3 was better than this mess.

Yet, among the wreckage are signs that there was a good film in here somewhere, as our hero struggles to decide whether or not to intervene in human history and the character's rather touching realisation that he is not just a visitor to Earth. A nicely-toned return to the Lois-Clark-Superman relationship also could have rooted the film back to its glorious predecessors - bar number three - but once Nuclear Man shows up and the film's story is cut in half, all promise and potential disappears from the project and the audience is left with a strictly mediocre re-tread of Superman I"

2611,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"I have watched this recently (early 2011) on the Deluxe DVD – picked up very cheaply to complete my set – I think for the first time since it came out. As a teenager, I am sure I enjoyed it as a piece of typical escapism, but I have come back to it now – screening a season for myself of all five Superman films – aware that people seem to think it's an all-time turkey. Well I am here to say that this really isn't fair.

As with so many things, it's all a matter of context – yes, alongside a modern equivalent superhero sequel, e.g. The Dark Knight or any of the X-Men follow-ups, it's pretty dire. But then alongside a contemporary equivalent – say, Highlander II: The Quickening or Ghostbusters 2 – it's almost sublime! (But then compared to Highlander II, nuclear war sounds like a pleasant diversion.)

Anyway, I am prepared to say that this is not even the worst Superman film! It's worthy of re-evaluation and it's genuinely worth seeing as part of the series.

Firstly, it's VERY 1980s when you watch it now. Big-hair-tastic and shoulder-pad-mungous. But this is comparable to any other film from that era, such as Robocop or Working Girl. And yes, infamously there are some extremely dodgy effects in the mix – but some of them are actually very good. This odd contrast is not so different from the previous films in the series, especially the first from 1978. And remember that Ghostbusters – released the previous year and winning an Oscar for its effects, no less – has some risible shots when you look at it now.

The real problem with Superman IV is that it's clearly been compromised in the making, ultimately put together without all the footage the director had planned to shoot. The infamous budget slashing by the studio is obvious in various scenes. While, jarringly, elsewhere you can see the money up on screen – the result being an uneven whole that's sadly less than the sum of its parts.

I shall have to check out the deleted scenes some time to see what potential was there. But as it is, there are so many plus points trying to save this film:

Gene Hackman is great as Lex Luthor again, with lots of good lines and villainous charm. he was shamefully wasted in Superman II, as was Kevin Spacey in this role in the turgid and unengaging Superman Returns. Hijacking the airwaves to lure Superman, Luthor signs off with V-for-victory signs and an ironic ""Peace!"" and I love the subsequent scene where he has his say/exercises his ego before our endlessly patient hero, constantly on the move and fixing himself a drink of champagne to toast the demise of his arch-enemy. (It's clear, too, that the film-makers decided to try to top his wonderful subterranean lair from the original film by having his new hideout a big Art Deco set for the top of Metropolis' equivalent of the Empire State Building.)

The rest of the returning cast all do a solid job and, of course, Christopher Reeve is excellent. As the clutzy Clark Kent, he mistimes his aerobics (so 80s again!) but slyly gets back at a bully, bumbles around the capable Margot Kidder's Lois Lane and compliments his new love interest on her dress – badly and only at Lois' prompting. And then, as the earnest Superman, wrestling with his conscience and making then-oh-so-valid points about the Cold War arms race and human frailties, he gives the film a weighty centre. A scene at the now deserted Kent farm is touching and there is even the revelation that, without his parents, he now seems to be in the habit of revealing his identity to Lois for some love and advice, then mind-wiping her (again) with a super-snog! She is not, it is strongly suggested, entirely unaware of this arrangement...

Lastly, Sidney J Furie is a very capable director and his work shines in certain scenes... while elsewhere you are left musing sadly on what might (should) have been. The double date is superbly handled – for example, there's a lovely shot where Clark quick-changes into Superman through a car parked outside revolving doors. And dare I say that the sequences where the 'Nuclear Man' goes on the rampage, around the world and then on the streets of Metropolis, are actually better handled, with more sense of scale and jeopardy than the three Kryptonian villains' not dissimilar activities in Superman II. Then there is the careful way Superman's famed all-American persona is, in this film (only, out of the five), balanced against a sense of him actually being an international figure, fluent in all languages and looking at the planet and the human race as one whole. In the opening scene we are presented with some Soviet cosmonauts who are shown to be 'just like you and me', neatly setting up the film's entire premise – which is eventually tied up with even the defeated Luthor asking an Eisenhower-quoting Superman if the Earth will be vapourised in WWIII and being told that, as always, the planet is ""on the brink with good fighting evil"".

So in conclusion: It's nowhere near as good as the original, epic Superman, nor does it work with anything like the brio of Superman III, which is pure entertainment in my book. But it scores over Superman II, which for me feels like it was too old-fashioned even upon its initial release and seems even more compromised in its mix of what works and what jars. While in last place I am afraid I must put the disappointingly wet and unimaginative Superman Returns."

2613,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"I cannot stand public opinion about the fourth and final Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" outing. ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"", while not the best of the entire series, is better than ""Superman III"" and better than Richard Lester's cartoonish ""Superman II"" (in which Lois Lane actually says, ""I'm going to change into something more comfortable"").

First of all, people have claimed that ""IV"" is the most physically ridiculous of all four. This is not true. Yes, for a human to fly in space, they would have to survive being burned up leaving Earth's atmosphere, then survive the vacuum of space (in other words, two people would have been dead by the end of the movie). However, let's revisit the 1978 original, in which the Man of Steel flies around the world, making it spin backwards, which also makes time reverse. If that really happened, every living thing and object on the planet's face would be flung off into the cold depths of space.

I won't linger on this anymore. Yes, ""The Quest for Peace"" has unbearable dialogue (in places), but it's classic Superman-- the cheese, the cheap effects, and the general cartoon feel. Plus, it does have Jon Cryer, in what is oddly his best performance of all time (you'd better believe it), and a solid message people still need to think about. In other words, come to believe a man can fly, stay for the inherent message of the movie: we would have to be very stupid to nuke our own planet."

2617,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE

OK... so everyone knows that this is the worst Superman movie ever made... but if you have not seen it in a while, you should watch it.

It is still pretty rubbish, but it is not as bad as I remember.

The story is not that bad... Superman rids planet Earth of all the nuclear weapons, and in doing so unknowingly creates a super villain named Nuclear Man thanks to arch rival Lex Luthor.

The movie does star all the original cast, which surprised me. I knew Christopher Reeve was in it... and after reading his autobiography now know why. He said in the book that he only made it because the film studio wanted to make it and they said to him that they would only finance another movie he wanted to make if he made Superman IV. I will quote what he said in his book... ""The less said about Superman IV the better.""

Gene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor & Margot Kidder is back as Lois Lane. They all did good jobs as always, although Margot was a bit unsure in places. The other supporting cast were not great. Mariel Hemingway played the new boss of the Daily Planet. She was awful... not a great actress in this I'm afraid. But she was not the worst. Mark Pillow played Nuclear Man. Absolutely terrible. His acting was definitely the worst of the whole quadrilogy.

The effects in this film were so bad. You could see that the budget of this film was so much less than the other 3 movies made. Superman flying was so bad that Flash Gordon was more convincing... and speaking of Flash Gordon... Nuclear Man looked like him... but more camp! Nuclear Mans outfit was embarrassing... it was not much of a super villains outfit. It honestly was just a bad character through and through.

There are also some really bad scenes... there was a scene where a large chuck of the Great Wall of China gets destroyed and Superman fixes it just by looking at it and using some dodgy blue eye lasers. What the hell? Terrible. Also, there is a scene where Nuclear Man kidnaps a Lacy and takes her into space... WHAT? He drags her to space and not only does she not scream or even say anything, but she can breathe fine in space... erm... really? I know Superman was never meant to be realistic, but that is too much!

When I was a kid I was a big fan of the Superman movies... but I think my parents protected me from this disappointment, because I don't remember this film at all... I didn't see this film until I was an adult. Haha. Thanks Mum.

I will give this film 5 out of 10.

It's a shame about this film... it was a very disappointing ending to Christopher Reeves Superman career. But no matter what he will always be a legend.

2618,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"I have just watched the 89 minute cut of superman 4 and i've asked myself is this a stinker of a film or not and my answer to that is no i don't think it is.

Why you ask when most of the world thinks it is well i shall tell you.

Well it's world renowned that cannon were cheapskates and the budget was only 10 million on this film but that aside what Sidney j furie did with this film was i think a much better film than superman 3.

I liked the story the acting i think was on par with the other films and i enjoyed the action scene's especially the fight around the world with the nuclear man and it kept me entertained however there are bad points about this film as much as it kept me entertained which included Lenny who was as about as much use in this film as a chocolate tea pot and ""THE NUCLEAR MAN"" what purpose does he serve in this film he is that bad that Gene Hackman has to voice him so i can only imagine Marc pillow was more wooden than a park bench and also when superman and nuclear man are fighting in space it's so obvious that they are on a blacked out stage.

What really bothers me about this film is that somebody out there has the full 143 minute version and i think this is the problem with superman 4 the general public have seen a watered down version which in some places this film makes no sense where as the full version that was laughed at by critics in an advanced screening would make more sense than this version we have to put up with and lets face it the real critics are real movie fans who do not get paid for there views unlike these posh art house lovers who would dissect care bears the movie if they had the chance.

In closing i would like to say two things about this movie (1) This film is voted one of the worst films of all time because we have a watered down version that makes no sense in places.

(2)Warner brothers or cannon whoever has the rights to the full uncut version do the decent thing and give us the general public and superman lovers across the world the the right to view superman 4 the quest for peace in it's full uncut glory if not for us then let's have Christopher reeve doing what he does best in these films and entertaining us and believing that a man can really fly"
2619,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"This is a fun film. Haters are going to hate, but Superman was never supposed to be a dark comic like the man of steel shows him to be. Sit back, relax and enjoy this awesome flic"

2622,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"I don't know how many of you followed the comic books in the 1960s as I did, but this was the period when Marvel was getting all the comic book readers that were leaving DC in the dust. That was because the stories got increasingly juvenile and silly, and tried to too hard to be decent and honorable and a teacher of sorts. In other words... boring!

Yet even in this time, the DC comics were simple fun escapism and the artwork of Curt Swan made it palatable to the eye. The same could be said of Superman IV: The Quest For Peace. The budget was obviously lower and the platitudes higher (due to Christopher Reeve's need to make a statement about nuclear proliferation) but the film as its moments of excitement, particularly in the scene between Superman and the manufactured super-villain of Lex Luthor, a sort of Sun-Man.

I still prefer it to be second film in the series. That one, at least for me, really bit the big one. That's why I rate it higher than Superman II."
2623,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"The fourth film of the Superman(Christopher Reeve) saga has Superman pursuing a greater goal besides fighting for justice and romancing Lois Lane:eliminate the threat of Nuclear Arms on the World. This movie is one of my favorite Superman installments(after Superman 2).It has it all: a original plot( Superman's quest for peace), the return of Superman's arch nemesis, Lex Luthor(played remarkably by Gene Hackman), a super villain just as powerful as Superman, Nuclear Man( the fighting scenes between them are outstanding), and new changes like the Daily Planet becoming a tabloid news paper. I was surprised to hear that this movie flopped at the box office and it was very criticized by fans, critics and viewers.In my opinion this film sunk because its message was very controversial.Even more Superman ceased to be an American exclusivity and look forward to every nations interests. The opening scene when Superman help a group of Russian cosmonauts in space , wow in 1987, i can only assume the thoughts of many viewers back then.The movie even suggested that there was an economical angle concerning the nuclear arms race(mainly through Lex Luthor).From my point of view, the reason this film flopped is because it meddled in to Politics.For many people super heroes belong in comic books, facing fictional problems( like for instance, an alien invasion).However it's very illogic to assume that Superman with all that power wouldn't take a stand on serious issues like nuclear arms and relegate to minor issues like saving a cat stuck on a tree.Many people expressed their dislike on this movie by focusing on the special effects.But not the entire movie has lower grade special effects, in fact there are only a few scenes.My favorite scenes like Superman worldwide chase of nuclear man, Superman missile round up in space, birth of nuclear man, metropolis show down have very good special effects. Nevertheless this movie didn't make it and it could be added to the list of films that flopped because of the audiences subjectivity.Botton line, yeah i like Superman 4 and i recommend it to anyone that haven't seeing it. In the other hand if anyone wants to see a Superman movie that's really Bad, see Superman Returns, this movie really sucks, and the irony is that it has great special effects.As anyone can't see, special effects are just one of several elements to analyze in a movie."

2625,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"""Superman IV: The Quest For Peace"" is a definite improvement over the embarassing ""Superman 3"".

The cast give sincere performances despite the film's flaws with Christopher Reeve handing in another great performance as Clark Kent/Superman.

""Superman 4"" is a flawed film, most notably the special effects and the bad editing, as well as the cut scenes, but I like the film.

Alexander Courage's adaptation of John Williams' music is lovely and is certainly much better than Ken Thorne's version in ""Superman 2"". It's a shame there's no Superman 4 soundtrack available to purchase.

""Superman 4: The Quest For Peace"" is a decent film, and one I certainly don't mind watchi"
2626,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"I maybe in the small percentage here but I thought this movie was a good solid comic book film. OK your probably thinking I'm mental for liking a film thats got a review of 3.3...but bear with it as I will explain why I like it.

OK first off when I was younger I watched a film that had superman in it and a superman in a black costume....but I could never remember what superman it was, I knew it wasn't the first one or the third because I had them on video, so it was bound to be the second.

When superman two was on sky movies I watched it and to my shock it didn't have that bit of cinema and action that I remembered watching as a child. After countless google searches I finally found out there was a superman four so quickly got hold of a copy and watched it...this is where the review begins.

To begin with it has almost all the original cast back for the final film of the series, which is nice on its own, the opening sequence is (I will admit) abit poor compared to the previous films but when you hear the music you know your watching a superman film. Anyway the film goes on and superman starts to deal with issues that are important, a child writes to him and asks him to take all the nuclear weapons off earth and destroy them, to begin with superman isn't too sure on the idea. Anyway in the end he does destroy them, mean while Lex Luthor steals one of superman's hairs from a museum and uses it to create Nuclear Man, basically an evil superman...well it's almost exactly like superman except hes blonde and needs the sun to get energy on a more extreme level than superman.

Still the movie has some great action sequences and fits in well to the other superman films, though you do have to take this for what it is ""a comic book movie"" it is good at what it is, you have to watch it and forget everything you where ever taught or believe...OK some of the stuff like the fight on the moon is abit extreme but it's a SUPERman movie. I can only suggest you watch this movie but just don't take it seriously it is a nice movie to watch and it is memorable which I hope is the message you got from the beginning of this review."
2627,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"I wrote a review of this telling you how bad it was. I changed my mind. I actually enjoy the movie. I used to watch it only to laugh at it, but it turned out later I wasn't watching it anymore to laugh. I love this movie. It's not as good as the other Superman movies in the series, but it is still good. I also used to say that Mark Pillow was horrible as Nuclear Man because of how corny he was. I was wrong. He is good as Nuclear Man because the way he is you would think you were reading a comic. Christopher Reeve of course is great as Superman and I enjoyed the acting of his co-stars. I complained about the special effects, but I read about how much trouble the filmmakers went through to get this movie finished. One thing though that still stands as something I dislike is one, the mistake in the end of having Nuclear Man fly Lacey Warfield up into space and two, the fight on the moon. There are some good moments in the moon fight, but Superman acts like a wimp in some parts and doesn't know how to fight. He stomps on Nuclear Man's foot, he takes Nuclear Man's head and brings it into his knee and he tries to kick(tap) Nuclear Man and it results in Nuclear Man throwing him. But one last thing about the scene that I love is how Superman walks over to the American flag and stands it back up. Great stuff. There are only plot holes in the movie because a lot of it was cut because of idiots in Orange County that didn't like it. Thanks to them we have a movie second rate to the original version. This could've been one of the best in the series. It is still very good though. If you want to collect Superman movies don't leave this one out."

2630,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"The whole story and concept are just as ridiculous as the ones for Superman II & III but difference with those movies was that it was obvious that they didn't took themselves too seriously with as a result some entertaining B-movie fun. ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" however takes itself far too serious, which makes the ridicules story and concept seem even more ridicules. The movie could had certainly used some more humor and comical situations and characters.

The movie had still quite some potential to be honest but the weak directing and storytelling makes this a movie filled with holes and loose ends. Some moments are just completely unbelievable and there are more than a few obvious goofs in the movie and the story.

It's surprising to see that Gene Hackman actually agreed to return in this movie after his absence in ""Superman III"". Not even he can give the movie a fun and light feeling. His character is terribly underused in the movie and the real main villain of the movie (Nuclear Man) is only introduced towards the ending of the movie. Nuclear Man is a pretty decent villain but he is simply introduced too late in the movie to leave a lasting impression.

Not even Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder seem to feel at ease in this movie. They were both great in the previous 3 Superman movies but they really don't seem to feel comfortable with this movie its script and dialog.

The special effects look absolutely horrible and are by far the worst of any of the Superman movies.

Yes, the movie does still have some entertainment value and it still has some good superhero elements in the movie but overall it's a movie not really worth watching. The directing and the script are weak and not even the normally fine actors can make the movie fun or believable enough. All that is left now is a silly, horrible mess.

2631,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"I don't like the Salkind's. I feel that they treated Richard Donner and many others members of the cast and crew with unforgivable dis-respect. However, I can't help but feel for them just a little when it comes to Superman IV: The Quest For Peace. Sure they may have bank-rolled Three, which was a bit of a turkey in its own right, but then they had to sit back and see Supe's fourth incarnation absolutely butchered by the God-awful Cannon films. In fact, they were probably laughing. 'Ha ha, even we could have done better than that!'

Superman IV really, really needs a major overhaul. It'll never happen of course, but it would be fun to see it. The forty-five odd minutes of cut footage could be judiciously re-integrated into the film, whilst removing or re-editing existing stuff. (get rid of Nuclear Man taking Lacy out for a quick spin in space for a start - she would have been dead long before she could see the stars!!!) Then get hold of the original source prints for all the effects footage and digitally re-composite them to eliminate all the horrendous matte-lines. Remove the wires from the flying shots, and re-film the opening credits, which are, let's be honest, lame in the extreme. Then re-master the entire print, and upgrade the sound to 5.1 (hell, even DTS), add a load of extras and release the thing on DVD. I'd buy it!!!

Okay, okay, I know I'm dreaming. It'll never happen, just as we're pretty unlikely to see a Donner re-cut of Superman II. But the way I see it, if Anchor Bay can do such a bang-up job on Supergirl, with a Special Director's Cut well over two hours long, Warners could at least treat the Superman-loving public to longer cuts of their favourite films. Even if the deleted scenes were just that: deleted scenes as a DVD extra.

What do you think?

End of rant - move along people, just go on back to your lives!"

2633,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace is a good movie, but it was a failure in my opinion. It was great seeing the Superman cast back together again, including Gene Hackman who we haven't seen since Superman II. This time, Alexander and Ilya Salkind were not producing the movie. Instead, Menaham Golan and Yoram Globus, the owners of Cannon films, were producing. If you ask me, the Salkinds knew how to make a Superman movie better than those two.

In Superman IV, Superman hears the threat of Nuclear War over and over, and so he decides that he will rid the world of every nuclear weapon known to man. At the same time, Lex Luthor has broken out of jail again and this time, his sidekick is his dorky nephew Lenny. The two criminals create a device that they put on one of the nuclear weapons and that ends up creating Nuclear Man. Nuclear Man has the same powers as Superman but, the only difference is that Nuclear Man gets his power from the sun.

While all of this is going on, The Dailey Planet is being controlled by a tycoon and his daughter who has her eye on Clark Kent.

So Superman has a big job here: SAVE THE WORLD FROM NUCLEAR DESTRUCTION!

I'm going to say that, anyone who has seen the first three Superman films, then just go ahead and see IV because it would be a shame to not see the film that is last in the series. But, in my opinion, I didn't like it much. I think Alexander & Ilya Salkind would've made a hell of a last movie."
2634,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"The final adventure of Superman is by far his worst. Granted Superman III isn't much better, but at least it was not as contrived as this one.

First of all, let's look at the good parts of this movie, it is a short list. Christopher Reeve came up with an excellent story for this film and it reflected the times that the world was facing. Riding the world of nuclear weapons was a good start, a nice foundation to build on; unfortunately there was not enough money to finish the film and it was released unfinished.

The other nice things about this film are the return of Lex Luthor,and the return to seriousness in the film series. One can only wonder how this movie would have turned out had all the necessary funding been there.

The special effects are just plain horrible, and the audience winces as Superman makes his 'dramatic entrance' by saving a space capsule from spinning into the Earth's atmosphere and rescuing a man falling into space. Everytime Reeve is in flight, the animated Superman is obvious to everyone, and it is sad to see this; for the audience no longer believes a man can fly, but that a cartoon can instead.

So many scenes are deleted from this movie that it is confusing to understand just how certain key elements of the film are executed, or worse yet, why!

The only scene which holds interest for a little while is the climatic battle between Superman and Nuclear Man, at best the scene gets a mediocre.

So far this has been the final entry of the Superman series, and although the film is exceptionally weak. Christopher Reeve once again sparkles as the Man of Steel. He always gave an excellent performance as Superman even when the movies where sub-par, and that speaks plenty.

At least the ending to this movie is done well with Superman flying out of the Earth and smiling at us as he flies off into space, protecting the world; that alone will always inspire some kind of hope to people."

2637,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Clark Kent/Superman (Christopher Reeve) is still having saving people lives in Metropolis and sometimes the whole world, when he is flying. In the time, when the nuclear war might still happen between the American and the Russians. The world is still never safe and people still lives in fear. But when a young boy named Jeremy (Damian McLawhorn) thinks that Superman could disarmed the whole entire nuclear war by writing an personal letter to the Daily Planet. Superman sees in the boy's point of the letter, he decides to talk to the United Nations for peace on earth. But things are slowly changing, when Superman's number one enemy Lux Luthor (Two Time Oscar-Winner:Gene Hackman) is having plans to kill Superman once and for all with the help of Luthor's nephew (Jon Cryer) by using a piece of Superman's hair by creating an super-clone named Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow). A super-clone so powerful that is radiation charged. Now Superman has to find ways to destroy Nuclear Man before he gets Lux Luthor.

Directed by Sidney J. Furie (The Entity, Iron Eagle) made an amusing, intentionally campy if extremely cheap sequel to ""Superman"" films. This fourth movie was produced (sadly) by the king of low-budget pictures of the 1980's Cannon Films. Which Cannon Films were going down, when ""Superman 4"" was produced after they were involved with box office disappointments like ""Lifeforce"", ""Invaders from Mars remake"" and ""Over the Top"". Originally Warner Bros give Cannon Films $40 million to produced the fourth picture but they only used $17 million to make it. They used the rest of the $23 million by producing other movies sadly. Special Visual Effects of this one truly did hurter the movie, there's only a very few F/X sequences were good but not many to make it memorable like the first two films. Also ""Superman 4"" feels choppy at times, not everything is logical in the story. While many scenes hit the cutting room floor before it was release. If the producers or the director kept some of the scenes that make some sense in the story. The premise could have been much more.

But on the plus side, what i feel make ""Superman 4"" watchable is the good performances from the cast. Reeve is terrific as always in the title role. Hackman is a joy seeing him playing the villain. Margot Kidder as Lois Lane is also fun as well. I did like the new characters in the film played by Cryer as Luthor's nephew and Mariel Hemingway as Lucy Warfield. Which Hemingway plays the daughter of a billionaire tycoon who bought The Daily Planet and she also finds herself attractive to Clark character. Pillow isn't bad in his only film as the villain but when he speaks, it is unintentionally funny most of the time.

DVD Version from the recent Deluxe Edition. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an decent Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD includes an fascinating commentary by Mark Rosenthal (Star Trek 6:The Undiscovered Country, The Beverly Hillbilles, Stephen King's Sometimes They Come Back). Which the co-screenwriter of the film talks about how Cannon treated the production badly, why the special effects looks so lame comparing to the previous films, character developments and the scenes were deleted from the picture. DVD also includes Deleted Scenes from the work-print (Which some are fascinating) but they don't including some of the deleted footage what Rosenthal mention in the commentary and the original theatrical trailer.

""Superman 4:The Quest for Peace"" was a major box office flop in the summer of 1987. But it somehow find life on video and it's great entertainment for the kids. Reeve came up with the premise of this feature along with Rosenthal and Co-Screenwriter Lawerence Konner (The Jewel of the Nile, Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes, Mercury Rising). Which Reeve wasn't sure if he wanted to do another Superman film if Cannon Films will help produced one of Reeve's personal project called ""Street Smart"". Which that film was notable for Oscar-Nominated Supporting Performance by Oscar-Winner:Morgan Freeman as the violent pimp. But Reeve at the time, he felt he could make it up for the Superman 3. For his career at that time, it seems to make it much worse. But i think for me anyway, i felt ""Superman 4"" was improvement story-wise from the third film. Also nothing could top the villain Luthor as well, no matter what the screenwriter could come up with. Die Hard fans of the comic-books or the films might be more forgiving with this one. Joe-Dunton-Camera Scope (J-D-C Scope). (*** 1/2 out of *****)."

2642,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"This is a truly frustrating film. Somewhere in this mess is a good film that isn't allowed to break free, haphazard and lazy direction from a mediocre director and two very lame scriptwriters make sure of that.

The idea in itself isn't bad. Superman becomes active in disarming the world of nuclear weapons but his arch nemesis Lex Luthor still holds a grudge against the Man of Steel and devices a plan to get rid of him; by creating a super villain of his own.

Reeve shares co-credit story this time around but he's not responsible for the terrible script. There are good things floating around but executed in the poorest manner. And what's more the special effects are terrible, I can't believe they saved money on that front. The film moves along too fast, clocking in at under 90 minutes and some interesting angles are not explored nearly well enough.

So what's good here? Well, Reeve of course. He IS Superman and once again delivers a fantastic performance and shows all too well that he's way too good for this film. Margot Kidder is good as well but her role is minimal and Jackie Cooper appears all too briefly. So that leaves Hackman. Of course it's good to see him, he's a very good actor, but one can't help but think he got a big paycheck and simply did what he had to and nothing more. He doesn't look too excited.

A wasted opportunity this film. Could have been very good but looks incredibly rushed and made without passion. But it's always good to see Reeve in flying action."

The once ground breaking effects look outdated and mediocre at best. We once were made to believe a man could fly. Now it was old hat and nothing new or innovative was being done to take us beyond that.

2646,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"It's very, very sad that Superman IV: the quest for peace ended abruptly its franchise, because the idea of nuclear disarmament was a very good topic to discuss at the end of Cold war. With a severed budget, uninspired dialogs, plot inconsistencies, dull special FX (especially when Superman is suspended by thin wires on the moon and when Lacy Warfield is in space without a breathing apparatus) and a ridiculous and laughably villain, how a Superman movie can be enjoyable ? As far as I'm concerned none of these problems can resolve its own.

The film is so much different from the previous installments, and I felt a little alienated and lost while watching it. However I liked some moments, the best ones were with the campy Nuclear Man who shouted more than he spoke (he looks more like an extravagant wrestler than a clone of Superman) The final line was very prophetic while being ironic, and I'm glad that Superman returns is far more better than this monumental farce...

Steve Baillargeon"
2647,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Well to say that the final chapter in the Superman series was a big let down is an understatement. I have read many people's opinion on this movie and agree that it could have been a way better film. Though the film's theme does have some merit attached to it.

Superman IV is about the man of steel grappling with his emotions of his now home planet, Earth. He is afraid the planet could suffer the same fate as his mother planet Krypton. Superman agrees to rid the planet of the threat of nuclear war. But the mastermind of the greatest criminal in the modern era, Lex Luthor, uses the Superman peace bid to create ciaos. His new creation is a Frankenstein like being, a Nuclear Man. Can Superman stop the Earth from blowing itself up?

Actors such as Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman were crazy when they agreed to do this film. I know that Reeve helped to write the story to this film, and the whole nuclear war theme was quite fine. But tell me if I am wrong, the big screen version never turned out the way it was suppose to? Reeve was good again as Clark Kent/Superman (but only when his feet were on the ground). The flying sequences in this Superman were atrocious. Scenes like when Lois Lane and Superman fly around together. These scenes look fake. The original Superman gave me the impression that this bloke really could fly. But this film makes a mockery of the Superman name. I must commend the speech of Superman to the world congress on nuclear war, it was quite touching and when you watch the movie up to this point, I thought hey this might be alright. But how wrong was I?

Gene Hackman made the role of Lex Luthor his own. Yet, I am amazed he even wanted anything to do with reprising the Luthor role. Not that he was bad, but the film itself was. Hackman since then, has had to reinvent himself in films like Enemy of the state, which I enjoyed immensely. It is only lucky he didn't ruin his whole career. Another of his better films was the Quick and the Dead, starring alongside Hollywood beauty Sharon Stone. Margot Kidder was back in Superman IV and I did enjoy parts of her in this. Lois' emotions towards Superman were well acted by Kidder. Looking at Kidder's career since this film nothing really stands out to me though. Margot has had bad luck in the last ten years, being in a serious car crash, managing maniac depression and requiring psychiatric care. I do remember that she went through a tough trot.

I will tell you which cast members weren't quite that super. First of all, Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow). It is fine to have a menacing look about you, but aren't you suppose to able to act a bit also? Pillow was a terrible choice in this role. The other point is that I haven't seen or heard anything of this guy since. The other crappy part to his role was that Gene Hackman supplied the voice of his character. The Nuclear man character was ok, but could have had a better actor playing him. Then you have the attractive actress Mariel Hemingway, who played Lacy Warfield. The daughter of tycoon David Warfield (Sam Wanamaker). As good looking as Hemingway is, her character in this was of no importance at all. Likewise Wanamaker, who just makes up the numbers, plus the whole take over bid of the Daily Planet didn't make much sense to me. Last of all I want to talk about Jon Cryer. He played Luthor's nerdy nephew, Lenny. He was terrible and a complete waste of time being in this film in my view. I also read somewhere, has anyone seen Jon Cryer since Superman IV? My answer to that is yes, in a film titled Holy Man starring would you believe Eddie Murphy, Jeff Goldblum and the gorgeous Kelly Preston.

I have mentioned some scenes in Superman IV that I liked and that I disliked. Another favourite was when Lacy and Lois had a double date with Clark and Superman. This scene was well acted and cleverly done. Superman was up and down this tall building for the entire scene. Reeve's talent's again shone through with this. The only problem with this scene was that it totally gives away who Superman's secret identity really is. Anyone in their right mind should know after having a double date with the guy. The worst scene in the film is when Nuclear man takes Lacy Warfield after falling in love with her. Superman discovers that Nuclear man's energy comes from the sun and shifts the moon's orbit to block the sun. Meanwhile Lacy is dragged into outer space. I don't know who got this wrong, but no earthling can breathe in space without help can they? So why didn't Lacy die huh?

The other dilemma this film had was that the budget was cut back. After a test screening, it was reduced from 134 to 90 minutes. I say that the edit button destroyed this film. Scenes were deleted or cut. It might (I stress might) have helped if I could have seen the whole film. I read the book to Superman IV and admit that I actually enjoyed reading it. I hope we get to see what was taken out of this film on the DVD of Superman IV.

All in all this was a movie which probably never had a chance to succeed. With poor special effects, ordinary cast and a shortened version that really did kill it. I want to wish Christopher Reeve all the best in his recovery from his quadriplegia. I will always remember him as Superman, on the big screen and in real life. I am afraid to say that this film gave Superman a bad name.

Rating: 2 out of 5 Stars or 4/10."
2648,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Superman IV is a mix of good and bad things.

The good things-1: The intention of the movie; its good, Superman X nuclear weapons is coherent because is one of worst enemies of humanity.

2: The cast; Reeve and Hackman gives a bit of light in film, but Jon Cryer and Mark Pillow aren't good.

The bad things-1: The production of film is poor, very poor, the FX effects, the flying effects are horrible for a Superman film. The Golan/Goblus production isn't competent in anyway.

2: The plot could be better, much better...The nuclear Man, Superman talking in space after to save astronauts, Lacy Warfield in space, the Moon's scenes and Luthor's escape of jail are some examples of the mistakes in the plot, but some scenes like the Superman speech is OK.

The film's intention is really good, but intention is never enough."
2649,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"The way ""Superman IV - The Quest for Peace"" is referred by critics and conventional wisdom is absolutely unfair. It is accused of killing Superman series, quitting Christopher Reeve's portrayals of the man of steel and delaying in two decades a new Superman film. Blame Cannon Films' budget constraints, not all the movie. Off course, ""Superman IV"" has flaws. Due to Cannon Films's bankruptcy, there was not enough money to resume properly an expensive movie like that (budget shrank from US$ 36 million to US$ 17 million). Therefore, special effects are much worse than the ones used in its prequels, and scenes have been filmed without appropriate conditions (scenario, extras etc). To summarize, the film has been released ""unfinished"", as one of the actors, Jon Cryer (yes, Alan from ""Two and a half men""), stated. Besides that, they invented some powers which are not this superhero's traditional ones, such as telekinesis (though, a power General Zod had in ""Superman II"") or creating bricks with the X-ray (indeed, the Great Wall scene is particularly amateur). The super-villain Nuclear Man, although not visually bad, suffered with poor text and bad acting. I also disliked campy Lenny (22 years old Jon Cryer), Lex Luthor's nephew. Though, ""Superman IV"" also has merits, which should be acknowledged. First of all, its plot is interesting and not less sophisticated than most of superhero movies (not to confuse complexity with mess, as many recent superhero films have bad explained stories disguised as story richness). Besides that, there are many nice jokes, enjoyable situations and good dialogues. Once again, Christopher Reeve does an amazing job as Clark Kent and Superman, and Gene Hackman and Margot Kidder also have great performances in their roles of Luthor and Lois Lane. Instead of pure empty action, ""Superman IV"" also brings an important message of peace and criticizes both USA and USSR for their stupid military over-investments. This trait would have also been reinforced if some very nice deleted scenes had been included in final cut (they are available as special features in DVD, together with horrible footage with the first version of Nuclear Man). Besides that, the movie also reminds how the press is responsible for the outcomes of its reports. The final message is a praiseworthy support for political engagement. The bad fame of ""Superman IV"" has been so often sustained that people do not watch this film anymore, letting no chances for its reputation be reconsidered. That is a shame. It is worse than excellent Superman I and II, off course, and, in my opinion, also than ""Superman Returns"", but I consider it much better than campy ""Superman III"" and much truer to our dear character than revisionist Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel""."
2650,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"This is the fourth and final Superman film with Christopher Reeve taking on the role, where he tries to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and battles Lex Luther (Gene Hackman) and his super-powered sidekick, Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow).

Though the level of excitement and intrigue of this film doesn't match the first two, it is almost on par with the third and is still fun and fast-paced with neat special effects that showcase Superman's powers and great action scenes, something that sorely lacks in Superman Returns.

The nuclear weapons plot I thought was clever and unique to a Superman movie. Total disarmament of nuclear weapons may not be feasible in the real world, but Superman's quest for peace among all countries is well-intended in the film. Reeve is great as Superman and Gene Hackman gave us another thrilling performance as super villain Lex Luther. In addition, the fight scenes between Nuclear Man and Superman were awesome - Nuclear Man looked like a force to be reckon with as he possessed the same level of powers and same physique as Superman.

Overall, I think this film is a fitting ending to the Christopher Reeve saga.

Grade B-"
2651,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Wow, I honestly cannot believe how Superman became so famous if these movies were anything to go by, because the forth installment started off very well, but ended up with a ton of mistakes. It wasn't just the story, because the story worked very well, but not to spoil anything, but Lex wants a strand of Superman's hair that supposedly can hold 1000 pounds, he not only just cuts the strand from the museum, you'll see what I mean, but it also snaps in his hand. And that girl Lucy, somehow could breathe in space, not to mention, is it a good idea to hurl nuclear missiles at the sun?

Well, Superman is still struggling to keep his identity, which miraculously no one has still caught onto yet, and they even changed how he makes people forget if they've seen the real him. Well, Lucy, the big time Daddy's girl is now the publisher at the newspaper company that Louis and Clark are at. When they receive a letter from a little boy asking Superman to destroy all nuclear missiles to save the world, but Superman has a bigger problem when Lex Luther escapes and makes Nuclear Man, a man who is as equally strong, with one flaw, he needs the sun to keep up.

Superman IV isn't a bad movie, but it wasn't made too well, and it didn't seem too well thought out. Christopher Reeve also just seemed tired of doing Superman, it just wasn't his best. But if you are looking to finish the Superman series, then be my guest, but otherwise, I'd recommend to stay away, because it's not that well thought out.

2652,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"I will not succumb to the temptation of reminding everyone once again how terrible the special effects are and how many times one can see the supporting wires. Instead I will focus on the few good aspects of the movie. Chris Reeve is once again great in being superman and Gene Hackman is an absolute joy to watch as the menacing Luthor with only one thing on his mind ""Destroy superman"". The references to the first two movies e.g.flying sequence with Lois Lane and the well known score remind us of why they were so successful.

I agree with the nonsensical space sequence but not so much with superman moving the moon. It's a comic book movie after all and in the first film he managed to get the earth out of orbit! You know the whole idea of a man flying and being invincible is quite impossible so why don't you pick on that too? In superman's world anything can happen.

However what is painful for me personally is Warner Bros not being bothered to refurbish superman 4 just like Lucas did with the original star wars trilogy(added better sound, new scenes e.g. Hayden Christensen at the end of the return of the Jedi). They could use modern technology and hide the visible wires and improve the flying sequences. I am sure it won't be expensive. Plus why not even restore the 45 minutes of deleted footage? Dick Donner did so in the first film and also later this year a new restored cut of superman 2 is coming out with all the deleted Donner footage. Why not patch up a low budget effort and restore superman's former glory?

For the performances of Reeve, Hackman and the rest of the common superman characters I chose to give this film 5 out of 10 and I hope that one day we will see it patched up."
2653,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"There is a sort of stigma that surrounds this film. Superman fans either love it or hate it, and the general viewer mostly despises it. Indeed, in comparison to the other Superman films (1 and 2 especially), this entry leaves very much to be desired. I tend to stand on the middle ground when it comes to an opinion on this movie, and I'll tell you why.

Many people know the production history behind Superman IV. The Salkinds gave up the rights to Superman and low-budget studio Canon Films eagerly snatched them up. Christopher Reeve had previously stated that he would never don the red cape again, but with the Salkinds out of the picture and and the assurance that he could contribute to the script, he went right back to the role. The rest of the original cast also came back, also because the Salkinds were out. With all of this lined up and a great budget provided by Warner Brothers, Superman IV was slated to be a film that went back to serious tone of the original two. Of course, Canon slashed the budget in mid-production due to bankruptcy and a disastrous screening in Orange County left 45 minutes of footage on the cutting room floor. When it was finally released, Superman IV had been butchered, beaten, and severely under advertised. The best intentions went awry, and for many fans, the Superman film legacy had ended on a sad and heart-breaking note.

I agree, there is something sad and heart breaking about it, mainly that the movie was probably much more epic than what we were left with. The 45 minutes left out of the film involved a titanic battle between Superman and a prototype Nuclear Man and established the sub-plots that connected the rest of the film together. If such footage had been left in, the quality of the film could have been greatly increased.

The other gut-wrenching thing about the film is the intentions behind it. Reeve and the people involved had wanted to make a film that spoke to fans and to the world about the evils of nuclear weaponry. Behind it all, the movie had a heart, and sadly, many people failed to realize it.

There is no denying that there are some terrible moments in this film. Many times can you see the strings of Superman and/or Nuclear Man and the flying is no where nearly as beautiful or inspiring as it was in the other entries. On the moon you can see the folds in the black curtain of space and Superman is ""gifted"" with many powers that do not exist in the Superman mythos (he fixes the Great Wall just by looking at it). Despite these numerous errors, Superman IV does have some great moments. Christopher Reeve delivers a flawless performance of Superman and Clark Kent yet again and Gene Hackman is fantastic as Lex Luthor. The movie should be watched, if anything, for the UN speech. It is beautiful and carries a meaning in our current world.

All in all, Superman IV is a technical disappointment in comparison to the other films. It does, however, provide what the third film sorely lacked, and that was heart. We should not easily dismiss this movie, however simple it may seem to do so. May we hope that someday the lost footage will be restored."

2655,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"The fourth ""Superman"" movie has unconvincing, occasionally embarrassing special effects and a naive, puerile script. On the other hand, Christopher Reeve almost singlehandedly carries it along! Still dashing as Superman, still funny as the engagingly clumsy Clark Kent; there is a sequence in which he has to be both almost simultaneously (the double date) which is an example of perfect comic timing. Margot Kidder and (especially) Mariel Hemingway are also pretty good. But Gene Hackman is mostly a nuisance here (and that goes double for his sidekick), and the ""Nuclear Man"" would be more at home in a ""Hercules"" movie. "

I can't believe Superman IV is not only ranked lower than Superman III, but that it's on the Bottom 100 list. Granted, this is by no means a great movie or very good at all, but there are definitely more than 100 other movies that are worse. Superman III is one of those, in which the opening credits set up the rest of the movie for failure (having everybody in town falling down, running into things, tripping over other people, etc. and not having that tie in to the plot is not a good start to a movie. It is just ridiculous and tells the viewer not to give this movie any respect). If it were me, I would put Superman IV at maybe a 4 or 5 (no higher), and Superman III at a 3 at the mo"

2659,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"""Superman IV: Quest for Peace"" should have been renamed ""Superman IV: Quest for a Plot"" as the film's script is pure garbage...full of schmaltz, preachiness and so many things that simply are dumb and make little sense. It's also a film that clearly shows the limits of special effects, as even with 1980s technology the film should have looked so much better--especially since it's about the most effects-laden Superman film up to that time.

The story is full of saccharine when the entire planet stops to take notice of some little boy who writes to Superman to request that he bring about world peace! Superman, never wanting to disappoint any child, responds by destroying the world's nuclear stockpile. However, Lex Luthor disguises one of the nuclear missiles as just a garden variety nuclear bomb when really it's infused with some Superman DNA. So, when the missile is tossed into the sun, it naturally produces an evil Krytonian who is bent on killing Superman and working for Luthor. Can our incredibly plastic hero destroy this evil menace AND balance two women...one who is beautiful and loves Clark and another who's an idiot who STILL can't understand that Clark and Superman are the same freaking guy!!

While the story is saccharine and stupid and the special effects quite bad, the film team do manage to also make the acting terrible- -even by Superman standards. The standout in this department is Jon Cryer-- who really can act. But given the bilge the writers (a room full of baboons, I think), he comes off as simply annoying and hateful. The rest, by the way, aren't much better.

So do I recommend this film? Yes and no. No if you want to see a decent film. Yes if you are either using it to torture someone or if you are a glutton for punishment, like me, and occasionally enjoy laughing at Hollywood stars destroying themselves. A little schadenfreude is what's needed to enjoy this picture, that's for sure."
2660,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"You've heard from many different reviews how bad this movie is. But this is no ordinary bad movie. This was a Superman movie about one of the greatest superheroes of all time. This was the fourth in the series and expectations were high. Everyone involved in making this movie failed and let everyone down. Superman IV: The Quest for Peace had a lot of potential to be a good movie, but it was put in the wrong hands.

One thing that I must point out is how they ruined the film's villain. Nuclear Man could've been a great villain, but like I said, this movie was put into the wrong hands. What a lot of people don't know is that in the original cut, there were two Nuclear Men. The first was the inferior one that resembled Bizarro from the comics. Nuclear Man came from one of Superman's hairs. The deleted scenes of the first Nuclear Man were pretty good. The fight scene between Superman and the first Nuclear Man was very good. He gives Superman a rough time for a little while, but Superman is able to dispose of him quickly.

This forces Lex Luthor to go back to the drawing board and create a new Nuclear Man. But rather than create him in the lab, Luthor creates the new one in the sun. The special effects were pretty lame, but for me, one of their brightest moments has to be the birth of Nuclear Man from the sun. When we first see his face there is fire in his eyes and it looks pretty cool. This is the new and improved Nuclear Man played by Mark Pillow. This is a handsome Nuclear Man with blonde hair and blue eyes. He is big and strong and all he wants to do is ""destroy Superman."" Nobody will ever know how good an actor Mark Pillow could've been. Nuclear Man's voice is dubbed by Gene Hackman's. The first voice that Nuclear Man hears when he arrives on earth is the voice of Lex Luthor. He ends up taking Luthor's voice. I could understand them dubbing Pillow because if you've ever heard his voice, he sounds too nice to be a big mean villain. But I don't know why they had to dub his voice with Gene Hackman's. Giving him the stupid roar didn't help either. Sometimes Mark Pillow overacts with his facial expressions. I swear, I think this is the new man of a thousand faces. He has how many different faces throughout the movie. You would think it was all different actors playing the part. Mark Pillow has some good moments, but some of the best scenes of Superman chasing Nuclear Man around the world ended up on the cutting room floor. They also cut out good scenes involving Lacy and Nuclear Man. These deleted scenes in the original cut explained what ""woman"" Nuclear Man was after and why. Cutting out all of those scenes that they did, destroyed any last chance they ever had of this being a good movie. The Lacy and Nuclear Man scenes also added a lot more to the character of Nuclear Man.

They didn't know what they were doing. If you're going to create your own Superman foe, make sure you do it right. Nuclear Man's costume is all right. But they had to go and give him these stupid long nails to attack Superman with. The point of giving him the nails was to pierce Superman's skin and give him radiation sickness. But nobody wants a villain with long radioactive nails.

Another thing they really screwed up with were the fight scenes between Superman and Nuclear Man. The fights just came off looking gay. They have their final fight on the moon and you're expecting this titanic struggle. What a let down. I'll admit, the fight has a few good moments, but whoever did the choreography is an idiot.

The greatest sin of this movie is what they did to Superman. Superman was completely ruined. I blame the producers, the director, the writers, and I'm sorry to say, I blame Christopher Reeve. The last time we saw Christopher Reeve in Superman III he looked great. He looked more muscular and he was better than ever. In Superman IV he is skinny and doesn't even come close to the way he looked in Superman III. If you don't want to see them turn Superman into a big sissy then stay away from this movie. In the fights with Nuclear Man, Superman fights like a girl and looks like the biggest wimp when he's moaning and yelling while Nuclear Man's murdering him. It's painful to watch the Man of Steel act this way. It's especially painful to watch Nuclear Man end the moon fight by hammering Superman into the ground. Did anybody realize how stupid that looked? Didn't Christopher Reeve realize how stupid he looked? Someone once said that the saddest thing in life is wasted talent. A great score here by Alexander Courage is wasted. Every actor was wasted. In John Cryer's case, he had no business in this movie. He ruined it with his stupid annoying act. In the Mark Pillow case, I'd have to say that his good looks were wasted. Mark Pillow was a handsome strapping young actor. I could've seen him playing He-Man or even Flash Gordon. He definitely had the look. As far as his acting, we will never know. This movie destroyed his career before it even began. I wish people could've shut down this project before it even began. They ruined a promising movie, they ruined the characters, and they ruined the series."

The problem with superman 4 is we haven't seen how it was or was not intended therefore the film doesn't make much sense but i personally think there is more standout points in this film than superman 3

(1)Clark and superman simultaneously having dates with Lacey and Lois a really well made scene.

(2)superman and nuclear man's fight around the world, silly but entertaining (3)russians in space singing my way, unrealistic but a well made scene.

there are a few more but the point i'm trying to make is superman 3 has one worthy scene and that's the junkyard fight between Clark and superman.

I truly believe when the deleted scenes come out this film will gain more respect but other than that i enjoyed it so balls to you all ha ha.

It is a melodrama, where good fights with evil. Sometimes some of us ask the question, what happens if you were superman and you had the choice of protecting or destroying the world.

2663,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"What the F-Word was this? This movie had some entertaining moments but that was like only 5% of the movie. I think this is the 2nd worst movie in the series but I'm not sure. I only saw the first hour of Superman III (I found it boring) so I don't know if it's the worst or 2nd worst. Anyway, this movie was so cheesy and barely faithful to the comics.

Nuclear Man?!?! What the F-word was that? The filmmakers of this movie were complete idiots! If they had a low budget then why didn't they just have the movie be about the romance between Lois and Clark? They could have also done the action sequences TV style because I doubt a Superman show will cost more then a million dollars to make.

What ruined this movie wasn't a bad script or a low budget but bad financial decisions. The filmmakers didn't use the $17 million wisely. What makes a good movie isn't the special effects. It's the story and the characters behind it. If I would have been 16 years older in 1986/7 I could have taken those $17 million and made a great movie!

I'm 22 now and I just watched it again (the DVD version). This movie is so ridiculous that it just annoys the heck out of me. I don't mind a silly movie now and then, I actually enjoyed the toxic avenger. This was because the movie knew it was ridiculous and didn't take itself seriously. This movie is a damned joke but it tries to be serious.

There are numerous problems in this movie, I'm no film maker and if I could notice these problems then so could the writers! First off is with Nuclear man saying ""Where is the girl?"" ? What is he talking about? Why does Lois lane not understand that Clark and Superman are the same person? why can't she tell that if clark is sick then superman is sick? Is this how the comic was? If so that is absolutely pathetic. Why is that lady (sorry I don't remember her on screen name offhand) taken into space? why is she not killed? there are so many problems with this.

Superman was such a great movie, and the film makers should be ashamed of themselves for ruining it all. I normally don't bother commenting on movies but I just had to come back and vent and tell you all how crappy this movie is. What a waste of time."

2667,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"That alternate title just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?

Superman has always been known for it's...unique approach in turning 'science' into a deus ex machinae to achieve anything the plot demands, and in Superman IV the film takes the same approach to morals and international politics. Instead of just foiling super villains and saving the world as usual, the clowns at Golan-Globus decided to use the comic medium as a diatribe against nuclear weapons...for in Superman IV it's not dastardly super villains or cunning plots that are the real danger...it's just nukes. Nukes, and Lex Luthor.

I shouldn't have to remind you that there's probably nobody on earth who isn't afraid of nuclear war. It's one of the scariest threats to modern civilisation. That said, the way this film simplifies the ideas of war and international relations is completely ridiculous. Forget that the threat of mutually assured destruction may have actually helped to prevent conventional wars, and forget that without nuclear arsenals many nations on this planet would probably be under serious threat, Superman IV takes the approach that things would just be peachy if all the nukes were just destroyed. Who's going to make sure nobody builds more, and who is going to stop nations like Israel from being utterly squashed after Superman takes all the nukes away? Who really cares? The movies approach to this very serious issue is completely absurd, and serves as a lesson on what NOT to do with your super hero movie. It's morals are as confused as the idiots who green lighted this idea.

With that out of the way, there's plenty of other reasons to hate this film. The writing is laughable, the characters (namely Lenny Luthor) are annoying, and the special effects are horrendous. Unlike the first films, Superman IV over uses the same practical and green screen effects countless times. The movie's 'dumb' in the sense that science, once again, does anything the script demands. Humans breathing in space and Superman moving the moon out of orbit to fight nuclear man are just a couple examples of how childish this film gets. I can buy Superman's 'mind erasing kiss' or even him flying back in time if it's only happening once and a while, but in Superman IV every time I hear Luthor talk about how the sun is just a 'big bomb' or anything like this I just want to cringe.

'Nuclear Man' seems like an interesting idea for a villain, but the way he's created and just about everything about him is hilariously bad. This villain looks like a surfer-dude in a bad, chopped up, power rangers costume. Thanks to bad special effects and terrible fighting choreography, the action sequences are about as boring as everything else about this film.

If you enjoyed Reeves' other Superman films but haven't seen this one yet, do yourself a favour and don't. It's shlock with very little redeeming value outside of it's own hilarious absurdity."

2670,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Superman III was a definite step down after the first two excellent S-films, but was still watchable. This movie, however, is a turkey from start to finish. No wonder it killed the franchise for 19 years ('til Bryan Singer came to the rescue), it really sucks, sucks, sucks.

There's only one thing I enjoyed, and that's the late, great Christopher Reeve, whose incarnation of the Man of Steel was once again pitch-perfect. Sadly, everything else is a 90-minute disaster: from the dire script (it almost screams: ""Hey, nuclear weapons are a bad thing, you know?"", and it has some awful dialogue, such as ""You know what we can do with Superman's hair?"" ""A flying wig?"") to the far from exciting SFX scenes (the same flying shot is reused at least four (!) times), The Quest for Peace is even worse than Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin, which at least tried to be decent (Schumacher himself admitted he wanted to make it less ""clownish"" than it turned out).

And let's not (?) forget the villains: Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) is sidelined in favor of his obnoxious nephew (Richard Pryor, who was the bad guy in Superman III, had a bit more charm), and the ""frightening"" Nuclear Man (voiced, God knows why, by Hackman) is probably the most throwaway movie character I've seen to date.

The premise was interesting, but not even Christopher Reeve could completely prevent this movie from crash-landing rather than flying. Apart from the leading man, Superman IV is about as interesting as a flying wig.

2673,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder and Gene Hackman return for the fourth and final Superman entry. Released in 1987 it's by no means a good film, it received universal hate upon release for cheap looking special effects, inconsistencies and plot holes. But over the years the film has gained cult status due to its cheesy dialogue, poor acting and far fetched plot making it enjoyable for all of the wrong reasons. It set the standard for bad superhero movies long before Batman & Robin was released.

Superman/Clark Kent still works for The Daily Planet newspaper but it has gone bankrupt and tabloid tycoon Petty White takes over. His seductive daughter becomes the new editor and takes a liking to the bumbling clumsy Clark Kent. Lois Lane gets jealous and it becomes a pointless love triangle which (like everything else) leads nowhere.

Anyway, Superman wants to rid the world of it's nuclear weapons and so every country (including Russia...) decide to help him gather all of these weapons so he can launch them into the sun. Meanwhile with the help of his annoying punk nephew, Lex Luther escapes prison and in the most far fetched plan you'll ever see, he creates his own super villain known as Nuclear Man, complete with spandex and an 80's mullet.

Logic is thrown out of the window with this one, Nuclear Man takes a human being into outer space and she survives just fine.... We know it's about an alien who can fly etc but a human in space... It's like a 3 year old wrote the script. There isn't an ounce of respect for the previous films or the comics, Superman IV feels like a spoof. The first two films had their goofy moments and they were never 100% grounded in reality but at least they made sense. This one is just a jumbled mess and it's like they made it up as they went along.

It would have been interesting to see Superman go up against these nuclear weapon obsessed countries. But instead they wanted to have multiple/unnecessary plot lines involving Lois Lane, Lex Luther and Nuclear Man all of which just ruin whatever potential the film ever had. There are a few tiny moments in the film which they could have further developed, but clearly the makers of this film were less concerned about quality and more concerned in milking this franchise for some easy money. Overall there is about 10 minutes of decent stuff in the movie, the rest is just a joke.

The film was doomed from day one, with budget cuts and numerous other production troubles making the final product laughably awful. Reeve and Kidder both did good jobs but it eventually ruined their careers. Gene Hackman clearly had the most fun, but most likely because he received a big pay cheque for his return. There were also so many scenes left on the cutting room floor and it's very noticeable, they basically released an incomplete film. It's stupid, illogical and just plain dumb."
2674,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"This is the movie that killed the Superman franchise until 2007. The acting was just awful and the effects were not really good. I also think that the main villain (Nuclear Man) was just a carbon copy of Superman, except less interesting. The music, however, is a saving grace for this film, so I'd recommend getting the soundtrack to this movie instead of watching the actual movie. 1"
2675,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Generally speaking, I have no fondness for this series of films. I think Reeves is okay as Superman (a character I have no fondness for), but the humour that permeates this series is asinine and childish. So while I would admit that this film is astonishingly shoddy and stupid compared to the previous entries (or at least the first two films), I can't say that I like it any less than any of the other films. In fact, I probably enjoyed it a bit more, but that's not really to the film's credit. A lot can be made of the fact that this film's budget was cut by about 2/3 due to Cannon's financial difficulties, but although that really shows in the film's insanely shoddy effects work and poor subbing of London for New York City, you can't really argue that this would be a good film if the effects were better. This is a film where Superman seems surprised that an elevator won't hold someone with strength similar to his. This is a film where Superman pushes the moon out of orbit with no repercussions. To be fair, it's also a film where the comedic elements are just as idiotic if not worse that the previous films. I grant all that ... but somehow the fact that this film is clearly junk makes it's stupidity less egregious than the stupidity of the earlier big budget studio films."
2676,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Dear Superman

Superman, Superman, how could you have sunk this low? Look mate, you had two brilliant films before. Superman, a huge achievement for all involved and the film that more or less kick started the superhero genre and Superman 2, a brilliant sequel that, while not a huge landmark like the first, can still stand on it's own in terms of story and acting.

But then it started falling apart.

When the Newmans were bought in to write Superman 3, that's when I started dreading the future of your franchise. They wanted to make your first movie campy and all that nonsense, but luckily they got kicked out. Sadly with Richard Donner truly out of the action, the Salkinds bought them in and Superman 3 became the film I was dreading it to be, a silly and stupid film with constant mugging from Richard Pryor and really terrible and dated gags.

Then they tried to give Supergirl a film of her own and it even that wasn't a hit with the critics.

Afterwards the Salkinds said ""Enough is enough"" and thus they sold you off to Cannon Films.

That's when the cracks was really starting to show.

Cannon are a rather cheap company and I knew a studio as cheap as Cannon certainly can't do justice to a superhero like you.

And they tried.... they really did...

and it was all for nothing.

I really hate to say this to ya Superman, but man oh man was your fourth film a huge disaster all round. In fact even more than the third one.

The plot sounded rather interesting, I mean you trying to stop a nuclear war from happening. That is a perfect concept for a fourth film... but then Nuclear Man walks in, and the only way from there is downhill.

Reeeaaalllyyy downhill.

Soon the film starts to really take a nose dive, everything from the dialogue to the incredibly cheesy and horrifically awful special effects start taking over.

We're not taking this seriously, we're laughing.

Laughing at the fact that the tornado scene is so laughably fake (fake as in it was all done on green screen.

Laughing at the fact that the final battle between you and Nuclear Man is really just an excuse to show off incredibly cartoony looking effects.

Laughing at the fact that Gene Hackman sounds unintentionally funny as Nuclear Man (played by a rather wooden looking Mark Pillow by the way).

But at the same time, we're thinking... why... why are we being subjected to torture like this? Look I'll give some of the actors credit, it was nice to see Gene Hackman back as Lex Luthor (even though the horrible dialogue didn't do much)and Christopher Reeve was alright as of course you, Superman.

But all of it still feels like it was done for nothing.

It feels like it was just done to keep your franchise alive and made for a quick penny so that Cannon can make more cheesy films.

Well the joke was on them... The film ended up bombing and it was panned by critics and fans alike.

Yet I still feel disappointed at you Superman, I feel disappointed that instead of a film that would rub away all those horrid memories of Superman 3, we instead got a film that made that look like Citizen Kane.

Honestly Superman, you're a super hero. And you should know better than to put your name on low budget guff like this? Well at least you got Man Of Steel afterwards though that still isn't saying much...

Here's hoping someone actually does you justice in the near future...

2680,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"There is a new nuclear arms race underway. Superman is forbidden to interfere with Earth's internal affairs. However a little boy's letter and taunting from the paper's owner David Warfield, Superman decides to make a declaration at the UN to destroy all of the world's nuclear weapons. Lacy Warfield (Mariel Hemingway) is the new woman at the paper who falls for Clark Kent. Meanwhile, nephew Lenny (Jon Cryer) helps spring Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) from prison work detail. Using a strand of Superman's hair, Lex Luthor creates Nuclear Man.

The movie is pretty boring and even more silly than all the others. There are a lot of problems with the ridiculous nature of this movie. Nephew Lenny is annoyingly silly. The premise of the world politics is stupid. The idea that Superman would reveal his identity and kiss it away just to ease his mind seems wrong. The effects may have actually gotten worst. However the biggest mistake is the idea that Superman would get rid of all the nuclear weapons.

During WWII, Superman never really battle the Nazis or the Japanese directly. It was a matter of Superman not be a God like figure to direct and interfere with mankind's wars. If Superman is to act like God, then the reaction from the earth's political and commercial powers have to act more realistically. This movie is too silly and simplistic dealing with world politics. The whole thing is a wrong idea."

Everything comes down to how rushed this film was. The special effects especially are the sort of last-minute 'at least it's something' crap the BBC used to put into Doctor Who. An inexcusably lame movie, and yes, it even reaches the level of awfulness of (dun dun DUNNN)....Batman & Robin!

2683,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"The release of Superman 4 had many negative repercussions on those involved. Firstly it bombed at the box office, making only 15 million of its already low 17 million budget back. Secondly, it is recognised as causing the death of the live action superman franchise until Bryan Singers Superman Returns in 2006. Christopher Reeve even recognised this film as the greatest failure of his career. Unfortunately all this is well founded as Superman 4 is amongst the worst superhero films due to the film getting almost everything wrong, short of having Super nipples. It tried to steer away from the comedy of the Lester Superman, but unfortunately had neither the drama nor action needed to do so.

Reeve had credit in this film as writing the story. However there is good reason why this was Reeves only film writing credit as with a story this poor there was never any chance of the film being a success. The films title is very literal in that Superman is on a quest for peace by attempting to get rid of all the nuclear weapons on earth by gathering them all up and hurling them in to the sun. Yes, the film uses the logic that nuclear weapons are the real cause of war and it has little to do with those who have the weapons.

Throughout it really tries to rub it in the viewers face that nuclear weapons are bad, as demonstrated by the villain named Nuclear Man. He's created by Luthor when he puts Supermans DNA to one of the missiles that Superman is hurling into the sun. Through this Luthor harnesses the sun's nuclear energy to create him and attempts to destroy Superman. Why the film didn't just use one of the many already existing villains in the Superman Roster like Bizarro is simply to reflect the message of nuclear weapons. The problem is by trying to simplify the concept of nuclear war, the message isn't being fed to us as much as it's being forced down our throats. Beyond this I suspect that in the 80's people already had the knowledge that nuclear weapons were dangerous without the guidance of Superman.

Mixed with this are a lot of pointless subplots which get no focus and many of which don't even get a conclusion. For example a girl named Lacy falls in love with Clark Kent for no other reason than the script demands it. A lot of time is devoted to antics such as Clark having to juggle a double date with both Lois and her by switching between Clark and Superman. But at the end of the film then it just feels like the film forgets entirely about the sub plot. Partly this could be because there are many scenes in the original that were either cut or unreleased due to budget being cut from 36 million dollars to 17 million just before filming was about to begin. This meant they could not film some scenes and others were unusable leading to a gaping number of plot holes in the films.

These budget cuts also led to the film having awful special effects which are comparable to the special effects of films like Shark Attack 3. This is why throughout the film you'll see the same shot of superman flying several times as a way of cutting costs. These terrible effects lead to what I would have to call one of the worst fights in a superhero film with a mixture of the worst effects and the worst fight choreography I've seen in film. All they seem to do is throw each other and fly away. Mixed with this are some ridiculously over the top moments such as Superman repairing the Great Wall of China or putting back the statue of liberty.

All of this goes together to making this into the worst Superman movie. I can see why this film ended the franchise for so long as failed in almost every way from the script filled with plot holes, awful special effects and the lack of humour making it the worst of the Superman franchise by a long shot. Saying that, this film does fall under the ""so bad it's funny"" category as it's funny to see just how many major plot holes there are ranging from a woman breathing in space to Superman going from near dead to one scene to alive and well in the next. But based on the political message this film was trying to be it was most certainly a failure."
2684,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Shall I recap Christopher Reeve's ""Superman"" franchise and the roller-coaster ride it was? It began with Superman in 1978, a strong, faithful adaptation of the comic book hero, bright and colorful, fun to watch, exciting in its action, and overall, a serviceable, genuinely entertaining piece of filmmaking. Its sequel was an equally strong film and, thanks to a refreshing but controversial change in directors, welcomed in a more satirical, comedic take on the comic-book character. It was fun and enchanting, if still accentuating the plastic kind-of qualities its predecessor had. By Superman III is when the character started taking a nosedive back to earth. The film lacked the great chemistry that was erected in the first two films, and focused predominately on a lame villain and an uninteresting character ironically played by the very interesting Richard Pryor.

And now we have Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, a cinematic disgrace to the character in every regard that could've been prevented if something called source-material-respect was implemented. The production history of Superman IV is heavily noted, with a lot of it being revealed in Reeve's post-paralysis autobiography Still Me. Reeve's participation was made possible by a convincing deal, but even in his heart he knew it wasn't right. The film was made by Canon Films who, at the time, had thirty movies in productions. Superman IV wasn't treated any different than other winners the company had set for release at the time like American Ninja 2: The Confrontation and Death Wish 4: The Crackdown. Enormous budget slashing, extreme cutbacks in nearly every film department, and the lack of interest in making a film that would rebound the mediocre response to Superman III all lead to the dismal product that is Superman IV.

You can almost see it in the cast's face that they have little enthusiasm for the material they're currently acting in. Even Reeve, whose face gleamed and personality erupted when he did his first big scene in the original film, has seemingly checked out of this franchise. Gene Hackman's return to the franchise, too, feels forced and looks as if he is totally uninteresting with what is happening, and additional talent from Margot Kidder, Jon Cryer, Sam Wanamaker, and the lovely, beautiful Mariel Hemingway is all wasted on a third-rate script.

The plot involves the ""Daily Planet"" newspaper being bought out by a journalist tycoon who favors sensationalistic titles over real journalism, leading to Clark Kent and Lois Lane's (Margot Kidder) job to be more about catering to the narrow-minded and stretching the truth rather than about honest journalism. Lacy (Mariel Hemingway), the tycoon's daughter, also takes a liking to Clark and his kind ways, as she desperately tries to throw herself onto him at every conceivable opportunity. And if that's not enough, Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) has returned, this time with his son Lenny (Jon Cryer). They are planning to create ""Nuclear Man,"" a man to battle Superman since they have failed numerous times on their own to destroy him.

With a larger budget and maybe a studio that took this material seriously and recognized they needed a colossal rebound after Superman III, these ideas could've worked just as well as in the first two films. But under the stiff, clearly rushed direction of Sidney J. Furie (who already had several films under his belt when this was released, so I'm sure circumstances and time constraints were mostly to blame) and the effortless special effects (again, likely caused by budget constraints), this is an incredibly paltry effort to revitalize a franchise.

Not to mention, a trilogy is understandable, but a fourth movie after the third film already seemed that the end was nigh? This seems like an outright joke in itself. Even the subtitle for the film, ""The Quest for Peace,"" leaves a person slightly confused. Wasn't that practically the ultimate goal in the last three films, whether it be peace and silence from Lex Luthor or Ross Webster's exhaustive computer hacking plan? Superman IV: A Quest for Peace is a rather disingenuous ending to a franchise many loved and many adored until lackluster decisions were made in the franchise's latter half. While the series had always maintained sort of this plastic quality I have been talking about, where characters do what is mostly expected of them and there's little deeper, below-the-surface mystery, the first two installments of the series were fun and quite exciting. What it evolved into was something no fan asked for and no fan deserve.

I laugh at how one of the opening scenes in the offices of the ""Daily Planet"" show the journalistic tycoon implementing controlling policies and budget cuts to make his vision of the newspaper. Something tells me that's how the production of the film went, with the tycoon being Canon Films and the angry staff the cast.

** (out of 4)

The death nail in the series finds Superman (Christopher Reeve) having to once again go up against Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) who has now wants to use Nuclear Man for his wild schemes. SUPERMAN IV turned out to be a huge bomb with critics, fans and the box office and it's really easy to see why. The first three movies were ""A"" productions and even though the third movie was awful, it at least was a ""Superman movie."" This film here is in no way, shape or form an ""A"" production and in fact it's closer to a ""C."" With that in mind, I think the film can be slightly entertaining as long as you don't take it too serious and are willing to laugh a bit. I say laugh because there's no question that Cannon slashed the budget as there are some pretty laughable effects throughout this thing. The ""C"" production also meant that this thing really did feel like those silly and campy sci-fi movies from the 1950s that people would be watching at a drive-in. I think on this level the movie can be somewhat entertaining but again, I realize that fans of the series don't want this type of movie and that's why they continue to hate it and probably just pretend that it was never made. The film's story is incredibly sloppy and bounces all over the place but I'm going to guess that this here is mainly due to thirty-plus minutes being cut off the running time. While that certainly hurt the story I must think that most viewers are happy they didn't have to sit through more than 90-minutes. The shorter running time certainly helps because the campy charm would be gone had this been longer. Reeve is still good in the lead roles but there's no question that everyone else seems bored. This includes Hackman who believe it or not was just coming off HOOSIERS. Jackie Cooper, Marc McClure and Margot Kidder are all just collecting paychecks but Mariel Hemingway does come off pretty good. Mark Pillow as Nuclear Man is a real hoot if you know what I mean. SUPERMAN IV will always be remembered as a complete and utter disaster but one really shouldn't take it too serious today."

YEEEEEEHAAAA!!! Even though he is dead, he will always be Superman!!!!!! See this movie, but skip Superman Returns!!! Watch Smallvill"
2688,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"When Superman IV comes to mind, one often thinks of the pain associated with its viewing. My friend and I, after being stranded on a remote island in Papua New Guinea decided to search for entertainment. Instead, we found the Superman Series.

To add a new effect we decided to view them in the opposite order (4,3,2,1). Strangely enough, special effects (which I will assume are supposed to evolve over time) improved (And Reeve's pot-belly appeared to vanish)! (By the way, to avoid embarrassment we watched them *very* late at night with curtains closed!)

One also finds themselves asking where are the ""actors"" now?

Perhaps Gene Hackman managed to resurrect his career after his potentially career-crippling experience in this movie. However, that big angry man that would occasionally growl (I am still debating with a friend whether the growling was also dubbed!), yes, the man they call Mark Pillow.

Where is Mark Pillow now? After looking at his ""impressive"" filmography (QFP and some TV series (Alaska Kid)) one does seem to believe that QFP was in fact Career-Crippling.

I have also had many a debate with a friend of mine regarding whether Pillow is constantly tormented by fellow workmates (don't try to tell me he is making his money by ""acting""), friends (if he still has any!) and family (I won't be that cruel!) with infamous lines such as ""Where is the woman!"" and ""If you don't tell me, I will hurt people!"" (I know I would!) It is often debated as to whether he was proud of his role in such a pitiful film. We believe that he was thrown out of a bar and landed at the feet of the casting crew who felt sorry for this drunken nobody. I will assume that these people (like Margot Kidder) have been committed.

Unfortunately Reeve dared fate with a second shot of the line ""Don't do it, the people."" after his ear-to-ear smile in Superman II (My friend and I believe that he was daring the phantom zone villains to beat up the innocent citizens of Metropolis with the dangerous irregular movement of a bus!), however while not smiling (this time anyway!) My friend and I were forced to declare the line as a ""Poor Reeve Call"". Lines that we have always found useful in day-to-day life include ""Excuse me, I think your sitting in my seat!"" (II) ,""Don't thank me, we're all part of the same team!"" (I),""I won't let you down again!"" (II), ""Stop, that's enough, that's enough. You win, I'll take you to her!"" (IV), ""Give it up you'll never find her"" (IV) and ""Father, I failed!"" (II). If by now you think that we are the ones that should be committed, you are obviously taking these comments far too seriously. While being very accurate, they are humourous as well!

So far we haven't really commented on perhaps the most atrocious element of the movie (the special effects)! Ok, I will even accept Lacy Warfield's survival in outer space (and yes, even falling relatively downward!) I know perfectly well that these things can't possibly happen (but then again, ""Superman"" couldn't possibly exist either (sorry!)) It is fiction. However, they could have at least made it look as if it were happening. Even the special effects in the first Superman Movie were better and it was made nearly 10 years ago! I may be picky, but I would expect the effects to at least be on par with those in Superman I.

My friend and I were thinking of a wonderful parallel universe where an alternate ending to the second movie involves Superman being humanized again at the end of the movie so that he can pursue his relationship with Lois. This universe would be spared of the peril of a fourth Superman movie.

However, perhaps it is advisable to look at why this ""movie"" was ever made. Reeve was not in the greatest financial position of his life and needed a movie that he would be guaranteed a lead role. Perhaps this was one of the infamous Tax write-off's. Needless to say, it was a mistake.

The story is predictable, sloppy, stupid, and unfocused, the performances are very one note, the script is poor, the editing/production is possibly the worst I've ever seen in a big budget film, as this looks anything but, and the fun that the first 2 Superman films had is completely gone. Even the campyness of the 3rd one is gone. This whole film is just depressing in every way, because it takes the series, and brings it to subterranean lows that not even the 3rd did, even for how bad that film was. Everything about this film is just lazy. Lazy, lazy, lazy. The editing is out of whack, the effects are complete and utter jokes, as they even look way worse than the ones in the early movies from the 70s, which there is no excuse for, since this film was made in the 1987. The writing has many plot holes and no cohesion, the premise is stupid with not a whole lot of thought, etc. My point is that this film is possibly one of, if not the laziest superhero film ever made, and the fact that it turned out this way, especially compared to the first 2 Superman films, it's severely depressing and disappointing, which is why I can't recommend this to anyone whatsoever, as there's literally nothing going for this film in any way, as it all just feels like a 2nd thought rather than an actual film. Hell, even new YouTubers could make a better film, because this is not only embarrassing, but also an insult to both Superman fans and film fans alike. Superman didn't deserve this. The more we can forget about this dumpster fire, the better."
2698,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"This film is a contender with Batman & Robin, claiming the title for the worst comic book movie of all time.

Batman & Robin arguably did significantly more damage to the source material, ruining the legacy of Batman for 8 years. However Batman was gradually redeemed with The Dark Knight trilogy, the Superman franchise has been unable to recover from all previous bad instalments. Superman Returns was abysmal, Man of Steel was incoherent and unstructured and from a recent viewing of Batman v Superman, I can honestly say it wasn't a particularly good film, inheriting the same problems that made Man of Steel dull.

The elaborate production phase and budget constraints are what made this movie to the gradual process of a colossal failure.

The first 3 films, with the third instalment being the film that took the franchise downhill, featured revolutionary visual effects that were outstanding for its time period.

This film however, the reduced budget is so evident with a notable deterioration in quality with the effects, as they look absolutely appalling. The same archive footage of Superman flying is recycled with every shot and flying sequences are in a straight line as opposed to the cinematography they were able to achieve in the first 3 films.

Christopher Reeve continues to give a good performance as Superman, arguably being the only positive aspect of the film.

With 40 minutes deleted from the theatrical version, the movie feels choppy, poorly edited and nonsensical.

There were attempts to make a good film, but the premise did not pay off, and the film is devoid of any redeeming qualities.

Final verdict, even rating it based on its genre, in general it is one of the worst movies ever made."
2699,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Not even Ed Wood himself could have made a more amateuristic film than what Superman 4 turned out to be. Worst bluescreen effects ever: superman just seems like a blueish/greenish/reddish cardboard cutout sliding over the screen sideways much like the Terry Gilliam cutouts from Monty Python but here it's not meant to be funny (I think). Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is nothing more then a clownesque nobody assisted by his 'slick' greaser highschool nephew. Superman's nemesis 'Nuclear Man' -created from superman's DNA- turns out to be a 80s hair-metal Neanderthal in spandex who's lines of dialogue consist mainly of 'Arrrghh'. Compared to modern day superman this one looks like a pyjama wearing nerd with his over-sized red underwear on the outside with matching plastic boots. I'm sure he wouldn't draw any attention in a gay bar. They always say films are made in the cutting room but here the editor must have shaken his head and thought there was nothing to be saved. Don't get me started on the plot: christopher reeve co-wrote the story...probably when he was high on LSD or something. (Spoiler) At a certain point in the film superman gets rid of all the nukes in the world by plucking them out of the sky, gathering them in a giant ball and swinging them into the sun. Also people can breathe in space. This film is just a disaster of epic proportions and you really have to see it to believe it. I'm sure this is used in Film Schools around the world as reference material on how NOT to make a film."
2700,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"I loved the first two Superman films, the third was okay, but this one was awful. Other than Christopher Reeve's assured lead performance and the rousing score, there is very little I can say that is good about this film. The special effects are incredibly cheesy and dated. The story is hackneyed, unoriginal and pretty predictable. The script is lamentable. The direction is stodgy. The pacing is uneven- there are parts that are rushed and there are parts that drag. The other acting is not even worth mentioning, as much as I love Gene Hackman I just don't buy the possibility he thought this film had a good script. Overall, awful and while not the worst sequel ever made it is a disgrace. 1/10 Bethany"
2701,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"As much as I hate to go with popular consensus, I must admit that it is quite accurate in the case of this film... it blows. It blows with the power of its title character's super-breath. Oh golly me, how it blows. Nuclear Man looks and sounds(apart from the fact that his lines being spoken in Gene Hackman's voice, for no apparent reason) like something out of one of the Conan movies. Superman defies logic and science(yes, I know... but he does it more in this one than in the two preceding it put together), as does the film. And worst is the moralizing. The plot is quite poor. This is most definitely a sequel... and one that shows signs of a series that should have had the plug pulled several films back(right after the first, some would say). The writing displays a general lack of creativity. Luthor is brought back... slightly louder and less charismatic this time. We are introduced to Lenny, portrayed by Jon Cryer. I, for one, did *not* need to see this man playing a teenager. He's much funnier in Hot Shots and on Two and a Half Men. And what was with the complete and utter waste of Jim Broadbent? The man hardly utters a word in this film, and his screen-time is so small, he could have been an extra. I haven't seen much of him, but even from that(BlackAdder and Moulin Rouge), I would gladly sign(or perhaps even start) a petition to legally change his name to Funny Man. The humor takes the leap out of the campiness of the previous effort, but the plunge in writing and directing keeps the audience consistently underwhelmed. The film is hardly dramatic... the action sequences dire and unengaging. The writing scrapes bottom so hard that it goes right through, with no stop in sight. How many different similarly-abled beings is Supes gonna fight before actually facing a villain we *know*(from the comics), other than Luthor? I realize that Lex is his arch-nemesis, but it's as if these writers have gone to extreme measures just to avoid doing what is arguably easy(simply hand-picking a villain already known), but also what the real fans want. How many decades of history does this character have? It shouldn't be difficult to find someone suitable. The writers of the old series of Batman films managed... four times, no less. Granted, they also managed to screw up basically every film but the first, but they did have the assistance of Joel Schumacher, a director without any sense of making a comic book come to life as a film. Back to this failure, sorry, film... the effects are worse than ever before. The budget is quite clearly to blame. The attempts at drama or comedy are usually cringe-worthy... as is the nature and heavy-handed delivery of the two messages. It just winds up sounding incredibly preachy. Yes, we get it... nuclear power is dangerous, newspapers should be about news, not making money. Now stop trying to be morally superior... that, incidentally, is *not* what movies are about. The acting is fine. All in all, this just really doesn't have anything to offer. If you want food for thought on either message, read up on it or watch a documentary about it. If you want to see a good(or even passable) superhero film, look elsewhere. Consult the fan-base for more info on which of the previous films in this series is better, or go with another hero(or check out Singer's vision, and hope that he gets to keep making them as long as he does as good as he has with the first). I recommend this to fans of admittedly bad movies, as that is the only way this has any value at all, and as a lesson in what *not* to do when making a good film, for directors-to-be. 1/10"

2704,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"I'm actually one of the very few that likes Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. I thought it was a good movie. In this movie, Superman has another great challenge, and to save the world yet again. So, I can't understand how you can not like this fourth movie because it's different compared to the previous three movies - the story is different that is. At least this Superman movie, tries to be different, and that's where I think ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" succeeded, otherwise it would've been flat and boring. People are forgetting that this movie still has 'Lex Luthor' who happens to be Superman's greatest enemy. I don't know what else this movie could've done just so you can like it. Basically, the battle still resumes between these two 'popular' characters just like what you saw in the first movie. It's like a continuation from the first movie: Superman. I like this movie, and it's a Superman movie I could watch again. It's an eighties movie by the way, and I like movies from the eighties. I like the title for this movie, and think it's a wonderful title to call it. I think all the Superman movies are fine and successful movies. Usually, the third and fourth movies tend to get a lot of criticism, and this Superman movie was no different. I think that's unfair because Superman IV is a true superhero movie. It's rare to see a good fourth movie, and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace was one of them. Just be sure to add it to your watchlist!"

2707,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"It's a little amazing, really, how quickly the original Superman franchise eroded into bad comedy. This being the ground floor of that descent, it bears little similarity to the original film beyond several key casting choices and a spit curl. Christopher Reeve returns as the title character, of course, with Margot Kidder suffering an expanded role and Gene Hackman back from a one-film exile to ham it up once again as a clueless, underwhelming Lex Luthor. Filling the Richard Pryor ""why?!"" role from the previous film is Jon Cryer, better known as Duckie in Pretty in Pink, who plays some sort of pointless, meandering male twist on the Valley Girl stereotype that was rolling through culture at the time. I'm still not entirely sure why he was elbowed into the plot. This isn't aggressively bad like Superman III, it's just hopelessly inept. In fact, the core of the story has a lot of potential: Superman, inspired by a letter from a young boy, destroys the world's nuclear armaments and discovers that some problems can't be solved quite so easily. It sputters and fails right on the launchpad, though, and soon falls back on a muscle-flexing brawl with some generic evil menace to solve the problem. Its grasp on physics, and reality as a whole, is so loose it's almost adorable. I'd pat my four-year-old son on the head and smile if he suggested we move the moon around to keep the sun out of his eyes, but for this film that's a legitimate solution. To say its answers make any sense would be an insult to sense itself. The whole thing plays like an easy answer to a complex problem, from the story to the editing to the acting to the effects work. These older superhero movies don't hold up to the rigors of time as a whole, but Superman IV looks particularly bad in a modern setting. Even the hero's indistinguishable costume seems cut-rate and fake, like they'd forgotten to commission a wardrobe department until the night before production. Head-shakingly pointless and dull, this film only seems to exist to kill time. Which, thankfully, it doesn't demand in great quantities. While the original cut came in at over two hours, some greedy last-minute cuts trimmed it down to a slim ninety minutes. Why the late edits? To ensure a few more showings each day at theaters nationwide. Of course."
2708,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"This movie is an insult and disrespectful to Superman, to the fans, it's even disrespectful to Superman III, which wasn't that good of a movie to begin with, but even that was better than this Z-grade, nonsensical, juvenile drivel.

The plot ridiculously has Superman ridding the world of all nuclear weapons, while Lex Luthor is cooking up a Nuclear Man (who looks like the singer in some awful hair metal band) of his own to take down Superman once and for all. We learn, in the course of the film, that Nuclear Man has no power at all when the sun doesn't shine on him, so, he obviously doesn't come across as being very intimidating, unless one gets radiation poisoning from him. Or, scratched by his manicured talons.

The effects are rock bottom, bottom of the barrel, and they are reused multiple times throughout, which only reiterates their ineptitude. Colour shifts, and changes in tone only make the poor film stock (due to the film's slashed budget) even more obvious. The photography itself is flat, centred, and dull, it never rises above looking like a television commercial.

A problem this series had was coming up with worthwhile villains. Lex Luthor, and especially General Zod, were wonderful, worthy opponents in the first two films. In part 3, we had Robert Vaughn and Richard Pryor fumbling about. Here in part 4, we have a reject from a bad hair metal band, with Gene Hackman's dubbed voice, fumbling through poorly choreographed fight scenes with Superman.

I give this film a 2/ 10, just for the fact that Christopher Reeve still puts in a good performance, unlike some other actors who, by the fourth go round, would just be phoning it in."
2709,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"After going through the painful territory for ""Superman III,"" I have now gone myself to the stupidity territory of ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace."" This is the end of the franchise, and for Christopher Reeve for playing both Clark Kent and Superman. The plot of the movie is pretty much lame, because it is really about Superman who is going to rigged the world of all nuclear weapons while Lex Luthor escapes from prison with the help of his nephew as they create their own Superman as he was born from the sun with all the nuclear solar powers to become Nuclear Man or something like that. Sorry for not giving you much detail about the plot, because the movie itself actually goes completely nowhere. Its amazing how this franchise went completely downhill, where you start off something amazing to a travesty. If this movie didn't killed the franchise, then the Salkinds didn't have to fire Richard Donner for ""Superman II"" so that he can finish the movie 100 percent, and have Tom Mankiewicz (on IMDb trivia for ""Superman III"") direct ""Superman III;"" if it stays like, then it would be either a great trilogy or make four or five ""Superman"" movies so that this franchise would stay strong, and very much ended on a satisfactory note. But no, Donner got fired so the Salkinds would bring Richard Lester to direct ""Superman II"" (which I still enjoy, but Donner's cut is better) and ""Superman III"" so they would go into camp factor, and have Richard Pryor in the third movie. Now, for the fourth movie, the Salkinds gave up and sold it to Golan-Globus' Cannon Films to produce the movie, which it definitely makes matters worse. The special effects in this movie are just awful. How awful? The budget was originally 36 million dollars, but as Cannon Films was into financial problems, they slashed the budget to 17 million dollars as they kept reusing effects like Superman flying right into the camera and have it poorly composite. I wish if they hadn't slashed its original budget, so that effects wouldn't look like this. The only good effect is the same footage from the first three movies that ends with Superman flying into space, and smiles at the camera. You really if the effects for this movie are just as good as the first three, and maybe keep getting better at it. The movie is directed by Sidney J. Furie, who is a director that I am not familiar with has not done a great job on making this movie, and I wonder if he wasn't satisfied the way how the movie is presented; if he admitted it, then I would forgive him. The story itself isn't that well told, but it comes to a shocked that Christopher Reeve co-wrote the screenplay. I remember watching videos of him on YouTube, where he said that he wasn't satisfied with the third one so he can make a ""Superman"" movie that he want to see so it can be as good as the first two, and pretty much forget about three. I'll give him credit for that for at least trying to come up with a better story, but sadly it was not well executed as Reeve himself isn't satisfied with this movie as he hoped for the way he envisioned. The action isn't really that good either, and I really don't have much comment on the music so its really just there. This movie is filled with a bunch of errors like the child actor that plays Jeremy disappears out of nowhere, Nuclear Man kidnaps Lacy as he takes her to space as she can breath perfectly fine, Superman moving the moon, fixing the great wall of China and Superman getting sick as we never see how is able to recover, when he has that darn green crystal in his hands. Wow, movie! I mean, wow! Now, after my issues with this movie, is there anything that I liked? I hate to admit, but the movie is filled with great actors who very much wasted on such great talents. Most of the actors and actresses gave their all, but pretty much ended up by going into a bad direction. I don't have much comments on either Mariel Hemingway or Mark Pillow as Lacy and Nuclear Man, because they're just there and don't care whether they did good or bad. However, it is nice to see Gene Hackman returning as Lex Luthor as he did his best with a bad script, but don't think he did good as the voice of Nuclear Man which I find it pretty silly. I really don't care for his nephew as he is played by Jon Cryer. Margot Kidder does her best to as Lois Lane, and I really wish if there was more romance between her character and Superman. Oh, I forgot to mention that she does remember that Superman's real name is Kal-El as that erased memory kissed didn't help from the second one, and now Superman erases her memories again. Well, gee, that was pretty pointless. As for Christopher Reeve, it is sad that this was the last time that we ever seen him to play both Clark Kent and Superman, until his passing on October 10, 2004; he still is giving a great performance and whenever he is on screen you know that he will always be Superman as his legacy will live on forever. We surely do miss him, and I know many fans will still remember him. Even me. With that said, ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" hits the nail of the coffin for killing the franchise as he returns to the big screen in ""Superman Return,"" then he disappears, and reappears again in ""Man of Steel."" I give this movie a 2 out of 10."
2710,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"This fourth instalment sees the return of Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor, as well as the introduction of ""evil fingernails"" and the most jejune stupidity in the franchise.

There is a certain amount of enjoyment to be gained from watching Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman and Margot Kidder go about their business like this was one of the first two movies, but at the end of the day the film's a total non-event. There's almost nothing worthwhile here.

The awareness of the cast about just how poor the film was is both a good and bad thing. On the one hand, a little self-deprication and honesty goes a long way to redemption, but on the other, if they knew how bad it was, why commit to the starring roles? They weren't contractually obligated to do so (like Avengers actors are nowadays).

The notion of Superman bringing about an end to nuclear war was kind of neat, so that initial premise had some promise, but unfortunately the whole thing takes a back seat and everything in the front row is just... Just awful, let's be honest.

2711,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"'Superman I - IV' is a classic example of how movies lose quality with each sequel (I voted 9-7-6-4 for them). After the first movie established a monumental myth, including the tragedy of Superman losing his fathers (both of them), the second and third movie were passable continuations with a lot of action. Jolly good fun, but not outstanding in any way. By the time of the fourth movie, there are still the same actors, but along the way all the depth was lost. Superman tries to hide that with a pretentious 'destroy all nukes' mission imposed on him by a little boy. Hackman, who was a brilliant villain still in part 2, audaciously trying to use the 3 powerful criminals from outer space for his own purposes, is now just clowning around with Nuclear Man, basically keeping up the 'I want to kill Superman' routine due to lack of other hobbies. Nuclear Man is one of the most ridiculous baddies one could possibly imagine, acting like the four year old son of Hercules in kindergarten. I enjoyed watching part I-III again after many years, but part IV really is a disaster, no wonder they stopped making further (cinema) sequels for the rest of the cent"
2712,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"In THE QUEST FOR PEACE, Superman finds exactly that. Following this box office bomb, the series would go on to rest in embarrassed peace until Bryan Singer would come along with a spiked baseball bat to beat this dead horse back to life in 2006. This movie is bad. Real bad. It's a miracle we still enjoy comic book movies after SUPERMAN IV did everything in its power to scare us away from them. It's hard to believe Tim Burton would come along a mere two years later and amaze movie crowds with BATMAN. Even Richard Lester, the man who pit Superman against Richard Pryor and a ""computer"", would have nothing to do with this movie and the task of directing was turned over to a man named Sidney J. Furie, whose only other directing effort I'm familiar with is that lame soccer movie LADYBUGS with Rodney Dangerfield. SUPERMAN IV is a terrifying blend of poor special effects, hokey messages, and Jon Cryer as the most aggravating 80's stereotype to ever poison the big screen. This all about the nuclear crisis (or as Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor would call it""nucular"") facing the world during the Cold War with all the major world superpowers on the brink of nuclear annihilation. A young boy's heartfelt letter convinces Superman to break his vow of non- involvement in the fate of Earth by disposing of all the world's nuclear weapons. Once that's out of the way, we get an hour of Superman doing battle with Lex Luthor's latest scheme: Nuclear Man, a walking atomic weapon with a period-appropriate mullet.

There's just so much wrong with this movie. I don't even know where to start. It's just bafflingly stupid. It can't all be bad, thoughright? There's got to be some good stuff here. Let's start with that: Gene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor and Mariel Hemingway is decently attractive as Clark Kent's new shoehorned-in love interest, Lacy Warfield. Well, now that we've got that out of the way

One thing that really annoyed me here is the same problem I've had with previous Superman movies. We get one plot for the first portion of the movie (in this case, the first 35 minutes is all about Superman ridding the world of nuclear missiles) and then the movie just decides to shift gears for the rest of the show (battling Nuclear Man). The movie has no real flow whatsoever. The whole nuclear disarmament angle, while relevant to the period in which the movie was released, is just too cheesy to be taken seriously. A wide-eyed youngster is asked how he would solve the world's nuclear threat: ""Well, gee golly, I'd just ask Superman to do it."" If that's not enough cheese for you, we have Jon Cryer (pre-TV fame) as Lex Luthor's nephew Lenny. Luthor has a history of surrounding himself with fools in the movies and Lenny is the most offensively bad of them all. With his bizarre 80's style and his surfer speech, you wish Superman would grab him by the collar, fly him out into space, and leave him on an asteroid somewhere. If that seems harsh, don't worry: you find out near the end of the movie that anyone, not just Superman, can survive the cold, airless, empty vacuum of space. Isn't that right, screenwriters Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal? I've accepted some pretty far-out concepts from the previous Superman movies, but that was only because they were fun movies (well, not so much with SUPERMAN III). This film doesn't get that liberty because it's nowhere near the level of its predecessors.

There's just so much stupid about this movie that it'd take more than this comment section to go over it all. Thankfully, it's been covered ad nauseum in countless online reviews that tear this movie to shreds. Despite being released almost ten years after the original film, SUPERMAN IV actually has worse special effects than when it started. They're just horrible. The flying effects are the worst of the series. There's also the matter of the rehashed elements from previous films: Lois and Superman go on yet another ""romantic"" flight over Metropolis (except the background images never quite match the flight movement of the two and it looks terrible) and we get another amnesia kiss to wipe Lois's memory of the event.

The audience isn't nearly as lucky. We're left with the memory of Nuclear Man: a creature mutated by Lex Luthor from a strand of Superman's hair, some fabric, one of those magical computers, and the sun. Nuclear Man generates an internal heat at the temperature of the sun without cooking those around him, goes inert when not in direct sunlight, and has radioactive fingernails. Still, I suppose it's better than Richard Pryor's supercomputer in SUPERMAN III. But not by much. The last 45 minutes or so of the movie are Superman and Nuclear Man battling back and forth a bit while Nuclear Man flies around the world creating messes for Superman to clean up with more arbitrarily created superpowers (i.e. his new Super-Rebuild-Walls-from-Scratch-o-Vision). It's all just embarrassing. And that's coming from me, a viewer. I can't imagine having my name forever seared into the end credits and having to admit I helped create it.

SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE is a comedy. It doesn't know it, but it is. It's laughably stupid with a plot the barely holds together and enough cheese to feed an entire third world nation. I enjoyed the first two Christopher Reeve movies, and I even found some high points in the much-maligned third film. But this movie has no real redeeming qualities and, worst of all, ended the Christopher Reeve/Superman saga on it's lowest note ever."
2713,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Just as fans argue which is the better film, Part I or II, so fans equally debate which is the worst, Parts III or IV? Well-intentioned but poorly produced and shockingly inept plot about Superman ridding the world of Nuclear missiles, only to be undermined by the return of Lex Luthor, escaped from prison, and then creating nuclear man to once again conquer the world. This plot is so silly, with ridiculous science and visible wires on the actors, that it's a wonder the creators learned nothing from the lessons of Part III, even if it did make money (sigh!). This film flopped badly though, ending the series on a sour note, though again a nice idea at its center.

Christopher Reeve still delivers a sincere performance however; shame he didn't get the chance to redeem things with a properly prepared Part "
2714,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"The tag-line of this movie should be ""You will believe that a man can hang on wires in front of unconvincing blue screen effects."". The special effects are the least of this movie's problems though. The script is awful. It's a provocative premise, having Superman deal with a real world threat like nuclear proliferation, but here it's merely a bit of speechifying and a plot device to create our villain. At least Reeve and Hackman retain their dignity, and lend a little to this otherwise dreadful film, by giving game performances.

2716,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"The first two Superman films were critical successes, then Superman III disappointed fans, and then came this entry, ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" or as I like to call it, ""The Quest for Failure""! Amid infuriated fans, this film killed the franchise and I can see the reason why.

There are two things that try to save the movie but couldn't and it's that the cast from the original two films return along with some new additions (which is a good thing since they got rid of Richard Pryor from Superman III) and the music score from Alexander Courage (with the main theme from John Williams) is rousing. Besides, even those two saving graces couldn't save the stupidity that this movie had.

The story is half thrown together by denying the physics of science and has a lot of plot holes. The script is beyond inconsistent, it drags itself in most of the scenes in it's 90 minute, the directing from Sidney J. Furie is not only terrible, but lacks a lot of focus, and the special effects are beyond dated (with the worst blue screen effects and the shots of Superman flying through the camera being repeated in almost the entire film).

Superman IV: The Quest for Peace is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's so terrible it makes Batman & Robin look like a masterpiece in comparison. To fans who grew up with the franchise, avoid this abomination at all costs if you know what's good for you and watch the first two Superman films."
2717,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Even Gene Hackman and Christopher Reeve couldn't salvage this disaster. And the sad part it, it didn't have to be this bad. If they could have portrayed Nuclear Man differently, including their use of Gene Hackman to voice him, if the plot holes were sufficiently plugged up, if the flying effects (at times) were not worse than the 50's television show and if the stupidity of having such things as Lacy Warfield (Mariel Hemingway) exist in outer-space without a space suit (and other such nonsense), it might not have been that bad. There were parts that I actually thought were decent. And there were good flying effects at times (although they were few and far between). I actually enjoyed seeing Gene Hackman portray lex Luthor again and he seemed like he was enjoying himself in spite of things. You know the story: Golan-Globus Productions were nearly bankrupt and had too many irons in the fire (at the time Golan and Globus had over 30 films in production, were cash-strapped and they gave Superman IV received no special consideration). They slashed the budget for this movie from $50 million (US) to $17 million, and it managed to gross a meager $15 million at the box office. It killed the franchise for nearly 20 years. On second thought... It did have to be this bad. There was nothing that could salvage this mess."

Furie,"It's hard to believe, but in the eight years I have been watching ""Smallville"", this is the first full-length alternative version of the Superman story I have seen. I saw the third movie many, many years ago and enjoyed it a lot, mainly because of Richard Pryor. ""Lois and Clark"" was my favorite version of the story, and then there were some George Reeves reruns many years ago. I've never seen the first two movies. When they were on broadcast TV, I just wasn't interested. The first was on Ion, but I don't have it.

This movie, though, was the first one where I saw nerdy, clumsy Clark and really enjoyed what I saw. The third movie had the character but I didn't pay attention.

I especially liked Clark's efforts to keep Lois and Lacy from finding out he was Superman. I didn't care for this Lois, and her near-absence from the third movie was a positive. I wanted Clark to have a relationship with the beautiful Lacy, who sort of reminded me of Erica Durance.

It was interesting to see Clark given advice by a female voice. I'm used to his mentor being male. These scenes where he learns the great truths he must know are always enjoyable.

Gene Hackman made a great cartoonish Lex. I'm used to the darker, complicated portrayal by the excellent Michael Rosenbaum, but I normally prefer comedy. I can't say one is better than the other. And with the always enjoyable buffoon Jon Cryer as his sidekick, that's even better.

I've missed seeing the morally upright hero in the blue and red suit who is known by all, and I enjoyed seeing him use his powers, even if some of the special effects were obviously just that. Right now, I mostly see a flawed hero in training who moves too fast to be seen, but whose deeds are known. There's something more satisfying about seeing this perfect person who, for reasons no one will explain, no one recognizes as looking just like Clark Kent if Clark just took off those glasses.

I was disappointed with the portrayal of Perry White. I've seen much better acting.

No, it wasn't one of the greatest movies of all time, and it can't compare to what I've heard about the first two. It was just a fun and silly adventure, one where no one gets hurt except Superman (who can heal himself), so the whole family can watch. Maybe some younger kids shouldn't see some of the implied violence, but even with incidents where people would die in real life, they come out all right, as if Tom Bergeron were narrating."
2719,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Superman is my all-time favourite film and I immensely love Superman II. Superman III had its faults, but it was still enjoyable up to some extent. Unfortunately, this isn't the case with the fourth (and what we thought was the final) in the Superman series. First off, the ""special"" effects. One word: FAKE! We have Warner Bros. to thank for that for selling the rights to Cannon Films who, instead of using the $40 million Warner Bros. gave them to produce the film, used only $17 million and used the rest of the money on their other projects. Next up we have (drumroll)... the numerous plot holes e.g. people being able to breathe in space without space suits. Did I miss something here? Thirdly, the editing. Oh my, that poor, poor editing. The cuts were so noticeable, I was wondering if I was watching a Daytime TV edit of a Horror movie. And finally, the acting. Wow. It was like something out of a school play (and a bad one at that). But, I suppose the actors did the best they could with the (truly atrocious) script.

Superman IV doesn't even classify as a ""so bad, it's good"" movie. At least not when you compare it to the highly superior first two.

Some people have said that this movie is worse than Batman & Robin. Trust me, it is not. Not even close. However, both Superman IV and Batman & Robin are the worst of their series."
2720,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Every single other comment for this movie has not given it anything more than a 3 out of 10. I can only assume that they watched the movie believing it would be any good.

Superman movies have always been campy (yes, even *before* that lovable hack Richard Lester threw his half-baked lot into Superman II), but people thought Superman III was the ultimate, the final, the only possible depth to which the Superman series could sink. It was unabashedly a comedy and it performed poorly, so the Salkinds left the series forever and handed the producing duties over to Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus, two wild and crazy guys from Israel who *just* wanted to illegally funnel funds from Superman IV and cut corners everywhere. They did so, and the film bombed at the box office.

But it shouldn't have. The problem wasn't at all with the script, the acting or the movie itself; the problem was with the people who saw it. They were expecting a serious Superman movie. What they got was the most unintentionally hilarious movies of all time, an understated classic of bad cinema.

There is only one way to watch this movie, and that is to watch it with friends and mock it endlessly. Despite the large-ish budget and well-known character, Superman IV would do very well as an episode of Mystery Science Theatre 3000 (a 90s TV show dedicated to mocking B-movies). It has everything: bad eighties hairstyles, completely illogical plot lines and more failed special effects than an episode of the old Doctor Who. Strings are easily visible, a police car magically appears out of thin air, Superman is referred to as ""The Dude of Steel"" and people seem to be oddly capable of breathing in space, not to mention the dialogue: ""You know what I can do with a single strand of Superman's hair?"" ""You can make a toupee that flies!"" If you're not as immature nor as odd as I am, the effect may be replicated by making a drinking game of the movie or inhaling illicit substances, but how it happens is not important. What is important is that this movie should not be condemned as a horrible serious movie, but be respected as a fantastic, if unintentional, comedy.

See you in twenty, indeed."

2722,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"The years have conferred cruel nicknames upon it, Superman 4 F*ck's sake!, Superman IV: Rest In Peace, The one I didn't see and so on. In fact part 3's Annette O'Toole (Lana Lang) delivered its most devastating critique, remarking simply ""they made a forth one?"" Yes, these cine-bullies have rounded on the third Super-sequel like a whore to a City Trader's wallet and though the criticism should be immense, it isn't the horror some would tell you it isthough it's pretty close.

So how did a movie that made $350M in domestic adjusted dollars do a Jaws, and spawn such a miserable third sequel? What was it about the year 1987, did someone kill all the best filmmakers that year? The Quest for Peace plays like a bloody knife in your husband's raincoat, suggesting we should be looking for bodies rather than apportioning blame. Blame is the game though so here we go – Having killed the secret of their success by firing Richard Donner and his script doctor Tom Mankewitcz, the Salkinds, those Icelandic imbeciles with next to no understanding of what made Superman work, had cocked up Superman III by turning it into a camp escapade with Richard Lester throwing the custard pies. Imagining that the audience had lost interest in Supes rather than hating what they'd done to him in the 1983 instalment, they soiled the suite further by inflicting Supergirl on an audience still licking its wounds. When that failed the sultans of Santa Clause: the Movie decided to get out of the super-business and sold the rights to Golan and Golbus, Hollywood moguls from, er, Israel, with all the creative zeal of a lobotomised organutang.

1987 was a big year for the GG's as no-one referred to them on account of Golbus' rumoured resemblance to a horse. They were also making Masters of the Universe, another 'hot property' but the gruesome twosome were spreading themselves a little thin – in short, the money wasn't quite pouring in as they might like. With other projects requiring life support, these geniuses took much of the $40M Warners had given them for Superman and spent iton something else!!! Possibly on air fares to Israel. The logic is obvious – why would you need to spend money on a Superman movie? Its total lack of visual effects or international locations would make it ripe for downsizing. Thus as the Reeve was lured back in exchange for amongst other things, story input, the budget was halved and the result speaks for itself – on a shoestring? The crew on this one couldn't afford stringor shoes.

The total and soul destroying shame of Superman IV is that it could and should have been a wonderful swansong for Reeve in the title role. His nuclear disarmament theme, much derided, was in fact an honourable stab at giving the man of steel a meaty, real world problem to solve as well as returning the series to the more serious tone of the first two films. Unfortunately the script has no intention of doing serious, generally veering from infantile to ridiculous. It's the kind of screenplay that says 'we're not getting paid enough here' (which they probably weren't) but worse, 'we don't give a stuff'. But poor though it is – little wit or character development to be found here, what really kills Superman IV is the aforementioned budget. Even at a truncated 86 minutes it's embarrassing to watch a movie which feels so amateurishly produced and poorly made. The visual effects are, for the most part, atrocious. They would have dated instantly; in fact much of the work could be bettered today using the most basic effects software available. Unfair perhaps but given the quality of SFX at this time, the lack of money spent on them is unforgivable. If anything is going to pull you out of a movie, no matter how good the story or likable the characters, its seeing the strings – in this case literally. Reeve as ever is impossible to dislike and makes the worst of it bearable but the sheer thriftiness of it, Milton Keanes doubling for New York for example (!), is enough to incite you to crush Golan's Globus' with extreme prejudice. From the rubble there's also a fairly decent score by John Williams and Star Trek's Alexander Courage but even there it sounds as though the budget didn't stretch to an orchestra, the music having a tinny, synthesised quality to it in places. Brutalised in production, murdered in the editing suite with over 40 minutes excised (but in sympathy to the editor he must have had plenty of unusable footage, much of which he'd reluctantly have to have locked into the final cut) this last Superman (not counting Returns as it doesn't count this) is an abject lesson in poor production management and how to slay a cash cow with utter unmitigated contempt. Christ, Reeve probably laughed harder on the day he was paralysed."

2724,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Pathetic addition to the ""Superman"" series has The Man of Steel (Christopher Reeves) pitted against adversary Lex Luther (Gene Hackman), who is in cahoots with multi-millionaire Richard Pryor.

How Pryor achieves his wealth is interesting and was copied in ""Office Space"" (even referenced by that movie, too). But it's ridiculous. He takes the half-pennies from co-workers' accounts and adds them together. How does he become a millionaire overnight? It would take a heck of a lot of half pennies to become a millionaire.

The end is just plain ridiculous, where they are all in a cave and there's this sort of robotic humanoid attacking everyone. What in the world were they thinking?

Sort of a guilty pleasure. It is actually the ""Superman"" movie I think of the most when I hear the word. Why? I don't know. I guess because it's so bad.

0.5/5 stars."
2725,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Richard Donner's original Superman stands as one of the great movies of all time. His care for the legacy of Superman, as well as his superior skills as a filmmaker, made it the definitive portrayal of the Man of Steel, and that holds true to this day.

Superman II, while lacking Donner's special touch from the original, was a worthy successor, and delivered a solid action/adventure movie with excellent performances by all involved, particularly Reeve and Hackman.

Superman III started to go downhill, but not irrevocably so. It was a great deal more hokey than the first two, clearly intended to be more of a comedy than anything else. But it's watchable.

But Superman IV was where they lost it. This was the Superman series' attempt to make a relevant social point about nuclear weapons. Not the best way to build a Superman story. Add to that the fact that the budget was slashed, the writers sub-par, the special effects lacking, and the movie chopped down from its original running time to barely 90 minutes, leave this film to stand as a dismal failure. It's sad that what began as such a great series would end this way.

Save yourself the misery. Watch Superman and Superman II, even III if you feel like a watered-down version. But leave this one alone."
2726,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Simply put that is how I describe this one. None of the Supermans are really great, but they are ok. This one is just awful...I mean where do I begin. I might as well start with the budget...It just had to be extremely low. His flying looked worse in this than in the first one. Then there is the acting Reeve goes beyond mediocre in this one...here he sucks. I am guessing it was the director's job that made him tolerable in the first three. Not that anyone does a good job in this one including Gene Hackman who is also awful and just why did the feel the need to have Jon Cryer play his nephew? Then the scientific errors. Somehow a strand of Superman's hair can hold up all this weight...I think it was a ton, but Lex Luthor cuts it with bolt cutters. Nuclear man takes a girl into space where there is plenty of air for her to breath apparently. And speaking of the villan, did they try to make him as lame as possible or what. This of course has to do with the plot, a whole movie devoted to telling us a nuclear war would be bad...Duh! If Reeve thought this movie was going to cause world leaders to say ""Gee, we shouldn't start a war and maybe we should disarm"", then he was fooling himself."
2727,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"As weak & as lame as ""Superman III"" was, it at least had a few redeeming qualities. The ONLY one I can think of for this embarrassment is the scene where Clark has to entertain Lacy, & Superman has to entertain Lois at exactly the same time in 2 different places/rooms. I squirmed as I sat through this - how low the Superman movie franchise had sunk in 10 years! ""Superman I"" sparkled with suspense, humor, drama and romantic chemistry. ""Supe IV"" has a California surfer blonde Nuclear Man who talks in Incredible Hulk-speak and manages to carry Mariel Hemingway into space where she continues to breathe normally! This piece of dreck is a low point in the careers of Sam Wanamaker (father of actress Zoe Wanamaker, BTW), Gene Hackman & Jackie Cooper. Chris Reeve tries but the writers and director failed this one. Poor Margot Kidder looks haggard in this too. Skip it, skip it, skip it & just watch ""Superman I"" & """
2728,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Let's just face it. The first two films were good, the third was very awkward and this film is a time-waster! Hehe. Talk about an enemy named Nuclear Man (I thought he should be called ""Zuperman"" simply because hiss N looked like a Z), who's simply a rip-off of Superman...just on the nuclear side that is. The story is the most pathetic Superman story of all...in any form no less. Some scenes are totally unrealistic like when Nuclear Man had a woman hostage and went to outer space...you should see how unrealistic it is. Gene Hackman's back but his performance is nowhere near his past Superman performance...too bad because his presence went to waste with this blasted film. Christopher Reeve had his last Superman performance which is good because in this film he lost some of his Superman appeal and act and his age back then was related to that.

Superman IV came out at a time when nuclear arms where a big issue (well...it still is today) and having Superman rid the world of them seemed like an interesting idea and a chance to show off Superman as a role model for the world. Well, seeing Superman gather those nukes and toss them at the sun was simply...very awkward and corny.

It's just too bad that the Superman series of movies ended very badly with this blasted film. Heck, this one should have never been made."
2729,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Despite what critics say, this movie is amazing in it's own wright. The special effects were quite good for the time it was made, the acting was amazing even if this sequel is just a tie-in to the original story. The characters like Superman and Nuclear Man are not disappointing at all. The movie although offers a little story it's good because if you're an all action film fan than this film is for you since most of the story is about Superman fighting Nuclearman in several climatic battles across the world and even on the moon. It's a shame that not to many think so and besides this Superman film is an environmental film ifyou consider all of the nuclear talk here. We need to consider that this movie was produced in 1987. Cristopher Reever was an outstandingactor. There are only a few flaws on this film but trust me that you will love this mov"
2730,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,I would rather watch Superman IV than any of the previous Sueperman movies.

2732,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"This is by far the worst of the superman series. No surprise to me that the late Christopher Reeve had something to do with the writing of the scripts. Now what line springs to mind, ah yes,

""What's he going to say?"" ""Something wonderful""

Pure cheese.

Very strange that superman suddenley becomes a tad stronger than in the second installment of the series, where he struggles to stop a bus full of people thrown at him by Ursa and Nom under the guidance of General Zod. Then, in this final trash film, he is able with ease to move a planet. Highly unrealistic.

The most amusing part of this flick for me is when Nuclear man is using Superman as a nail, knocking him into a planet. He takes a big swing and then gently taps Reeve. It's so fake it's funny.

Don't bother watching, hiring/renting or buying this film, it's garbage. Watch Superman II instead if you really must see a flapping cape. Enjoy some classic quotes from II........

""Throw it!, Throw iiiiiiitttttttttt!!!!!"" ""Luthor you poisonous snake!"" ""So you are a General, and who is your superior....?"" ""Come, come and kneel before Zod............ZOD!!!!!!!"" ""In return for your obedience, you will enjoy my generous protection, in other words, you will be allowed to live"" ""These humans are beginning to bore me""

Rating for Superman IV, 2/10. Awful"
2733,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"The only way I can psychologically process the experience of watching this film is to assume it is an intentional comedy designed to subversively mock the superhero genre. Otherwise, I would have to rank it as one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Superman III was an unmitigated disaster but still had some decent moments. It's successor, however, is completely and utterly irredeemable. The storyline is recycled and lethargic, and you can feel the lack of interest from the cast. Even at just 90 minutes long, the film is painfully slow-moving and feels like its never going to end.

The coup de grace of Superman IV is the introduction of Nuclear Man, who is, by some distance, the single worst villain I have ever seen in a movie. I simply don't have words to describe how awful this character is. Mark Pillow is either a comic genius or literally the worst actor of all-time.

Christopher Reeve is a wonderful actor and one of my personal heroes. His book 'Still Me' is one of the most powerful things I have ever read and I have given copies to almost everyone I know. It pains me deeply to award one of his films the dreaded 1/10 but I have no choice. This movie is truly horrific and a blight on the reputation of everyone involved."

Reeve himself wrote some of this film, and I think he gave it a really good message. I particularly love the scene where he says: ""There will be peace when the people of the world want it so badly, their governments will have no choice but to give it to them."" Superman IV did not have a large budget like the previous films, because of this I know what ways it suffered. But it inspired so many comic book stuff, like Doomsday and Cat Grant were inspired from Nuclear Man and Lacy Warfield. Which those actors don't deserve the hate they get for this film. I thought Mariel Hemingway did a lovely job as Lacy, and despite his cheesy role, Mark Pillow did what he could. I think this movie deserves a second chance because it's message was about peace, which is what modern Superman movies like Man of Steel ignore greatly.

2736,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"My film knowledge is clearly wanting, because I found out only yesterday that Milton Keynes doubled Metropolis during the making of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace - a fact which alone sums up the scope, ambition and grandeur of Sidney J Furies's nail in the Man of Steel's cinematic coffin for almost twenty years. Looking back, it's so apparent what different an age these Superman movies lived in, a 1980's where comic-book movies were seen as disposable fluff, certainly not keeping up with the tide of seminal graphic novels that only now is cinema truly catching up with. The Quest for Peace is very close to being an outright abomination, saved primarily by the goodwill radiating from the whole thing... saved not enough, mind you, to prevent rendering it as possibly the worst comic-book movie ever made, or certainly close to its pure nadir.

You could cite a million problems. Story. Script. Production. Casting. It's pretty much got the lot, which in itself is an achievement. The low budget means Furie has to shoot in wholly unrepresentative locations that are so far away from the classy glamour of the first movie it's unreal, while ironically given Hollywood was on the verge of CGI breakthroughs around this time, the effects are the shoddiest of all four movies; the story starts in earnest fashion, with the interesting notion of Superman being called upon to interject in a nuclear arms race (though given, at this point, America & Russia were practically bowling buddies, it's not exactly razor sharp political commentary) utterly shattered when it descends (after a bizarre sequence where Supes throws ALL the nukes INTO THE SUN - surely that's a terrible idea, scientists?) into yet another dumb Lex Luthor farce of a plan and introduces the most laughable antagonist in comic-book history... NUCLEAR MAN! Oooooh! Run from his poodle perm! Hide from the daft lycra suit somehow created by the mad Frankenstein physics that creates him! Duck when he swipes you with his long, trimmed nails! I genuinely am not exaggerating about this guy... seriously, if he'd been accompanied throughout by Pepsi & Shirley, they would not have seemed out of place. In a way, he's brilliant for comedy - you try and fathom WHY he picks up the Statue of Liberty and decides to lob it down on a New York street. Good luck with that. He's just... amazingly awful, and once he turns up it just descends into the worst battle for supremacy you're ever likely to see on film. Poor Gene Hackman - he should have carved a comic-book legacy as Luthor, sadly he may just be remembered for all the wrong reasons when it comes to these films... I just hope he got paid well, frankly.

Is it all bad? Well... yes. Almost. I feel most sorry for Christopher Reeve - what a way to exit his most iconic role, though admittedly he didn't necessarily know it'd be his last, but he must have known this was garbage. He does gamely well, in fairness, as charming and effortless as ever, and way above the material. Ditto Margot Kidder, reinstated properly here as Lois Lane, who gives possibly her sleekest & most assured performance in the role, again despite working with detritus (and having to share too much screen time with Mariel Hemingway's wet lettuce love rival). Those two just--just--make watching this worthwhile but only, truly, if you are a Superman completest. No, really.

Superman IV has a lot to answer for, really. It--and the preceeding movie--meant very few movie makers in Hollywood took the superhero genre seriously for a long, long time and though Tim Burton's Batman would level the playing field a little more soon after, The Quest for Peace truly showed how not to treat Superman or his genre."
2737,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Oh the potential this movie had, Christopher Reeve and the original cast from the first two films were truly behind this one but alas that could not make up for the lack of budget and shoddy script. Poor visual effects aside, this movie is just hastily cobbled together from a few half-baked ideas that aren't fully realised, with the character motivations and the way certain plot points come to fruition not making a lick of sense.

I understand that 45 or so minutes of this film were left on the cutting room floor, but having both watched the deleted scenes and read the original script for the movie, I have to say that even if all of the footage had been left in this movie would still have been a mess. I appreciate the idea of a scenario where an omnipotent superhero is put against a real world crisis but the way it plays out here doesn't do the premise justice, I would have much preferred it if the world authorities were resistant to Superman's plan for worldwide disarmament and were inadvertently united in the cause to prevent his interference, but instead there is no challenge, no moral panic, no humanity, it is just bear bones bad writing. Even so I have to say that Christopher Reeve's decision to focus the film on an overt anti-nuclear war message was a mistake from the start, not to mention it instantly dates the film and makes it come across as pretentious and trying too hard to educate rather than entertain.

Yes the effects are terrible, yes the lack of money shows in almost every frame, yes the film would have been better if certain scenes were left in, but despite this every problem with the film boils down to the script. A competent writer would adapt a script to better suit a reduced budget, and while it may make sense to keep the original scale of the story if the budget was cut shortly before filming but in this case the budget was cut over a year before production started! And when that happens it is the responsibility of the writer to change the story so that the scale is less important, but rather the characters and morals are the focus. This happened with Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, the budget was severely reduced and so the director rewrote it to focus more on the characters and less on the action, and that film turned out wonderfully, why didn't that happen here?! The film is a sad end to an otherwise classic (or half classic) movie saga and unfortunately leaves Christopher Reeve, the definitive man of steel, in a bad light. While the film perhaps tops Superman III for good intentions and being a guilty pleasure, it's far from the film it should have been."

Here's whats wrong with this movie: The special effects budget was cut in half right before filming, that's why the effects look so terrible. The movie was way too short, it feels very hasty, especially when you compare it to the first two films. I've seen the deleted scenes and i really have to say it's a good thing they were left out. Nuclear Man #1 is horrible. He's not menacing or scary, he looks stupid. Like a failed incarnation of some silly Frankenstein film.

One of the biggest mistakes i have ever seen in a movie is one made in this film. Nuclear man 2 takes Lacy (a human with no superpowers whatsoever) into space. She doesn't freeze, hell she even breathes!! I don't know what the director was thinking.. This is careless film-making.

But let's not just focus on the negative side. The movie also has a few good things. The original cast returned (Margot Kidder as Lois, Jackie Cooper as Perry White, Gene Hackman once again as Lex Luthor and of course, our hero, Christopher Reeve returning as Superman). The fight scenes were very cool but looked bad because of the horrible special effects. If you can ignore the bad stuff i mentioned above, it's still a fun film to watch.

2743,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"(This review contains potential spoilers)

I'm probably being generous with 3 stars, but for the first 45 minutes or so, Superman IV isn't a bad little film. Granted, it's instantly obvious the budget is a fraction of what had been used for the first 3 films, and Luthor's nephew is a terrible 80s teen ""dude!"" stereotype. But the opening sequences with Clark visiting the old farm in Smallville and the return of Margot Kidder's Lois Lane are both welcome. Mariel Hemingway provides a sexy third side to the film's romantic triangle ... but it could be argued a film like this didn't need that.

It had been 10 years since the first Superman was filmed, and this gives the regular actors added depth as they played their familiar roles. Gene Hackman is an exception, playing Luthor a bit too low key for the character's own good.

At about the 45-50 minutes mark, things start to collapse as the close-to-an-hour's worth of deleted scenes begin to take their toll on the film -- for example, suddenly Clark looks all grey-haired and dying with no real reason given. And while the battle between Superman and Nuclear Man is clearly inspired by the comic books -- and would have worked well in the comics -- in live action, it just comes off as silly. And when the filmmakers abandon any pretense to reality (by, among other things, having a human character survive hanging around in the vacuum of space) the film just falls apart.

The film is worth seeing, though, for the byplay between Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder. It's a pity the opportunity was lost in Superman III to expand on this more when Kidder was written out of the film.

But, as the fourth entry in a franchise that began with the spectacular Superman I and Superman II, this film is an extreme disappointment -- though, at the same time, it's one of those films that seems ripe for the remastering/directors edition/upgrading routine that has been done with other films."

I came onto the IMDb to see how high they were rated (I wanted to know more about them, as they no longer sold them in Australia, and I had pretty much no way of watching them)... Superman III = 4.5 Superman IV: The Quest For Peace = 3.2 For a couple of months, I kind of avoided seeing them, afraid that they would ruin the first two movies. One night I got home from work to see that Superman III was on television. I stepped in just as Clark opened the door of his car, and hit Richard Pryor, and he gasped in pain. I saw the rest of the movie and thought it OKAY. Months and months later (Up until the point when I couldn't remember a single word of Superman III), I bought the Ultmate Superman Collection, and sat down and watched Superman III. It got pretty boring. I just zoned out of the movie. Then I saw Superman IV. I thought it was a lot more enjoyable (Probably because Margot Kidder had a lot more screen time). So All in all, an Okay movie to watch, if you have nothing to do."
2745,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"This was just another Golan-globus bomb, in which they expected to make money off the name, similar to the godfather 3 or straight to DVD movies. It was depressing to know that this was the final harrah of Christopher reeve, especially when superman has a gut the size of a 6 month pregnant woman. There were so many scenes where platforms, wires, rewinding of film, and frame skipping were clearly evident. The first scene for example, when the cosmonaut got his head chopped off and in the next scene his head was back in place. The mistakes of this movie were unforgivable.It was just a horrible movie in which they didn't care how crappy they made it, just as long as they did and people saw it because of the superman pedigree. It was so horribly bad and had so many plot holes it resembled swiss cheese.

With that being said, this is what made it entertaining. No matter how much this movie raises my ire I have to admit it was wonderfully entertaining and i recommend renting the movie so you can find all of the errors, similar to a where's waldo book (replacing waldo with errors). Even after saying that positive remark, i am led to assume this was the most poorly made superhero film, but at the same time manages to be one of the most entertaining."
2746,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"I must admit that when I first saw Superman IV at the box office I knew that it would flop! It was so badly made by the Cannon group and Sydney Furie! Even with the low budget it had to work with, I think a good director could have pulled off a more successful film! We have three ""Superman saves Lois Lane"" scenes, in the first film we have the helicopter scene which was edge of your seat suspense! and an awesome special effects scene in the pre-CGI era. The Eiffel tower scene in Superman II, almost as awesome! another edge of your seat suspensor, then we come to Superman IV, the Subway train scene, which I almost fell asleep through! come on Sydney! what were you thinking? If Richard Donner had made this film, it would have soared! The subway scene could have been suspenseful even on the low budget the crew was given to work with!

So, you ask, why are you giving this film four out of ten stars? Because of the story, the performances of Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman and the over all fact that I was glad to see another Superman Movie! The ideas that went into this movie were great! Superman tries to save humanity from itself! Perry White looses the Daily Planet to a competitor! Superman fights a villain created from his own DNA! If the filmmakers had anywhere near the passion for this material that went into the first two films then it would have been a very entertaining Superman movie! and it may have been the first Superman film to break 200 Million at the Box Office! But, it was not to be! I was hoping that there would be five Christopher Reeve Superman films and this film, sealed that fate! I have seen the new Brandon Routh Superman and I feel that the new filmmakers have a passion for the material, but the films story is weak! The special effects were top-notch and the cast is great! But I think the story ideas for Superman IV are actually better then the story ideas that went into Superman Returns! (However, it's good to see a Superman film in the hot 100 selling films of all time again). I would like to get all the film shot for Superman IV and find the special effects team for Superman Returns and get them to take out the bad special effects and re-do the Special Effects through CGI! How much would this cost anyway?"
2747,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"once again the acting is superb....well think good something was good about this film.

1st the good news....there is a wonderful scene where superman and Clark Kent are on a double date together with Lois lane and Meriel Hemingway. that scene is classic, smart, funny, cleverly written and very well done. - (again I cant praise the acting in these movies enough-even part 4 has good acting in it) now the bad news.... the Clark Kent/superman double date scene is the hightlight of the entire movie.

Nuclear man is so awful that its funny.

I could not believe how poor the special effect were on this film. This is the only one of the 4 Superman movies where you can actually see his cables holding him up.

the only thing worst than the special effects was the laughable script. C'mon...I could not believe my eyes when superman and Nuclear man were carrying Mariel Hemmingway around in outer space with no space suit on her (and yet she is okay)...not to mention the cartoonish action sequences (like the one where Superman stops a volcano by cutting a mountain in half with his X-ray/heat vision and plugs the top half of the mountain into volcano's mouth....which in reality would have only created more volcanic back pressure and would have only caused a much larger more violent eruption)

how did this franchise get here. the first 2 films were standard setters..true classics in their own time, and although the 3rd film isn't in the same class as the first 2, the 3rd film is still very good..but Superman 4 leaves you scratching you head and asking yourself WHAT HAPPENED?"

Christopher Reeves mentioned in his auto biography that he was basically forced to do this film in order to do ""Somewhere in Time"". With this in mind, he still displayed a performance that rivaled the previous. Good job Mr. Reeves.

2753,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Many people have written about this movie and how bad it is. Well, it is bad. Can't deny it. Some of the effects are among the worst ever displayed in a major motion picture. The script is chopped up so bad that some scenes wind up being incoherent. One saving grace is the sincerity of the performances. Christopher Reeve is still a believable Superman/Clark Kent, while Gene Hackman makes a pleasing return to the series as Lex Luthor. It should either have just dealt with nuclear arms or the solar powered villain, not both. The zany subplot with Mariel Hemingway falling for Clark is mildly amusing.

I have heard/read a great deal concerning cut scenes and a grossly cut budget. Why did they do that to Superman? Didn't the producers know that fans wanted to see a worthy movie, not a cheap imitation?

The real problem was that the Salkinds left after #3, leaving the filmmakers with cheap producers, and not choosing a better director than Sydney J. Furie.

At least #3 had entertaining elements, even if it did throw out the Lois Lane character and any trace of the previous two movies. I liked the sweetness of the Smallville scenes and the humor provided by Richard Pryor; I even liked some of the special effects sequences. But #4 is virtually a child's wind-up toy. Reeve had good intentions with his input as co-writer and 2nd unit director, I'm sure. He remains true to character.

It should have been better. * *"
2754,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"This is definitely not what the Superman Saga should be remembered for. However, it is a decent idea and it does bring back Hackman as Lex Luther which is good to see. However, his sidekick, Otisburg, must have read the script and opted not to audition!

The movie is inspired by Iran-Contra (Oliver North 80s) and the Cold War of the middle and late 80s. Nuclear war is something that Superman opposes and he decides to rid the planet of all nuclear warheads. As he is tossing the missiles into the sun like they are toothpicks, Luther has been secretely formulating a plan to use Superman's own DNA against him. He steals a piece of Superman's hair (over his ears) from a museum and makes a potion that will react with solar energy to form Nuclear Man. The concoction is fastened to a missile and when Superman throws it into the sun, Nuclear Man pops out and heads over to the moon (where Superman happens to be) and they have a brief battle.

Nuclear Man, controlled by Luther, decides to hit up earth and goes to visit his master. Luther can control Nuclear Man by shutting the curtains and blocking the sun. He gets his energy from the sun, not from eating hot dogs and Doritos in a bowl like humans.

Anyways, they have their usual battles and Superman almost is carved to death, but returns and throws Nuclear Man into a nuclear power plant which gives unlimited energy for 1,000 years. Great ending!

This is all, I seriously doubt there will be another sequel given Superman's (Reeve's) current condition of handicapped circus sideshow!"
2755,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"There are often movies that come along in which you think, ""yes, it was bad and it could have been better"". The thing with Superman IV : The Quest For Peace, is that never a truer word has been said. It COULD be better, and iam sure that in its entirety with the previously unseen footage in the 134 minute cut of the movie, it would be good. As it is i must judge a patchwork movie. That is the main problem, the movie is badly operated on. Forget the special effects, they work nicely and arent as bad as people and critics will have you believe, we have seen worse. The direction by Sidney J Furie and presumably Christopher Reeve is at best good. The acting by the regulars and fun performances from John Cryer as Lex's nephew and Mariel Hemingway as Lacey Warfield [the love interest] are acceptable [certainly no worse than in any other sci=fi/action movie. And the plot, which has Superman fending off Nuclear arms from the worlds powers and defeating Luthors evil Nuclearman in the process is quite an exciting tale. The problem is that the movie is cut to ribbons. We see about fifteen minutes of what looks like Gene Hackmans best performance as Lex Luther, and Christopher Reeve's character comes over as vey wooden because we miss out alot of his characters development. As an 89 minute movie, Superman : The Quest For Peace is very lukewarm. As a 134minute movie, it looks to be alot better. Those of you who can get the extended version released, you know who you are. Help us, help yourself, get it released."

The legend of Superman is so eminently campy that filmmakers have sullied his reputation with Superman III and Superman IV: The Quest For Peace. But this one takes the cake. Originally, the storyline was promising. It had to do with Supes' inner turmoil. ""Should I play God?"" he thought. ""Should I destroy all the nukes?"" An awry experiment by Luthor makes his mind up.

Who really expects a deep, significant story out of this franchise, anyway? It's just brain candy for a couple hours' mindless enjoyment. Don't expect anything more than that, and you won't be disappoin"
2759,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"After reading the other 'reader reviews' I am hesitant to praise the movie. Though they have a point when going on about film's inconsistencies. I mean at the end when Supes pushes the moon(and forgets to push it back!) in order to block out the sun's rays. Duh! After all, he has had all Kryton's knowledge instilled into him before he was four and at 18 had the total accumulation of all knowledge spanning the 28 known galaxies presented to him and was asked to study and learn them. So why not use a blanket instead? The special effects were shoddy and at times the script was corny. ""I'm always here for you, you know that and you'll do the right thing no matter what, you always have!"" But I found this film not as bad as others have made out. It's a very light film and at the end of the day it is science fiction. In the comic world, Lex Luthor had a brain transplant and came back as his own son! Why not let outlandish plots such as these live in the movies too? If you guys are so into realism then simply look out of the window. See, that's boring! Reeve is great as usual though I couldn't help noticing his Kent character has changed a little. Gone is the higher voice and akwardness. He and Lois have developed a bond and have more respect for each other. Can you see her asking if there's anything she can do to help in the first 2 movies? The characters relationship have(I feel) unintentionally matured and in Superman II Clark was supposed to be very jealous of Superman and when Lois mentioned that 'when a girl's seen Superman in action, Niagra Falls kinda leaves you cold' to where clark gets jealous and Lois apologises and admits she has a one track mind. Now in this movie Lois actually tells Clark that she loves him which isn't what Clark really wants to hear. By the way, how old is Jimmy Olsen supposed to be? He looks a bit to old to be a cub photographer. The music was good, if a little weak. Alexander Courage did a better job than Ken Thorne, who in his defense, had a small orchestra to play with. I especially liked the music where Supes takes Lois out for a fly. In surroundasound this sounds marvellous and the quality is better than in the 1st 2 superman movies(typical). It is too obvious that there were loads of of scenes cut out and the movie is severely handicapped as a result. If the original cut was boring - so what? at least it would of made more sense. Wouldn't that of looked better and gotton more respect?

Personally I thought superman III was more boring than this, that film had to much footage of the bad guys and was to heavy handed. This film tried harder and had more heart. Leonard Maltin wrote that the sincere performances helped and I agree. Mark Pillow and the guy who plays Lenny fail of course. The casting associate obviously picked the wrong guy's name out of the hat but I guess that's life. I can think of lots of films worse than this which include just about every other film Gonan-Globus produced. My conclusion? A simple harmless film which should keep the kids quiet for 90 minutes, and for the Adults? Well isn't that obvious? Go watch the 1st movie instead."
2760,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"This sequel was uncalled for. Christopher Reeve's writing contribution was okay, but the movie only gets a 3.9 on a scale of 1 to 10. I'm sure the writers meant well, but didn't expect such a negative backlashing.

I won't go into detail on this except, I can watch it, but it's also a disgrace to the talents of Reeve, Hackman, Cooper, McClure, And Kidder from the other Familiar ""Warner Brothers"" Superman Movie Actors.

The Nuclearman? C'mon. That is completely below stupid.

Now the fight scene. The Nuclear Man takes a woman into space who not only is immune to the intense cold, no air, and no pressure of space but is also so heavy she falls in space. Now for another lesson in astronomy. Did you know it only takes a few seconds to get to the moon. Yep, and no matter where you land on the moon you will invariably land on or near the spot where Neal Armstrong landed. A"
2762,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Sometimes sequels are made for the sake of making money (see ""Rush Hour 2"").

Sometimes sequels are made for the sake of continuing a worthy story (see ""Lord of the Rings""). And sometimes, sequels are made for no discernible reason. Such is the case with ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.""

So much talent is wasted here. Jon Cryer. Mariel Hemingway. Sam Wanamaker. Even Jackie Cooper's Perry White is simply a caricature of a caricature. Margot Kidder's Lois Lane apparently had all of her brain cells removed by Superman's kiss at the end of Superman II. The movie is garbled.

The plot is unclear. The characters lack motivation. And I picked all of this up at age 13. I remember riding home from the theater, having seen Superman IV while my parents saw something else. And boy, did I wish I'd gone with them once the movie was over, and I told them so.

One last note: a lot of users have bashed the character of Nuclear Man. They were right to do so; he's an awful character with an awful haircut (Crowded House called: they want their bassist's hair back!). But even though the character was terrible, Mark Pillow's portrayal of him was somehow even worse. If you look up Mark Pillow on the IMDb, you'll notice that he has had a total of two other roles. That's two too many. Your average used-car salesman could have done a better job. And probably would have had better hair, too!"
2763,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" (1987), this is the last ""Superman"" movie with the one and only, true Man of Steel; Christopher Reeve. He is one of the biggest elements that make this movie worth watching. This movie is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. It's still much better than any live-action DC film made after ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy! This movie has a great story, great acting, great sets/locations, and a great soundtrack. The special effects are not too bad, but they don't go without their flaws in this movie of course. Probably the most glaring one is the same shot of Superman flying toward the camera over and over and over again. They use the same flying shot 11 times throughout this whole movie! Now, it honestly doesn't anger me like it does for most people lacking a sense of humor. I actually laugh at it and it's fun to watch! The only other glaring special effect issue are the wire shots, which don't really appear until the second half of the movie. Other than that, the special effects are actually decent and utilized to the max given the small budget! The story is interesting, Superman trying to rid the world of nuclear weapons and preventing our global destruction. There are a few subplots, but they all add up and tie the movie together in the end. The acting is great, again, especially from Christopher Reeve. He gives it his all and even with a small budget, you will still believe that a man can fly! Margot Kidder is stellar as Lois Lane as usual, Marc McClure is great as Jimmy Olsen, Jackie Cooper is perfect as Perry White, and Gene Hackman is once again the best Lex Luthor. There are a few new characters introduced into this franchise, and they all do an excellent job as well! Mark Pillow is great as Nuclear Man, Jon Cryer is hilarious as Lenny Luthor, Sam Wanamaker is excellent as David Warfield, and Mariel Hemingway is funny and charming as Lacy Warfield. All of the actors do a great job! They realize that a low budget can't replace the quality of acting. The sets/locations are nice, they look like part of a comic book, which is a neat change of pace in this series. It really gives the movie a nice atmosphere! The soundtrack is excellent. It takes the original brilliant film score of the one and only John Williams, and gives it a different level of depth. Alexander Courage did a fantastic job adapting John Williams' original ""Superman"" musical score! Overall, this movie is a lot of fun and is definitely worth watching. I give it 4 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 8 out of 10 stars. Remember, just because a movie has a low budget, does not mean it can't be entertaining. ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" is entertaining in every sense of the word, and always will be. To end my review, let us have a moment of silence for the late, but always phenomenal, Christopher Reeve. He has really helped bring this character to life, Christopher Reeve is Superman and he will always be Superman. Rest in Peace, Christopher Reeve. You will always be the one, and the only, true Man of Steel."

2765,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"Sadly, the entire Christopher Reeve Superman franchise has dated very badly since first release. I never saw the movies as a kid, so thus have no nostalgic affections for them; I watched them all recently, and was shocked by the naivety of the plotting and inexcusably poor special effects work.

I know the first two films are regarded by some as classics, but I find them twee and dated. The third film is indescribably bad, and indeed the nadir of the series; THE QUEST FOR PEACE is thankfully the final of the Superman movies, and the good news is that it's not as bad as the last one. It's still incredibly lame, though, and I have to say that I only found it mildly entertaining because I treated it as a comedy throughout.

The first half is dull, saddled with Reeve's grating slapstick as Clark Kent and Margot Kidder's own brand of screechy histrionics as Lois Lane. Gene Hackman is back and slumming it, although he's in it so infrequently that he doesn't fare as badly as the rest of the actors.

The second half is where it gets slightly amusing, presenting large scenes of mindless destruction perpetrated by the movie's erstwhile villain, Nuclear Man (possibly the cheesiest, campest villain in film history). Cue the Great Wall of China exploding and a mini disaster scenario involving an erupting volcano. The effects are awful, but it's all quite funny, although nobody in their right mind could describe this as a ""good"" film. Add in some heavy-handed lefty politicising (of the same variety as Seagal's ON DEADLY GROUND) and you have a film that's memorable for all the wrong reasons."

However, there is something about it that made it a little more endearing than the previous 3. Maybe it was just the fact that I wasn't expecting anything great with it. Superman seems to be so jovial throughout the whole movie, except when he get's the beat down from Radiation Man, or whatever they coined the other guy. It kinda seemed like Christopher Reeve and Margaret Kidder were just having fun with this one.

Truthfully I don't really like any of the old Superman's for various reasons, but I can at least respect them. In this one, they just made up super powers that Superman doesn't have, which I could even go with if they explained it.

My main beef with this one is, the bad guy, this Radiation Man, is supposed to be powered by the sun, and his powers are basically the sun's energy...and Superman get's his power from the yellow sun...therefore when this guy hits Superman with the energy then it should actually make Superman more powerful, but instead it gives him the flu???? If you're a Superman fan at all, you can watch this just to say you have seen it, but you probably won't like it.

""American Ninja"" and ""Invasion USA"" (another Canon laugher) are a couple of my favorite guilty pleasures. But in no way

do I want the great Superman lumped together in that category! What the hell was Warner Bros. thinking? I and a zillion other 10-year-olds idolized this flying God and jam-packed the theater that July weekend in 1987. Adults, too! Proving that there was still a big audience for the series despite a four year hiatus. And we're supposed to believe Warner Bros. wasn't expecting this! Thus letting Canon and their piggy bank budget take over and crank out a truly sorry addition to any movie series ever?!! Unbelievable. I could just see the big wigs in the screening room yelling at each other: ""I can't get it to look any better! You slashed the budget, man! Of course it's going to look like a cardboard cut-out being superimposed over outer space!"" And it's this faded-blue shot of Reeve we actually see repeated a few times. Sad. Which is not to say all shots came off amatuer. The landing are ok and some of the take-offs. But mostly it makes you wince. Or you're distracted from the abysmal effect because it's occuring to you that if Mariel Hemingway was taken into outer space just in her business suit her head would explode. Or you're growing increasingly tired of 'Nuclear Man' groaning like a werewolf over and over. Or the stupid and silly looking dub-job they do of his voice. Or his Freddy Krueger nails. Even Reeve at times seems to be going through the motions with old stand-by lines like ""Don't do it! The people!"", only kind of half yelled. You're bound to love his WWF moves on the moon, stepping on the bad guy's foot and then driving his knee upwards into his leaned-over head. Ah, geez. Long gone are those days of donning a red towel around your neck and soaring around the living room. If this had been the first film in the series? Yikes. Oh, the plot. It has to do with Hackman creating this new nemesis thinking it will finally get him world dominance, riches, whatever. So as Reeve is busy ridding the world of nukes, he inadvertently lobs one into the sun with the bad guy's DNA inside of it. Once it hits the sun, the guy is born and comes to earth to bug his eyes and talk like Gene Hackman. The cast is decent enough, as Reeve is still winning in both roles, Kidder returns and is adequate, and Hemingway is gorgeous. But you don't come for that. You want action and awe inspiring shots. They nearly had one, where Supes and Lois fly alongside a train through some picture-esque mountains. But when you're distracted by the horridness of the blue-screened actors, it really takes away from the moment. The only good shot is the final one....which they lift from the original, as they did with all the movies final shots! It just adds to how embarrassing it is to have your first movie from nine years earlier actually boast better special effects than your newer movie. I'd love to see a part five, with today's advances in movie making. But now the trouble lies in who to suit up in the blue and the red, with the unfortunate loss of Mr. Reeve.

That is a valuable point to make, but a successful franchise where the majority of the fanbase are kids IS NOT the place to make it. Older comic book fans were disgusted, and maybe I would be if I were to rewatch the film today. The point is, at six years old you don't tend to question or notice this blatant propaganda. However, even at six I remember thinking that ""Nuclear Man"" had a fantastic presence. I obviously didn't pay much heed to his acting...

It is sad that the ""Superman"" franchise makes up the highest profile hits of Christopher Reeve's career. The first couple of movies were great, the last two less than, but I sense he was capable of achieving much more in his field; especially when 'integrity' looked to be one of the lowest creative priorities by the time it came to this outing. Stick any kid under the age of, say, 8, in front of this and they MIGHT be entertained. Unless they're a child prodigy; in which case they'll probably run up something better with the camcorder inside an hour. Don't blame me if your kid is of above average intelligence and hates you for subjecting them to this. Adults? Do I even need to tell you that you should probably steer clear... ?"

The special effects are horrible and poorly done. Even Christopher Reeve, who gives his final performance as the Man of Steel, can't save this movie with his great acting. On the other hand, Gene Hackman's performance as Lex Luthor is lacking and leaves something to be desired.

2779,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"The Superman movies have never been exemplars of logic or internal consistency. Even the first, best two had numerous problems. But at the same time, they had good enough plots, effects, and performances to make you willing to overlook the problems for the most part. Not so with this waste of celluloid.

The effects are the worst part. One head-on flying shot is used at least four times through the movie! And it wasn't well done to begin with. The rest of the thankfully sparse effects were even worse, up to (or DOWN to) the ludicrous fight on the Moon.

Very nearly as bad was the plot. When it wasn't utterly forgettable (85% of the movie), it was excruciating. It's hard to believe that co-writer Lawrence Konner was involved in the writing of Star Trek VI - The Undiscovered Country. There were reports that this movie suffered badly because it was cut severely for the theatrical release, but it's difficult if not impossible to imagine more scenes doing anything but making us squirm more in our seats.

Then there was the acting. Mark Pillow as Nuclear Man: I think that says it all. Ugh. Jon Cryer was somewhere between Pillow's performance and fingernails on chalkboard. Only somewhat less competent was the child actor whose character gets Superman to start questioning the wisdom of nuclear weapons. He was more wooden than the boy playing Lana Lang's son in Superman III.

If you managed to look past them, you might see the rather interesting idea of what might happen if a superhero got involved with politics (we see Superman brooding!). What's sad is that we've seen other film-makers, like James Cameron, make great films out of shoe-string budgets (just look at 1984's ""The Terminator""), and yet these guys totally dropped the ball. Even star Christopher Reeve admitted that this one came out ""ersatz"". But at least Reeve stayed with the series to the end, he didn't turn his back on it because he wanted more money or anything like that.

2790,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987),3.7,Sidney J. Furie,"When franchise movies get long on the tooth, it become disheartening to see how far it can go with such bad qualities. Among all the films related to the man of steel up until this film, this entry was considered by far the worst in the filmography. The fact that some actually considered Supergirl (1984) to be better than this film spoke to many that something was not right with the direction of the films. However, when revisiting the film, it turns out what people may not like may not make this sequel as terrible as some other films go. Sure, it still doesn't match up to the original or the second film, but it is definitely not unwatchable. Surprisingly, as much as the cast was not getting along, it's very hard to tell that people were not enjoying themselves in the making of this feature.

The plot revolving around this feature takes place when the arms race continues to escalate between super powered countries. Feeling a need to do something after a young boy sends him a letter, Superman AKA Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) looks to find a solution. Seeing the opportunity in Superman's involvement, the ever scheming Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) breaks out of prison with the help of his nephew Lenny (Jon Cryer). Luthor's plan is to create a being just as strong as Superman. Meanwhile the daily planet is being taken over by David Warfield (Sam Wanamaker) and his daughter Lacy (Mariel Hemingway), who ends up developing feelings for Clark.

The script was written by Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal who both wrote for The Legend of Billie Jean (1985) and The Jewel of the Nile (1985) prior to this. Seeing that part of the film's production problems came from the budget, it could be said that they both had to work with whatever they could. However, there are parts to the story that don't make any sense in continuity. Such as people breathing in space aside from Superman or Luthor having the know-how of creating another superhuman. There's also meaningless supporting characters such as Lenny and Lacy. Both of them do not contribute anything to the overall story and neither of them have a purpose other than hijinks.

If anything, the worst offender is the big baddie, Nuclear Man played by Mark Pillow. Not only does Pillow give a rather goofy over the top performance, but his weapon of choice is very lame. Fingernails,....that's right fingernails. This not only makes the action between him and Superman laughable but almost embarrassing. Forget all the mediocre special effects the production used,...they could have at least thrown their fists at one another. That's one thing Superman III (1983) got right. Thankfully, most of the other fun characters return like Perry White (Jackie Cooper), Jimmy Olsen (Marc McClure), Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) and even William Hootkins as an arms dealer.

While the effects are not always on par with prior films, at least they feel closer to the first two superman films than that of the third film. Director Sidney J. Furie did his best to keep it that way along with his cinematographer Ernest Day. Furie was the director of Iron Eagle (1986), while Day had worked on Running Scared (1972). All shots are kept steady and have a good number of shots that capture the large scope of the setting. The best component to this feature though was the score composed by Alexander Courage. While not having the same grab as John Williams, Courage uses Williams' theme for Superman to a great extent making it sound almost like Williams was there. Not only is the score fully fleshed out but matches in tone as well to the rest of the films.

Saying this is the worst film in the series is a bit hard to say. Superman III (1983) got several things wrong as well. At least here it felt more like the first two. Yes the effects are not as polished and continuity issues are vast, however the music, camerawork and returning actors put in one more performance that still retains the Superman feel."

Instead, we get this film, ending Superman for good, doing better than Doomsday, and only 30 years after it we get other Superman movie, to you see how much damage this film did it to the character. The plot is okay, but is the development that gets all wrong.

First of all, Christopher, Kidder and Hackman tries hard, their perfomances are good enough, even with the bad writing, Lex Luthor character becomes a cliché, the biggest criminal mind of our generation, I get it, and he gains another dumb goon, basically the character goes to nowhere. Lois Lane is another character that suffers from bad writing, at least they could let her and Super be together, Superman interfered in the course of humanity already, he could be with her as well. It started as it ended, no changes in the status quo.

The film started well, nuclear war, good moments, everythings okay, but after Nuclear Man everythings go downhill and would be a waste of time list all errors, believe me, it's a lot. The movie does not justice to Superman, he deserved more."

Where to start? Well, Lex Luthor escapes from prison, which is about as difficult as walking out of a Wal-Mart with a candy bar. And no one seems to care.

Then there is Nuclear Man (or as Luthor repeatedly days, ""Nuke-yuh-ler"") who is about as intimidating as a man in an irridescent jumpsuit with long silver fingernails, because that's what he is. Apparently related genetically to Superman this Sun-powered villain seems to have missed out on the brains gene, or maybe not because our brilliant hero can't seem to figure out that stopping a sun powered villain would simply mean putting somewhere dark.

But regardless of the mishmash of pointlessness that is the script and special effects on par with a high school play this is still a cinematic marvel as compared to Superman II which might actually be the worst waste of celluloid in history.

Your IQ will probably drop a little if you watch this, but if you feel you have a few points to spare give it a shot."

Even though the acting from Gene Hackman and the actor who plays Lenny Luthor sounds like they really don't care, Christopher Reeve is still giving it his all. Despite all it's flaws like Superman's Great Wall Rebuild-o-Vision, Captain Scratchy, no attempt to make Metropolis any different from New York City, a pointless scene of Clark Kent juggling dates as himself and Superman, a human woman breathing and falling in space, and using a mountain to plug an erupting Mt. Vesuvius which would actually cause pressure to build up an cause and even bigger and more devastating, this movie is still fun nonsense trashy so-bad-it's-good garbage, like watcing a movie you think you're gonna hate but actually find yourself liking it a little by the time the end credits roll. This so-called ""Worst Movie of All Time"" is certainly not as bad as Manos: The Hands of Fate, but it IS one of the better movies of that category, belonging in the same party as Plan 9 From Outer Space, the Gamera films, and Troll 2. But if you do find a copy of Superman IV in the wild, after you scoff at the idea of such a bad movie starring Superman, give it a watch. You may be pleasantly surprised."

Anihilation, though, suffers from an extreme case of sequelitis, with about half of the characters re-cast, all of which were a step down, a dumb story line, wooden acting, effects that were less advanced than the ones in the first movie, and a feeling of blah pervading the whole thing. Perhaps the worst thing is the fight at the end with the two really bad CG ""animalities"", a cheesy idea from the game that should have stayed in the game.

2806,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"The problem with Mortal Kombat: Annihilation isn't that it's stupid, with no significant plot, dialogue or characters. That is undebatably true of Annihilation, but that was also true with the first Mortal Kombat movie, and that was a great movie. The problem is the HUGE let down in the martial arts and special effects scenes. MK had some terrific fight scenes, such as the brilliant Cage/Scorpion fight in the forest, the great Liu Kang/SubZero fight, and the cool finale with Shang Tsung. Annihilation didn't have any fight scenes up to the quality of those three, many of the fight scenes made no sense, and the finale was horrible. In addition, some things in Annihilation I would really like an explanation for:

Why did Raiden dress up like Aladdin half way through the movie? Was looking like a complete dork part of becoming mortal? And where was Christopher Lambert, anyway?"
2807,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"I have been a big fan of MK since the beginning, although I must admit I lost interest in the game series after part III.

Buying MK Deception this past Christmas renewed my interest in the series.

This movie was crap and I can't believe I bought this mess.

Good thing I found it for 9.99 at the used bin, so I wasn't out of much.

I was expecting to see a REAL sequel to the first movie, which I found fairly entertaining.

I thought the first film was very good and does the game upon which it is based some justice.

Not the case with MKA.

The first problem is that they tried to fuse too much of MK2 with MK3.

Then, if you're going to replace a character with another actor (Christopher Lambert), then at least make sure the new actor does a batter job than the first. The first Raiden was a hard-ass, and you knew not to mess with him. The second Raiden was a wuss and every time we saw him he was going through a wall.

Weak portrayals of major MK characters was another flaw.

The actress who portrayed Sonya Blade was nowhere near as good as Bridgette Wilson (the first Sonya).

Same could be said with Cage (Linden Ashby).

What was the point of even having Ermac and Rain in the movie if they weren't going to be referred to? A very weak portrayal of Sindel, Kitana's mother and the actress who played her isn't fit to act in soap operas.

Line example: Kitana: ""My mother is dead."" Sindel: ""As will be her daughter!"" Gimmie a break! Stick with the first."
2808,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"By all that's Holy! A film that made me cringe the whole way through! Dear Lord how the studio bosses must have laughed as they counted the money that they made off this turkey. Now, I thought the first MK was an OK film, great soundtrack, OK acting and plenty of fighting. A good no-brainer actioner. But this....this....defies belief.

How on Earth can you get such a bunch of wooden actors together and still manage to hide all the strings? It comes to something when you look at a film and can honestly say the best actor in it is Brian Thompson! The actors playing the bad guys overacted so awfully it was painful to watch, expecially the centaur guy. He exuded ham to a level I've not seen before.

The special effects were truly special, but only in a ""special needs"" kind of way. Looks like they were lifted straight from the video game itself. Laugh as you watch something resembling a dragon perform martial arts very badly. Laugh as Brian Thompson turns into a......thing. Laugh at the terrible lack of detail in it all. Laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh and laugh again, right up until they slap the straightjacket on you and cart you off to the loony bin. Because only someone truly demented would want to sit through this terrible, terrible film.

Eh? What's that Doc? Yes, I know I sat through it. But it was all in the name of science, you see. I was doing research. By the way, you couldn't loosen this jacket a bit, could you?

Anyway, as I say, the best actor was Brian Thompson. Only he saved it from getting a 1, but even then, the rest prevented it from getting any more than a 2.

I like the game and I admire low-budget movies with their cheap effects. But if you don't, simply DON'T WATCH IT. First play the MK games series and THEN compare with the movi"
2825,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"I must admit that I quite enjoyed the first film. Not the best martial arts flick in the world, but by no means the worst. However, compared to this, its a damn masterpiece!

1) There are WAAAAAY too many characters. In the first, you had the four heroes (Cage, Sonya, Kang, and Raiden), and about five villains (Kahn, Kano, Sub-zero, Scorpion, and Goro). This meant that at least some amount of time could be spent building on characters. Thus, before we see Sub zero,Goro and scorpion fight, we know who they are , and their reputations. This doesnt happen with a single character in MK:A because it is too busy trying to throw as many characters from the games at you as possible that it often doesnt even have time to mention who they are (e.g. Smoke, Cyrax, Rain, Baraka, Mileena).

2) It's had a $30 million budget, yet seems to have spent on completely the wrong things. I would have much rather they had halved their SFX budget and hired a decent fight choreographer. Put it this way: Iron Monkey cost less than $4 (if I remember correctly) for the entire film, and there isnt a single fight in MK:A that comes close to the worst in that film, which leads on to the next point.

3) The direction is TERRIBLE!! Especially during the fights!!! Watch any decent fight sequence, and generally the cuts are kept to a minimum. It both makes the fight easier to follow, and shows off the skill of the participants more. Its rare in this film that any flow between moves occurs without cuts. During one move, there are actually about five cuts!! No cuts would have looked much better!!

4) Its hard to decide which is worse, the script, or the acting.

5) The SFX heavy final battle is perhaps the lamest thing I have ever seen.

There are people who will defend this film saying that ""its just fun!"", or ""Its not meant to be deep and meaningful or anything"". Which works for some films. And those films can be fun. Or not deep and meaningful, but still enjoyable. This isnt. Its bad. It hasnt got one redeeming feature that I can think of. Possibly the worst film. Ever."
2826,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"OK let's not take this too seriously here. It's mortal kombat, the story sticks to the game (Street Fighter take note) and the fight scenes are pretty much brilliant for the time, and I'm a Bruce lee/tony jaa fan. Yes the special effects are HORRENDOUS and the acting is pretty bad sometimes...SOMETIMES.Although no excuse can be made for the script. We get to see basically all of the important MK characters (except,sadly, the return of shang and goro) all fulfilling their roles which they had in the game, which of coarse leads to them being rushed in and eventually under used. I like the general colour and fun atmosphere of it though,Emacs red,scorpions yellow,and of coarse liu kang being decimated by smoke for some reason in a very good fight scene.

Put simply, ""Mortal Kombat:Annihilation"" makes the ""American Ninja"" movies look like Bruce Lee masterpieces. The action was laughably stupid; the dialogue was utterly atrocious; and the plot somehow managed to lack a beginning, a middle, and an end. Did this movie even have an editor?

Well I guess you can't expect (and probably shouldn't) expect much from a movie based on a video game. I guess the only thing more ridiculous than making a movie based on a video game is making a movie based on a breakfast cereal.

Hmmm... I guess I won't be surprised to see ""Lucky Charms: Annihilation"" opening in cinemas soon...

The makers of MK:A should be thankful to movies like ""Night of the Lepus"", ""Dusk till Dawn"", or the ""Ernest Goes Somewhere or Does Something"" movies; for without them this movie would easily be the worst piece of cinematic sputum of all time."

2832,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"The first Mortal Kombat movie was a pretty decent movie that was fun to watch had some great fight scenes and did a great job turning a simple tournament fighting game into a movie adaptation for the big screen.

Mortal Kombat Annihlation was released two years after the 1995 original and had a different writer and director also given a low budget and only given a short time to shoot edit and produce the movie what we get is actually an okay movie nothing special unique or award winning but still a fun and action packed movie that has a great soundtrack actual martial arts stunts and fight choreography and a big cast of characters both good guys and bad the actors from the original also return for the sequel although one is killed in the opening scenes so minus one Johnny Cage.

A lot of the complaints about this movie were mainly about how over the top and cheesy the acting and dialogue is in the movie along with some bad costumes and special effects the movie got a bad reaction from audiences and critics and is often quoted as one of the worst video game movies ever made but in all honesty despite it's flaws this is a fun movie to watch and doesn't take itself to seriously you will laugh at how bad some parts are but if you grew up in the 80s and early 90s when Mortal Kombat was just a two dimension fighting game with cool looking characters you appreciate the fun and often over the top aspects of the movie having your favourite characters jumping into fights in bright coloured outfits and tights fighting to the not so bloody end while awesome music plays.

I recommend watching this movie if you enjoy fun action movies that don't take themselves too seriously and are just an hour and half of crazy fights overacting and cheesyness."

Okay, I really liked the first Mortal Kombat. Watching it again I kinda changed my mind, but really, it's a fun movie to watch (why the hell was Reptile so easy to beat though!?). So I was pretty stoked about seeing MK Annihilation, because, hey, it had all the nifty characters.

...if ever there were a movie for lining the bottoms of bird cages, this is it. Robin Shou, who was pretty inept in the first movie, was an outright AWFUL actor in this one. Motaro was an idiot, they skipped over Kintaro if I remember correctly. Why they did that, I don't know, I thought Kintaro was hardcore in MK2 (and utterly overpowered in MK Trilogy). Oh well. He wasn't that important anyhow.

Two redeeming points in this movie, for men only: Sonya and Mileena (?) fighting in the mud, and Jade.

The film is not amazing, the acting isn't amazing, the plot isn't amazing, the directing isn't amazing etc. However to anyone who enjoys martial arts there are real talented people in this film and a few nice martial arts moves to see.

There are not as many good martial arts moments as a good deal of other martial arts films, the film could have gotten a lot more out of all of this talent that's for sure, however there are still talented martial artists in this film and there are one or two nice moves to sit and watch for any true martial arts "

Mortal Kombat 2 is a real roller coaster. Fast and, yes it's unpredictable in some ways. Everybody say - CGI is bad. Yes, it is. But practical effects are good. Some sets are very beautiful. The rythm of fight scenes is on top with original Kang vs Reptile battle.

James Remar is fantastic as always, but it's not Raiden. I don't mind. I was video games fan in the 90s, and I know what pain is. No movie based on video games was ""right"" then.

2848,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"Well, let me tell you...it's a real let down. Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. I watched the original Mortal Kombat when I was about 10 years old, and it was bloody brilliant to me back then, it's still ""ok"" not absolute garbage, unlike its sequel.

Mortal Kombat: Annihilation has no substance, form, direction or anything remotely resembling a competent cast of actors. The director must have been a coffee machine or something, I really can't see why they decided to make a sequel. The first movie beats it easily.I quickly hit IMDb to check the scores of both the original and MK: Annihilation...

A dismal score of 5.0/10 for MK, and an even lower 3.0/10 for MK:Annihilation. So I was like...""Damn, this is a glorified power rangers..."" I could see from the start it was, when Raiden fires lighting at the beginning, it looks as though someone has put a giant bitmap overlaid onto the movie and moved it around a bit. RAIDEN btw, is now a less-hardcore version of the original kick ass Christopher Lambert Raiden, if you're gonna remove Lambert, then you need someone fairly bad ass, so what do they do? They give us a Doogie Howser lookalike who is in need of orthodontic work. Every time we see him he's through a brick wall or falling off something high. He's like a piece of ham, but with less acting ability. All his words of 'wisdom' are like ""We have to work as a team, courage...courage...look within yourself at your...courage."" Jax is just a token black guy, Sonya is admittedly hot, but not as hot and/or as kick ass as the original Sonya. Johnny Cage gets instantly killed by some 'thug' in a skull (the final 'boss') at the very beginning. Kitana and Liu Kang are just like the 'sexually' tense element of the film. They have the funniest (not meant to be funny) part of the movie, where the ""hardcore"" Sheeva, with 4 arms, having spent the entire movie looking fearsome and generally like a big, brutal beast...runs in and says ""The date is over."" In 5 seconds she gets killed by a falling cage, now that is comedy folks. 10 seconds of pure ""Why was she even in the movie?"" goodness.

There isn't a semblance of a decent camera angle, all the scenes are ""misty"" and ""firey/smokey"" and really don't add well to the overall ambiance of the movie, they make it seem more like an 8th Grade production of some bad Shakespeare play no one cares about.

OK, the first movie wasn't THAT good, but it was a 'heapload' better than the sequel, which IMHO should never have been made, I mean...they can't even use ""We needed to make money"" as an excuse, because I'm sure even the caterers who worked on this film have never been able to find work since.

Ah well, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, it's like the biggest disappointment to me, as for years I was like ""I have to see MK annihilation"" because the first one in my mind was embedded there as something ""good"". Thanks a lot John R. Leonetti I know now that you can't direct. At least not anything past Power Rangers or something? Anyhow, thats just how I felt about this movie. T_T"

2855,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"Having won the battle of the realms in the first film, Liu Kang (Robin Shou) and others enjoy a short period of peace on Earth. Then one day leader of the outer realm Shao Kahn (Brian Thompson) opens up a portal between the two realms and announces that he intends to merge the two realms in six days. With time ticking away, can Liu Kang and his crew stop Shao Kahn in time?

I didn't care much for the first film, but curiosity got the better of me so I decided that I'd give the sequel a shot (really just to see if it's as bad as its rating suggests, and sadly it is).

The first film had a storyline that was quite poorly developed, but it wasn't totally ridiculous. Here we basically have a 'world domination' storyline in place because the outer realm lost the battle with the Earth Realm. If you take away all the pretence then it boils down to the outer realm being sore losers. Playing this sequel as a straight forward revenge film would have been a better move.

I'm probably giving this film too much credit by discussing the story because it seemed like the writers didn't care much for the story themselves. It seemed that any time there was an attempt at character interaction or plot development that we would have a ridiculous fight sequence coupled with the over-bearing soundtrack that we saw in the first film. The first film was directed MTV Style, but this film looks as though it was directed by someone on acid - the fight sequences were much more over the top, the editing was choppy and the choreography was laughable. It's almost like the director went for the bigger is better approach, but it just doesn't quite work here.

The dialogue between the characters was laughable and painful. One of the worst examples of this is when Kahn is looking for a new general. This scene gives us some of the most cringe inducing exchanges of dialogue that I've ever heard. We're also handed some laughable plot twists, villains that are more cartoonish than anything else and don't even start me on the final fight scene between Liu Kang and Kahn sigh....

The only thing that made this film very slightly tolerable was Jax. He provided the film with the occasional moment of comic relief, but this aspect alone is not enough to save this utter shambles. The only other minor positive that I took from watching this sequel is that it made me appreciate the first film more. Yes the first film was quite a bad film with a multitude of problems, but it was nowhere near as embarrassing or laughable as this sequel."

2860,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"Mortal Kombat was a fine film, and one of the few films based on a video game to get it right. Mortal Kombat: Annihilation fails miserably. Where MK1 took the time to introduce you to the characters and submerge you in the world, MKA picks up from the end of the first movie and just throws a whole bunch of stuff against the wall.

Rain, Sheeva, Noob Saibot, Mileena, Smoke, Cyrax, Sub-Zero, Scorpion and Baraka all make completely unnecessary cameos that cripple their ability to actually play out their storylines in any future sequels. Raynor Scheine is a weak Shinnok, another character who just seems forced into the story. Nightwolf is a character with promise, and indeed, he does- promises to teach Liu Kang three things. Instead, he chucks an axe at Liu's head and teaches him nothing.

Sandra Hess takes over Bridgette Wilson's role as Sonya, but fails to give the requisite attitude needed to win over the audience. We don't believe her connection to Cage, who is not only replaced by another actor, but killed off altogether within the first five minutes completely unceremoniously.

James Remar is laughably weak as Raiden, a role which veteran actor Christopher Lambert previously completely owned. His performance is bland and uninspired, and the jokes seem forced. Brian Thompson gives a cringingly bad interpretation of Shao Kahn, the ""super villain"" who's afraid of his own father and leaves the audience wondering if he was really suppoed to be all that bad. John Medlen's Ermac is silent and unimportant, and Deron McBee's Motaro is a completely two dimensional character.

Meanwhile, original cast members Robin Shou and Talisa Soto act emotionlessly and without gusto, something definitely not lacking in their earlier performance.

Some of the bright spots in the film come courtesy of newcomers Lynn Williams, Musetta Vander, and Irina Pantaeva, who do surprisingly good jobs as Jax, Sindel, and Jade, respectively, though Pantaeva's character is disposed of at completely the wrong time.

The movie is cheap, and cut corners, including Baraka's supposed death scene, which is just a repeat of Rain being knocked into the fire, and the cheap animalities that closed the movie, which are infamously the worst feature of an awful movie. Overall, one is left with the sense that the producers didn't care about the characters of the Mortal Kombat universe, which the first movie definitely left you satisfied.

So, overall, I give it an 8/10. Why?

It's so bad, it's good.

It's the kind of movie you sit down and laugh your ass off at. Not because it's a comedy, but because it's so bad, that it's genuinely entertaining.

So, if you can put aside the fact that the premise for a possibly good sequel was butchered by bad acting, bad effects, too many characters, needless deaths, and cheap production, it's a fantastic flick to watch with your friends if you're in the mood for what will soon be a cult classic."

The one problem I have with this one is that too many of the scenes could only be understood by a fan of the games. I am one but I got a little tired of answering such questions as these (with answers to help the fan impared):

""What are these robots here for?"" Cyrax, Smoke and Sektor are robots out to get subzero for betraying his clan. To fit them in this film they were reprogrammed to go after our heroes.

""Who was that chick in the pink who looked like Kitana and attacked Sonya?"" That was Mileena, Kitana's Evil Twin.

""What about that thing with the blades and the severe need for an orthodontist?"" Baraka. A freaky weirdo from the games who is never really explained

""And the Shao-Kahn's four cronies?"" The red guy is Ermac, a somewhat enigmatic fighter for Mortal Kombat 3

The purple one is Rain. A weather controlling ninja who is killed before doing anything cool in this film.

The 4-armed freak is Sheeva. Sindel's shokan guardian thought up by taking a hindu god, giving it a sex change and mis-spelling its name

The centaur is Motaro, a sub-boss from the games who's species hate's Sheeva's species.

""Who is Nightwolf?"" An indian who really kicks butt in the games

""What is this animality crapola?"" A type of fatality from the game in which you turn into an animal and kick butt

My one real problem with this film is that fact that Christopher Lambert and Bridgette Wilson seem to have been replaced. Why?

Unlike the first one, this film has not been able to resist following the games too religiously. It attempts to cram in all the elements and characters from at least 2 of the games, sacrifising story and credibility for it. This, coupled with the Z-grade acting and the risible and overused CGI, add up to what is probably the worst film I have ever seen. 1"

However, the rest of the movie was pretty good. Action packed, a lot of the martial arts was wild stuff, really odd and well, interesting moves, some really crazy stuff to watch.

For the avid MK game player the ending holds a solid adrenalin rush. Again based off of the MK mythology, it lacks much of the human dimension brought in the original by the Johnny Cage/Sonya Blade interaction and Liu Kang realizing he must fight for something better than his hatred/mission of vengeance and defend the realm of earth. In this movie Liu Kang is the hero in white, without the personal demons he had to face in the first. The fights are spectacular and quite enjoyable. The movie is great-especially if viewed directly following the original MK mo"
2873,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"Wow. where to start with this...

This movie is pretty much a complete bomb in every aspect. With an exception of Lui Kang and Kitana, EVERY character is replaced. and not for the better.. Personally, I think Sonya Blade is hotter in this one than the first but she's a worse actor so that pretty much cancels out.

The story is garbage! It doesn't even follow the game! It's clearly noticeable that the ONLY goal as far as the story, was for it to include as many characters and their 'in-game moves' as they could regardless of their back stories. For example, Jax is a character that lost his arms in the game and replaces them with robotic ones. In the movie, he has his arms but they are 'muscle enhancers'... doesn't even make much sense to me.

I honestly can't tell if the script is god-awful or the acting. Was it a great script that was poorly performed or great performances that had to be executed the way they were due to how it was written? I take that back. I can tell. It's both a terrible script with god awful performances.

Sets, costumes, and stunts were all pretty bad as well. The costumes make you feel like you're in a college Halloween party while the sets look like they were cheaply made at my mom's house.

The stunts/fight scenes are all executed in a way that made them seem like they were trying to be the deleted fight scene of a power rangers episode.

The soundtrack from the first movie went platinum! In 10 days!! This time? It sounded like a 10 year old kid's Zumba class...

Overall, this movie ONLY to be watched as a joke. It is the epitome of the thought that a video game should STAY a video game! I gave it 3 stars because I'm a huge fan of the game so seeing some of my favorite characters was cool (even if I had to be some form of intoxicated to enjoy it) and also, this movie helped guide me to know what NOT to have made my scorpion Halloween costume look like."

2875,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"People tend to critize every little thing about this film. MKA is made up of 3 things. Fast Paced martial arts action, crazy moves, enterainment value. This is coming from a person who has only played the 1st MK game that ever came out. The plot is easy to follow and basic which I like. I can't think of a movie like this having some complicated plot that requires the use of a pad of paper and pencil to take down notes. Basically the plot is about a guy named Shal Kahn who opens the portals from his world called outworld to Earth. Rayden the thunder god gathers a bunch of supposely best fighters in the world. Each has there own thing to do. The character JAX and Sonya do nothing but fight various people that come upon and go flying 10 meters away when hit. JJ Perry's stunts as Scorpion and Cyrax were pretty decent if not good. The fight scenes were unorganized and sort of hard to follow. Using a million different cameras they were able to make the fights look faster which was good. Fight scenes aren't usually hard to follow but in the team fight with Jax and Sonya they kept on switching fights every 2 seconds where they fought Cyrax and a bunch of Ninjas. Special effects were decent. Obvisouly you could tell the last fight between Liu Kang and Shal Kahn was computerized as they turned into there animalities. The fights were a bit overdone. Jax pushing a metal platform at Cyrax and Cyrax for some reason finds the need to almost a 360 degree flip in mid air (showed in slow motion). Alot of the falls were over done. Lots of fighters flying off of platforms onto padding you can't see. Must of had alot of medical technicans near by just in case during the filming. Explosions were used frequently. In the fight between Smoke and Liu Kang Smoke goes flying down a hole in the ground and a extremely stage looking controlled explosion errupted naturally showing Sub Zero covering his face as a stuntman does when an explosion occurs. The editors did there best to make the special effects pyro and actual stunts work together but you could really tell what was being used at the time to make the scenes look more exciting. Can you please tell me why Shal Kahn and Rayden needed to fly through the air to get to each other to talk? Just another example of something used to cover up a boring part. that ""bow to me"" line sounded unconvincing and something that came out of a school stage production. Overall I did enjoy this film and have it on video. If you just forget about the minors glitches its a excellent film for people who like overdone martial arts action. :)"

2879,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"Simply put it this way, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation follows the videogames better than the first film did. Here are the reasons why: The first film just didn't seem like Mortal Kombat, even though it was a good film, but Mortal Kombat: Annihilation seems to surpass it in the action, and depiction. Annihilation follows the games a lot more, because they feature more characters that are from the games, more moves that are from the game, and definitely the characters of Scorpion and Sub-Zero have better suits, but I suppose that they had crap suits in the first one because they had bad suits in the first game, I don't know. The first film Sub-Zero's ice ball, or freeze maneuver, was over exaggerated a lot. In the games, it does not take that long for him to produce an ice ball. In Annihilation, he just does it like in the game. Sonya, in here uses her trademark move, the ""kiss of death"", but in this installment, it has a different effect than in the games. The choreography was also very good, I thought so. Lots of people say that the fight scenes were overhauled by cheesiness, but I really don't understand why they say that. The acting is definitely what you would expect in these types of films, good, and imperfect. Sometimes the acting would be overhauled by the cheesy screenplay. The scene where Sub-Zero first makes an appearance is a good example. Sub-Zero says some crap to Liu Kang, I forgot what, something like, ""You killed my brother in the first tournament, and now you will have to fight again"", something like that, I forgot. The screenplay can only be cheesy sometimes, but its not all that bad. Another example of a cheesy screenplay, is Scorpion uttering out the word ""Suckers!"" instead of ""Get over here!"". Like I said, the acting isn't bad, its just what you would expect in a typical action/adventure flick. The story seems to remain the same, just with new characters, and new threat, but overall, I don't give a crap about the story. Character costumes, like I mentioned earlier, are very good, but that only applies to characters that have the same ninja outfit as Scorpion and Sub-Zero, because characters like Cyrax, and Smoke, look terrible. It was clear that their chest protectors were made out of plastic, and their masks look terrible as well. I basically described the entire movie, so I'll tell you the things that I really didn't like about the film. Her it goes: They took out Bridgett Wilson, she was hotter than the other girls who played as Sonya. They took out Christopher Lambert, and replaced him with this weird guy, and to top it off, they give Raiden a damn flat-top! Overall, I felt that Annihilation was better than the previous film, because it had the real Mortal Kombat persona. 9 out of 10."

The general wackness of the acting and the dialogue is forgivable (this is, after all, a mortal kombat movie) but every other aspect of this travesty of action filmmaking isn't.

Oh, and another thing, why is it that .. oh forget it. I'm not going to waste any more time discussing this pitiful excuse of a video game to movie adaptation.

I recall seeing this movie in the theater when it first came out, and asking myself multiple times ""how in the world did you agree to see this movie?"". In truth, I had actually gone with a friend who was big into the whole Mortal Kombat series. And just for being a nice friend, I was treated to a movie of unspeakable wretchedness. I absolutely hated that flick -- perhaps the longest hour and a half of my life. And that's when I was a teenager, still possibly vulnerable to movies like this.

Well, if I hated it then, you can imagine how much I hated it this time around. It's about 90 minutes of non-stop hackneyed fighting, complete with wooden acting, awful special-effects (which is pretty pitiful, given that action is about the only thing a movie like this is expected to deliver) a plot that might fly in a second-rate video game, and laughable dialouge.

This movie is so bad, it makes Saturday morning cartoons look like Academy Award-winning material. And that's about the only level in which you could even begin to derive any enjoyment out of this nonsense: if you were an 8 year-old boy watching TV at 8am on a Saturday morning."

2898,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"Oh, come on. You didn't actually expect this movie to be good, did you? It's about a game with too many characters, unwieldy fighting mechanics, and a 'plot' that is simply an excuse for the characters to beat up on each other. So, in other words, MK: Annihilation is a perfect adaptation of MK3:Ultimate Turbo Spaz Fighting or whatever the final sequel of that one they came out with was.

Don't try to follow the storyline. As far as I could tell, these 3-5 people who seem to be the main good guys (Rayden, Liu Kang, Sonya, Jax, Kitana) walk around randomly and fight random people, for little to no reason at all. They're supposed to be building up an army and building their skills or something, but that never happens. In fact, Liu Kang just magically gets his skillz back before fighting Mr. Evil Man for no reason also-after having spent most of the film getting beat up by everyone and their second cousin. I think even I could have a good chance of giving this yutz a beatdown, as directed.

Don't try to follow all the characters. MK:A tries to force in EVERY SINGLE OBSCURE CHARACTER that's ever been in these games, which I guess may be good if you're initiated. Otherwise, you won't give a Motaro's tail about anyone. I suppose even Boon Saibot was in there somewhere-and Stryker (the dopey-cop who only I ever played in the game) even gets a mention. You'll just throw up your hands in the first 15 minutes, and give up on these people.

Don't count on the effects or the fighting to save you either, because both are woefully poor. Your best bet for entertainment is to try to count the plot holes. I myself lost track. They build characters and points up, never to use them again. Oh well. It's a great bad movie night flick, but don't expect any more. It could probably be a great drinking game, too. Take a shot whenever a new character is brought in, and if you're not wasted by the end, well, you probably turned it off already."

When Rayden sacrifices his immortality to save human beings, only for the director to forget about it completely and the humans still have to save themselves.

The way that they crammed every character into the movie to tie in with the game, Sheeva was one such character, in the movie for 15 seconds of film time.

The part when Sub Zero 'flies' into the cave, although the editor didn't realise that he left the harness visible in the picture.

And particularly, When Brian Thompson (who wins the hotly contested prize for best actor in the movie, and i mean HOTLY!) forges his line in mid sentence : 'Foolish....Child'

Notably, there is more characters, but this only adds to a confusion that has started since the beggining of the movie. Unless you played the video games religiously, cameo performances by Rain, Nightwolf and Maleena will go un-noticed. Now for my favourite subject, the cast.

Robin Shou and Talisa Soto reprise their roles as Liu Kang and Princess Kitana, but without Christopher Lambert as Rayden the movie severely lacks a spark. James Remar was pathetic in every way, I was not impresed at all. Irina Pantaeva and Musetta Vander were all right in thier roles and Sandra Hess made a decent Sonya. Lynn ""Red"" Williams absolutely stank, and personally I wouldn't cast him for anything.

The fight scenes were un-realistic and appealed only to children who went home and acted them out after they had seen it. Sheeva's was particularly pathetic. The special affects were terrible, especially in the final fight scene.

The music was great again, so in my opinion, don't waste the $10.00 for a ticket, spend $30.00 and get the CD. Overall a meagre 3/10."
2910,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"One question, where the hell is Christopher Lambert in this movie? Lambert was cool in Mortal Kombat as the lightning God, Lord Rayden. He kept the first Mortal Kombat movie alive. Lambert was the major star of the original movie. James Remar is ok as Rayden in this movie, but know where near as good as Lambert.

This movie isn't bad. I tend to think that the fight scenes are better in Mortal Kombat annihilation, but overall the original Mortal Kombat movie is bet"
2911,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"This film was an embarrassment, in every sense of the word. A direct affront to anyone who enjoyed the computer game or back-story of Mortal Kombat.

Given the interesting characters and deep (well, for a beat-em-up computer game) storyline of the game, to churn out a rubbishy, offensively-bad celluloid turd like this is really beyond the pale. Oh, and when I say offensive, I mean it. If I came home from work and found this film in bed with my *mum*, I probably wouldn't dislike it much more.

Why is it so bad? God knows, but an apparent budget of $12.50 can't have helped. *How* is it so bad? Hmmm. Flimsy storyline. Awful special effects. Excessive corniness. Cheese in over-abundant quantities. Acting that isn't even so-bad-it's-good, just so-bad-it's-bloody-awful. Sets that wobble. Actors that wobble. A plot-writer who doesn't undertand the term ""suspense"". Or, for that matter, ""plot"".

Don't get me wrong - I like cheesy, c**p films as much as the next man/woman/house-pet, but there is a limit. This film didn't just cross that limit, it shot straight past it without slowing.

Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is a long way over the C**p event horizon, and still accelerating.

I actually feel cheated that I wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this. A tip: if someone offers you a choice of either watching MK:A or getting severe beating, take the baseball bat every time. It'll be over quicker, and ultimately probably be less painful."

Now i am no film critic, but i do know what a good/bad movie is, and this isn't worthy of being called bad, it sullens the good name of bad, it is absolute garbage. The first one was half decent, this is so stupid it defies belief, half the original cast disapeared, (i wonder why), and the two that remained must be on a suicide mission to destroy their careers. The plot.....wait a minute, what plot, this didn't have one, they may have mentioned something about the world ending in six days, but i wasn't really paying attention, the special effects were so bad that they weren't even worth laughing at, i noticed that someone on here said that they didn't want to give away the ending, why not, because somebody might not actually predict it in the first half, rayden dies, and the good guy and the bad guy turn in to CGI dragons and have a fight, good guy wins, rayden is brought back life and everybody lives happily ever after, except the viewer, that is.

2913,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"This film could have had so much. I once saw in a special about the X-Men movie that there were two kinds of fans of the film: those who wanted a direct translation and those who were just excited to see the characters on the big screen. The same applies to MK:A. However, in this case, they should have gone for direct translation. It seems as though this film's only purpose was to cram in as many Mortal Kombat characters as could fit in an hour and a half. The film was also ruined by inconsistant casting: there were about eight (Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Blade, Cage, Rayden, Liu Kang, Kitana, and Jax) characters that appeared in both films. So how many were cast the same the second time around? Two (three if you count Ed Boon as the voice of Scorpion). If you're not a fan of the games, don't even bother.

2914,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"I firmly believe that going to a movie in the theater should be a pleasant experience 95% of the time. However, I have come to realize (as most others have) that when you go to see a movie in the theater, there is one indisputable fact: ANY movie shown in the smallest theater space within 1 week of its opening should be run from... even before the previews for other horrid films start rolling!!! Needless to say, I decided to give this film a chance. All the other reviews mention the main problems: an overabundance of special effects combined with a plot similar to the anecdotes a 3rd grader writes on a bathroom stall. This film wanted to be what the first film was: unique, fun, even entertaining. IT ISN'T. However, let's remember a few things. (1)video games RARELY translate well into movies (cases in point - Double Dragon and Super Mario Bros.). (2) Sequels should have more than 2 actors returning from the first film (you know that even Christopher Lambert was glad he dodged this bomb). And finally, (3) Films should have a plot people can follow. This film tried to cover material in 2 video games and it simply ended up being a colossal mess. Personally, I would be less interested in the 'fate o' the world' stuff and more interested in asking questions like: ""Hey, how'd he age backwards? Who invited the Minotaur to this party?"" and the like. By now, no one else will ever have to see this in the theater as I did. Be thankful."

2916,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"This movie was just short of spectacular, but it lacked only a few things:

1. Actors that could act

2. Actors that knew martial arts

3. A plot

4. Someone who can write dialogue

5. More Jade

The martial arts is so choppy and illogical, it reminded me of cheesy 70's/80's Chinese kung fu films, only worse. A lot of hits caused characters to fly in random directions, and even granting MK is not realistic is no excuse.

This movie is a GREAT laugh; however, make sure to watch it with friends in case you choke on the popcorn."

2918,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"This movie had a few good fight scenes and that was it. The final fight was horrible because of the bad CG they used for most of it. The few fight scenes where very far between. Actually there probably wasn't a good fight. I'm probably just remembering bits and pieces from different fights. The acting was bad but that didn't bother me, the acting was bad in the first Mortal Kombat as well. I found a whole bunch of this movie was just clumped together around a start and end. This is just a movie that should be avoided unless you're in the mood for an ugly film.

2919,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"It's really too bad this film did so bad. The only reason I have it in my collection is that it's one of the few works Robin Shou is in, as I got to be a fan watching the first film.

No one ever goes out and says, ""I'm gonna make the worst film ever!"" They really thought they were making something cool here. In their eyes, yes. You could say that they wanted to cash in on Mortal Kombat's popularity. I really don't know what could have saved this film. Maybe if they'd waited... I have to agree with many fans who said it was a rush job.

Never judge a film by its trailer. I was under the impression that it was going to be the best movie ever. Sheesh.

It starts out explaining the first one a bit and jumps into this one. But just about EVERYTHING changed at that point. Kitana and Liu Kang were the only ones left and their acting was awful. I mean come on.. I KNOW Robin can do better than that... just look at the first film. I really don't think he was satisfied with it. While the martial arts are lightning quick... there are too many slo mo's.

I feel bad, because I can usually see the good in many things.

I even defended Baby Geniuses (but that could just be my love for cute things and babies...)

But this just fell flat on its ass.

Ker plunk."
2920,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"This movie obviously had more money than the first but it was no where near as good. The plot-line was dodgy to say the least and it was as if they wanted to get as many of the characters (and their moves) in as possible. Unfortunately this meant that characters from the game were added purely for the sake of it. They weren't given any development or good fights.

The fighting in general was very poor. Raiden had the only average fight, the others were sub-standard. The fight at the end between...well, I don't want to spoil it; let's just say the 'the fight' at the end had awful FX and was impossible to follow.

Even the soundtrack was not as good as the first movie even though KMFDM were involved in both.

All-in-all not a very good movie on its own...put up against the original MK it's a terrible movie."

Oh wait... someone already did it. It's called Mortal Kombat Annihilation. A bunch of random fight scenes strung together with an invisible plot, or was it even there at all? Special FX weren't THAT bad for most of the movie but the end fight scene graphics were the worst I've seen in a while. Fight scenes were crappy. The only good one was when Raiden was fighting all the Reptiles, that was actually pretty cool. Thanks to the Martial Arts genius of Ray Park. He is a god. This movie was crap.

STREET FIGHTER FANS, REJOICE! If you thought that Van Damme movie was aweful, you ain't seen nothin' yet! Even though Mortal Kombat is one of the lousier video games out there, and even though I despise its existence, MK:ANNIHILATION is something I wouldn't wish to my worst enemy!

I really wish I could say more, but why waste time when I can convey my message/review in just one short sentence: THIS IS ONE KORNY PILE OF KRAP! When they said ""Nothing can prepare you"" they sure said it, even though I wonder if they knew what they meant.

I was gonna give this, um, ""movie"" a rating on a 5-scale, but I don't think it deserves a ZERO.. but that IS the lowest score I can think of...

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you REALLY want to enjoy this movie, try stomping on it, driving your car over it, tossing it into a blast furnace, smashing it as hard as you can with a sledge hammer for as long as possible, among other things."
2925,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"This is hands down the WORST movie that I've ever seen, and being a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fan, I've seen a LOT of bad movies.

There are absolutely no redeeming qualities in this steaming pile of crap. I've seen porno movies with better plots than this. As far as I can tell, our heros just wander around blindly for the entire movie going from one fight scene to another. Infact, some characters in this movie appear out of nowhere, fight some other character that has appeared out of nowhere, and then neither are seen again for the rest of the film. This MIGHT be excusable if the fight scenes were in some way entertaining or exciting. Sadly, that isn't the case. Every fight scene is exactly the same and always seems to involve our hero being launched backwards about 10 meters from a single hit.

It takes some of the worst acting in the world to take a script THIS bad and make a movie that's even worse, but Mortal Kombat: Annihilation does it with ease.

Believe me when I say ANYTHING is better than watching this garbage! Avoid it at ALL costs! I'm sure being forced to watch this movie is considered torture in some parts of the world!"
2926,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"I really liked the first movie. I thought it was an entertaining film with a decent cast, sharp action scenes and special effects, and the movie paid respectful attention to its source material.

MK Annihilation is anything but a good film.

It comes off like a bad Power Rangers episode, with most of the original actors gone, goofy camera angles and zoom shots, no story and pathetic special effects. ""Animality""? Please. I've seen better stuff out of old ""Gamera"" movies. This movie introduced almost every character from Mortal Kombat Trilogy only to kill them off five seconds after their debut. What's the point of that other than to say that ""this character"" was in the movie? All it accomplished was bogging down what little plot there is. The story itself (based off MK3 and MK4), was shaky, the techno music was nowhere near as good as the first film, and the whole movie seemed uneven and a waste of film. It lacked the feel of a movie, and earned the second 1997 award of a ""film that I almost walked out of in the first fifteen minutes.""

I've talked to more than a fair share of people who have said this movie is ""wonderful"". Of course, all of these people were die-hard MK fans who feel that anything with the famous dragon logo can do no wrong.

Want a Mortal Kombat movie to watch? Watch the first film. At least that one is a fun movie to sit through and enjoy. Too bad MK:A didn't live up to the first one. The line ""Pretty cool, huh? That's my Animality"" made me absolutely groan in agony that I actually spent money to see this. Avoid this movie."
2927,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"I've seen some bad movies. I've seen some REALLY bad movies.

But I wouldn't want to offend the 'Bad' and 'Really Bad' movies by calling MK2 one of them. This movie was truly the bottom of the barrel when it comes to Hollywood.

Right off the bat, I knew things were going to suck. The actors had changed into wussy shadows of their MK1 selves. Christopher Lambert, while not being an excellent actor, was still VERY cool in the first Mortal Kombat. I had a bad feeling in the back of my brain when they replaced him with a...well...character that not only looked wimpy, but acted like a fly-swatter.

The special defects...uh...special 'effects' in this movie were horrible! I'm not asking for fully rendered, super-resolution 3D ""Star Wars Ep 1"" environments...just enough technological know-how to make the movie look okay.

The poor bastards couldn't even get close to those fairly forgiving expectations.

The plot? None. Bad guy suddenly comes back, even though MK1 stated it was over and done with. Characters go and show up like it was a frat party. NOTHING in the movie is worth latching onto for a fun ride.

All in all, the only good that came of my watching this movie was the fact I got to see the cool, spooky ""Dark City"" trailer at the beginning.

Don't waste your time. Trust me like you've never trusted anyone else in your life on this."

Everything was bad, the story problems are probably what bothered me most. Little was accurate to what any MK fan would know.

This movie is by far one of the worst pieces of crap ever to have been produced for the screen. I'd rather sit through an entire season of ""Days of our lives"" than even touching MKA again.

The first movie was quite fun to watch. The action sequences and the special effects were OK for it's time, Christopher Lambert starred (that's right, I DO like Lambert!), and it had a killer soundtrack. Annihilation on the other hand is set place in the worst digitally made world possible, ALL the time! Lambert is replaced by some stupid looking guy who thinks he's cool but looks like my grandfather. The plot is, besides non-existing, stupid stupid and stupid, and the fighting scenes were already made in the first movie (except when the only two female characters of any significance fight in a pool of mud). On top of all this, the actors could easily be replaced by monkeys, no one would know.

Quite frankly I can't believe that this movie was released at the same time as Spawn. Spawn's special effects, music and plot were generally way above the standard set by this movie. It doesn't even classify as a B grade movie, simply because the quality was *so* appalling that there was nothing to laugh ab"
2932,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"Watching this movie is like watching everything that was good drained from it predecessor.

The martial arts scenes are unimpressive, lacking the speed and energy of the original. If the actors had much martial arts skill, they certainly don't show it. The editing in these scenes is workmanlike at best. Admittedly Peck Prior didn't have much to work with but there are several points during the fight scenes where you can't even tell what's going on.

While the sets of the original had a cool expressionist look, these had the look of a Power Rangers movie. Leonetti certainly does a lot with special effects but they just don't look very good (Motaro was pretty well done though).

Meanwhile the music track had little merit. Most of the notable musical themes were taken from the first movie."

The characters lack personality, and many, especially Motaro, are laughably lame compared to their video-game counterpa"
2936,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"That pretty much sums up MK: A. There are the bones of a decent plot here, and they had enough to work with just from sequeling off of the original movie. So what went wrong?

First of all, they lost Lambert, Ashby, and Tagawa from the first movie. That was a big shot in the foot. James Remar (who seems to have no idea why he's here, and that Raiden is supposed to be comic relief ala Raiden in the first movie) is no Chris Lambert. Chris Conrad (very briefly) is no Linden Ashby. And Brian Thompson, even though a credible screen bad guy, is no Tagawa.

Robin Shou, as charismatic as he may be, just can't carry the load. Talisa Soto, another carryover, just has nothing to do. In new roles, Sandra Hess at least does no harm stepping in for Bridgette Wilson. Lynn Williams as Jax doesn't do bad, but then he's thwarted by the plot...

Ouch, the plot. What is it, exactly? They played fast and easy with the ""rules"" in the first movie, but any sense of coherency is totally lost with this one. The fate of Earth is in the balance, but they're fighting it out in caves and quarries like something out of Doctor Who. There are three tests, but what's the third? If the bad guys don't give a damn about the Elder Gods, why the heck did they play by the Gods' rules in the first movie. Undercutting your first movie's basic concept just doesn't help you.

And the plot is just too full. Apparently Boon and Tobias, buoyed by the success of the first movie, said to themselves, ""Cool, now we can throw in all the faceless villains the marketing guys they told us would be too much for the audience in the first movie."" Whoops - this inundation of characters is too much for the audience in the second movie as well. Why is Sub-Zero a good guy, and where does he go? Who the heck is Nightwolf, and why doesn't he help save Earth other than to give Liu Kang the test(s)? What purpose do characters like Jade, Sheeva, and Montaro serve other than to provide some kung fu cannon fodder? It's like we had one good human villain (Shang Tsung) and one good F/X villain (Prince Goro) in the first movie, so they decided, ""Hey, lets put in two human villains and two F/X villains in this one.""

Which brings us to the F/X. Arrgh. There is none of the care that obviously went into the first movie, which whatever its deficiencies, at least gave you something good to look at. In the rush to kick out a sequel (barely two years), they obviously spent neither time or money.

So MK: A is mildly viewable in a martial arts/fantasy kind of way. The fight sequences are still good to look at. But the animated series, or the subsequent prequel of the TV series, is probably better to watch if you're looking for something entertaining."

2947,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"One thing all 90's kids can agree on is that 1995 brought us one of the most kick-butt movies of the decade with the release of the movie adaptation of ""Mortal Kombat""- based of course on the popular arcade games of the same name.

It was a huge hit, coming out at the perfect time to thrill audiences in a market that hadn't yet suffered martial arts and CGI overload. It boasted a fun storyline with mayhem and magic, had that amazing techno-song, was populated with likable actors and was filled to burst with tons of awesome moments. Who doesn't remember the hilarious intro to Johnny Cage, or the amazing puppetry on Goro, or the sweet Liu Kang VS Sub-Zero match?

With the game series ever-growing and expanding the mythology and the first film being such a pleasant surprise, we just knew that the inevitable sequel was gonna be bigger and better! There's no way it couldn't!

...right?

Then reality slapped us in the face with 1997's ""Mortal Kombat: Annihilation."" A film that has gone on to join the ranks of ""Batman & Robin"" and ""Speed 2"" as one of the most infamous sequels of not only the 90's, but arguably of all time. A failure that squanders all potential and destroys virtually all left-over good-will from the first movie and instead replaces it with laughable writing, strangely over-the-top performances, bizarrely dated effects even at the time and mind- blowingly bad visual direction.

Picking up immediately after the original ends, the evil emperor Shao Kahn opens a portal from Outworld and begins a process that will merge it with the Earth in six-days time, giving him total power. Now, our Earth-heroes Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, Jax and Raiden must find a way to stop this devious scheme or else the Earth will be lost forever.

That may sound like a solid enough foundation to build a movie off of, but trust me... it doesn't work. The film is beyond fractured and frankly every single scene just lumps on more plot-holes, unanswered questions and contrived pseudo-explanations in order to justify the proceedings... mainly so it can tenuously connect the constant onslaught of bad fight scenes that make up a majority of the screen time.

Director John R. Leonetti seems in over his head with this film- his directorial debut, taking over for original director Paul WS Anderson. Leonetti and his army of screenwriters are never able to find any real sort-of balance with tone, pace or style. Scenes come and go are strange intervals, humor and drama never quite gel together, and sub-plots and characters are constantly jarringly introduced and dropped without consequence or reason. The visuals are also a marked step- down from the original, with many shots being poorly thought- out and unable to be cut together competently.

There's also the issue of padding and choreography in many of the fights that lends to it all feeling very dull and forced. While the first film's action does have a slight air of feeling ""fake"" in retrospect, it can be forgiven as it was one of the first truly hit martial-arts-based films in the US. But this one just ramps up that problem, with so many unneeded flips and tricks that are thrown in to be ""cool"" and ""the bomb"", that it just feels tacky and false. By the time you see the thirtieth random backflip, you'll feel like doing some flipping yourself... flipping the channel to something else.

The performances are among some of the hammiest I've seen in a major blockbuster. The only person who really emerges unscathed is the criminally underrated Robin Shou returning to his role of Liu Kang. He's great. Everyone else? A caricature. Lynn ""Red"" Williams as Jax is a giant goofball who throws around unfunny one-liners like its nobody's business. Reiner Schöne chews the scenery as Kahn's evil father. Brian Thompson constantly SHOUTS his lines at RANDOM in an attempt to sound THREATENING as our lead villain. But of course Musetta Vander steals the show with her legendarily bad take on Princess Kitana's mother Sindel, spouting some of the worst dialog ever written with the glee of a 12-year-old on a sugar-high. It's outlandish watching her twirl and cackle and wave her arms about in her scenes... What did she think she was even doing? Was she trying to channel Ace Ventura for her role?

Add to that...

-Lowered production values (Gag-worthy green-screens and clearly rubber ""metal"" on the costumes and sets galore!)

-Shoddy costume design that looks like the actors are dressed in the Wal-Mart Halloween costumes based on the movie rather than in real movie costumes

-Wildly dated effects that looked bad even in 1997 (We're talking ""Tron"" quality CGI at times... except this was made 15 years later)

...and more and you have a recipe for disaster.

That being said, I do have to make a somewhat startling admission...

...I kinda like this movie. Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. But it's so bad, that it springs right back up as one of those unintentional ""so bad, it's kinda good"" camp classics. There's no way to hear lines of dialog like those you hear in this film (""You're alive!"" ""...too bad YOU WILL DIE!"") without howling with laughter. There's no way to see the incompetent fight sequences where people are flipping through the air like helium-filled balloons without chuckling and shaking your head. There's no way to see the awful, 80's quality digital creatures flying about without a big-old smirk coming across your face.

So, if you like so-bad-they're-good flicks... This is one for the ages!

I give ""Mortal Kombat: Annihilation"" a 3 out of 10. It's an awful sequel that effectively killed a franchise. But with some friends and maybe some booze, you'll still have a grand time tearing it apart and laughing at its sheer ineptitude."
2948,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation could have easily made the franchise into a successful trilogy of movies, but as the tagline implies, this movie destroyed all expectations.

Everything that worked in the first movie is absent here. The majority of returning characters are portrayed by new actors (with the exceptions of Robin Shou as Liu Kang, and Talisa Soto as Kitana). It also doesn't help that the acting this time around is terrible as everyone's performances range from stale (James Remar as Rayden) to over the top (Brian Thompson as Shao Kahn).

The script is riddled with plot holes, and comes off as nonsensical. The movie also follows a simple pattern; fighting, running, talking, and it goes on throughout the entire run time of the movie.

There is a lack of character development as the movie attempts to cram in as many characters from the more popular games in the Mortal Kombat franchise (mainly Mortal Kombat II and MK3), and the majority of them have limited screen-time as they either get killed off, or disappear after their 1 scene.

Of course, we have to take a look at the action, but the fight scenes are pretty lackluster this time around. We had some impressive stuff choreography-wise in the first movie, but all of the fight scenes here feel rushed.

There's an overabundance of special effects in the movie, and yet, every single one of them look terrible, even for 1997. Supposedly, this movie had a bigger budget than the first movie, and yet, it looks nowhere near as impressive. Production and cinematography- wise, the whole movie looks and feels like a cheap straight-to-video sequel rushed out to capitalize on the success of the first movie.

Mortal Kombat: Annihilation suffers the same problems as the majority of the other movies based on video games, it didn't feel like they tried to make a proper movie based on the game, but instead a product that tries shoehorning references to said game in a way that feels gimmicky, but as far as the genre goes, this stands as the worst film of the genre for being a colossal disappointment following its entertaining and well made predecessor, and a prime example of shoddy filmmaking (so much that it almost rivals anything directed by Uwe Boll).

Do yourself a favor, stick to the first movie and the video games, avoid this stinker."
2949,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is consider by many as one of the worse video game movies ever created and with good reason.

The film from the get go shows that it had no desire to make a huge impact the only impact this film has that is even close to being consider memorable is that this film just shows how a sequel can pretty much ruin a whole series.

It features some of the worse visual and special effects that can easy to be set up as a video game. I mean video games had better visuals then this film has all together.

As a fan of the first Mortal Kombat movie I will say yes that film wasn't perfect but it had at least try to make itself a hit and it was.

I consider the first Mortal Kombat to have been done right. Mortal Kombat: Annihilation does not.

The acting in the film is simply awful the cast seem that they were trying to make a bad video game and also the writing in the film is just plain bad. Also the story is really weak.

Perhaps the best thing about the film is that if you don't watch it you'll be better off because this film really don't do anything to award the viewer

I give Mortal Kombat: Annihilation an 2 out of 10"
2950,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"New Line can either be really dynamic when making exciting B-movies or extremely stupid when making sequels to success. Take a look at Son of the Mask or Blade III for examples of poor sequels. Mortal Kombat Annihilation is iron-clad proof-positive that video games with NEVER, EVER, EVER make good movies. I don't understand why they keep trying.

The first Mortal Kombat movie was FAR from brilliance. But it still had great energy, a (rather dumb) sense of humor and a really cool score by George S. Clinton crammed full of techno and trance tunes. And the fight scenes, while not graphic or breathtaking, were pure eye-candy.

This sequel is cheaper, has a different cast of no-name actors, has poor, badly shot, cut and lit fight scenes, really shoddy sets and rubbish effects. The dialogue is gut-churningly horrible and the story will make you laugh out loud with it's stupidness. Seriously, Mortal Kombat Annihilation is a definite contender for Mystery Science Theatre 3000.

Absolute horses balls from beginning to end. Everyone involved in making this film should be blacklisted and never allowed to work in Hollywood again."
2951,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"this movie was really bad for the most part even when it just came out but as a MK fan some things keep it alive. the music was awesome just like the first one and the thing I really loved was that they used a FULL arsenal of cast members from the game which was unlike the first one where they seemed to just throw in a hand full of characters and call it a day. however the problem with that is that they killed everyone off to quickly. there were characters that were dead after a punch or two. there was no threat from these characters and it was if they were no threat to humans at all even with all there powers. costumes were done really well although there seemed to be some similarities to the predator.

one thing that really bothered me about the first one was that they didn't make rayden Asian. they just figured dress a guy in a ""rayden"" hat and call it a day. now in this one its even worse. they just tried to make rayden look like Christopher Lambert. add in the short hair and u have something REALLY off.

acting was horrible also. not totally the actors fault. the script and directing were bad.

only a true MK fan could get through this movie and for those who do its worth the watch.... ONCE"

2953,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"Mortal Kombat Annihilation(1997) Review: Wow. I remember seeing this in the theater. After the fun first installment, I was looking forward to this. Perhaps my expectations were too high. That's not the only problem.

This is a very bad movie. One notable mention is the fact that only two actors from the first movie reprised their roles. That's a very bad sign alone. Christopher Lambert is not back as Raiden sucks. Lambert was good as the Raiden and the schmuck that played Raiden here looked and acted like a total flake. He cannot fill the shoes of Lambert at all. This movie also has some silly to lame action sequences. Another problem is despite the many characters here, many of them are just cameos. We only see Nightwolf for a minute and that's that. The likeness of the Kombat characters here is the only redeeming quality MK:Annihlation has got.

This movie is also unintentionally hilarious. There is a lot of cheese to fly around and lots of campy acting to be the ultimate ""B"" movie, just without the fun.

The first installment is worlds better than this. It featured a fine cast, a good story, interesting characters and a fantastic villain. Shao Khan here comes of as a club bouncer in a costume.

Now I know why many of the actors did not reprise their roles, after reading the script, would you blame them?

The Last Word: Total disaster. Mortal Kombat had the potential to be the next big movie franchise. With this, those dreams were destroyed. Pity. I would like to find the director and Finish Him! Jerk."

2957,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"For the second, and hopefully last, installment of the Mortal Kombat series I waited for the home video release to watch it since it didn't have many of the original actors, and if poor sequels with crappy replacement actors (think Major League 2) have taught us anything it's that the sequel will not only be much worse than the original, it should be a massive bomb and an unheralded disaster. But, seeing as how I enjoyed the first Mortal Kombat as a young adolescent male, I figured I'd give it a try, it would only cost me 3$ and barely 1 & ½ hours if every instinct I had proved to be right. Well, after trying to watch this film (I guess you can call it a film since it is barely feature length. but even that was too much for me since I turned it off after 20 minutes) for the first time on home video, I can truly say that it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. The sample (thank God I had the sense to turn it off when I did) was enough for me to rate it as `almost' one of my least favourite films, garnering a 2/10. Some might say 2/10 was gracious, however I've seen some truly wretched films (Not another teen movie, Batman & Robin, Caligula etc.) and I felt I couldn't give it worse since I only managed to stomach 20 minutes. I took the hit, kissed my three bucks goodbye, rated it and forgot about it as quickly as I could.

Unluckily, as fate would have it, I recently decided to make a compilation of some of my least favourite movies and rate them anew, and although Mortal Kombat: Annihilation did not make the cut it was somehow in the back of my mind. Like the memory of the aftermath of a night of binge drinking, I couldn't shake the ghastly feeling of sickness any time I though of the first viewing of the film. So when the film happened to show up on TV (who knows what the station directors were thinking when they OK'd that programming), I thought to myself `I should watch it to see if it truly does deserve to be on my list' and that `it couldn't have been that bad'. Plus I had to kill 2 hours before going out so I thought `why not?' For some reason I must have repressed more than I thought, or I just didn't get a good enough sample the first time, but in any case the full viewing of this utter waste of celluloid will haunt me for the rest of my days. I won't go into detail as to why the film is so putrid, I believe many here have already accurately recounted the many shortcomings, however I did want to mention that the film is now firmly enshrined in my top 10 worst list, having been revised down to a 1/10 (and now that's being gracious). If there's one recommendation I can make it's to not see the film, save yourself 91 minutes of pain (or if you're into S&M, pleasure), or if you absolutely have to see it (ie. you have a death wish) then bear in mind that you're in for a movie that should really have been directed by Alan Smithee, and then even he would have wanted to change his name before it was released."
2958,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"This sequel was long awaited but some of the cast changes made the tile weak and pathetic! Another star playing Raiden was not what I had in mind. But due to Lambert's vision problem, I think that would be understandable. But the action in this movie is highly unforgetable. The one who played Sabre on American Gladiators, Lynn Red Williams really fit the role as Jaxx Briggs. All AMERICAN ATTITUDE is was he put in that movie. Calling Motaro Mr. Ed was a howl. Robin Shou as Liu Kang remains unchanged. This movie would had been more successful if release timing wasn't off. But still, it is a keeper on video and DVD. Score 3.5 out of 5 st"

2964,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"In the opinion of many, the original Mortal Kombat held the distinction of being the first movie-to-vide game conversion that didn't suck.

However, where the first one succeeded, MKA one failed miserably.

With the first movie, though being a fan of the video game series helped you identify more with the characters, it wasn't absolutely critical to be able to enjoy the movie, especially if you were a martial arts fan. This is probably the biggest flaw of the second movie. A character appears seemingly out of nowhere for a fight scene and although MK fans know who they are, the general audience has no clue. Most of the characters that appear like this are either killed off in the single fight scene or disappear and are never heard from again. In a couple of instances, the names of the characters weren't even mentioned. It was a bad attempt to try and squeeze every single character from the video game into the movie. (And it's still missing some character - Kintaro and Kung Lao come to mind.)

Another huge problem with the movie is that a sequel should not require that you have watched the original in order to enjoy it and understand everything that's going on. This movie picks up the second that the original one left off and spends only about 30 seconds explaining what happened the the first movie, but someone who hasn't seen the original has no way of identifying with the characters at all, who are never really introduced because the very first scene starts with Shao kahn invading the earth.

Probably the next biggest fault of the movie is that it's missing Christopher Lambert as Rayden. Though the new guy that played Rayden tried hard, it just wasn't a good casting decision. And the other actors were pretty bad as well. The original MK certainly didn't win any awards for its acting, but the acting in this one is just plain bad for the most part.

Another problem with the movie is continuity and other such issues. A good deal of the movie revolves around Liu Kang searching through the desert trying to find a character named Nightwolf in order to 'find his animality', which is supposed to prepare him for a final battle with Shao Kahn. However, all of this was totally unnecessary, since learning his animality had no impact whatsoever on the outcome of the final fight scene. Also, we have Shao Kahn's father who is trying to destroy the earth .. we are told nothing about him, except that he is an elder god. Heck, we don't even learn his name. He says that breaking the 'sacred rules' of the elder gods to invade the earth could have dire consequences if they ever found out, but we learn later in the movie that they already know about it in the first place. WTF?

People say there's no plot in this movie, but I disagree. It's about an evil emperor of a place called 'Outworld' who tries to merge his world with ours, therefore destroying the earth in 6 days. A group of humans have to keep this from happeneing. Even though this movie is bad, I think saying it has no plot is a little unfair. (If you really want to see a movie that has no plot, watch Forrest Gump.) As for the special effects, I've never been one to judge, but they seem ok to me *shrug*

In the end, though I did enjoy parts of this movie, I thought it paled in comparison to the original. If you didn't like the original, you definitely won't like this one. If you loved the original, well .... you still probably won't like this one."
2965,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"The studio cashed in on Mortal Kombat's success. They wanted to get as much out as quickly as they could. I loved the first one. The sound on DVD is excellent! When I saw MK2 at the theatre I missed the first 15 minutes. Then I rented it - paying $3 for the first 15 minutes and I walked away. How MK fans must of been shocked by the first 30 seconds alone. 1. The egoist Cage lingering silently in the background only to make a quick ""exit"" per se, and had his glasses broken (again!) 2. Sonya Blade losing half her hair and heaving much larger breasts (no complaint there). 3. And, oh my, Rayden (no explanation necessary)

Liu Kang still has problems with his confidence? Did anyone notice how often Sonya was on her back in the movie? She also dries quick when fighting in the mud. Jax - needs therapy.

From the very beginning, you can tell you're in for something special. ""Annihilation"" is right there next to the classic ""Star Crash"". Boon and Tobias had the opportunity to really make a real mark, and they did: a big brown one on the underwear of film.

2975,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"Traditionally, movies made from videogames are crap...at best. While you might have a very hard time thinking of any good ones, horrible films like ""Super Mario Brothers"" and ""Mortal Kombat: Annihilation"" quickly come to mind. Why? Well, because videogames don't need to be deep, have much plot or even make sense if the game play is good. Here, however, as a passive observer, all the lack of substance in the game plots are obvious as you sit and watch the silliness. Think about it....this is based on a game whose only plot is people punch and kill each other!

I ahve not seen the first ""Mortal Kombat"" and the only reason I saw this one is that it's on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list...the lowest rated 100 films which have received at least 10,000 votes. This means independent and almost forgotten films aren't on the list...just the bigger named, widely distributed crappy movies.

From what I gathered, humans winning the first movie guaranteed that the Earth would be safe for like 100 or a bazillion years. However, here, the baddies from another world are back only two years later. So much for continuity. In the initial portion of the movie, they tried to explain this away to all the human characters, as they also realized the plot problem! That's clumsy. So, the rest of the film consist of some human warriors somehow overcoming Shao Kahn's evil gang of fighters.

So is this any good? Of course not...10,000+ voters aren't wrong in this case. But there are some good things about the film. For 1997, the special effects are very nice--which is important since the story is essentially ALL special effects and crazy costumes. Also, they captured the look of the game quite well. But, no the other hand, the film is simply one insane fight after another after another after another. Not much plot...and it all makes your brain very numb very quickly. In fact, after about 20 minutes of this, my brain was screaming for a break! Overall, a pretty dull film despite its almost constant action and nutty fight scenes. I simply didn't care about any of these characters and just wanted it all to stop! My verdict...just go play a videogame yourself...you're bound to have more fun."
2976,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"Mortal Kombat:Annihilation blew me away! I sat on the edge of my seat the whole way through, the anticipation was immense as i watched warrior after warrior struggle on endlessly for the championship of mortal combat. First of all the soundtrack is the best music ever, it is so catchy and alive, definitely the best soundtrack I've ever heard ever! The acting is superb in every way possible and the actors were definitely the right choice. The script is very well written and flows well. And finally the special effect were stunning, everything looked so real and alive. This movie will vividly stick out in my mind as a true masterpiece. One of the other highlights in this film is that it is more then 1 genre, for instance it is a romance, action, thriller, horror, comedy, war, sci-fi and fantasy packed into one gigantic adventure, this is the scariest film I've ever seen in my life, it is amazingly gory for its certificate.

We have no idea on who each character was just shoved in and no idea who they were. There were a lot of special effects, but way to much that they all seem to collide with each other and make what we call crap. Then even worse acting this time, and you know what else is great, not even half the cast returns but they chose even worse replacements, just when i thought it wasn't possible.

The two best actors of the first Mortal Kombat in my personal opinion were not in it (Linden Ashby as Johnny Cage and Christopher Lambert as Lord Rayden).

I can't believe they killed Johnny Cage he was my favourite character from the original Mortal Kombat, i just loved his sense of humour and his kick ass moves.

They must have been desperate for money these producers because they just didn't have the story right neither i mean sub-zero's brother? what was that about and scorpion's brother?,why milk a classic film this is a perfect example of stretching the story too far as in films such as Matrix Revolutions and Blade Trinity.

Plus the cheesy computer affects and poor acting from the characters gives this film a well deserved rating of 1, only i can't give it any lower it don't have a 0 on IMDb.

If you liked the first film don't get yourself too excited about seeing the sequel because you'll be as disappointed as i was, it ruined a classic!!

2986,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"Yep this horrible piece of garbage was not only the worst sequel and video game based movie; it was probably the worst movie ever made. I can give out hundreds of reasons why this was a terrible movie. But to save space I'm not gonna give all of them.

After the success of the original Mortal Kombat film the sequel was highly anticipated among fans. When most saw it, the film was a total disaster and a box office flop. Viewers not familiar with the games knew it was terrible b/c the recasting was horrifying, the direction was bad, the dialogue was wooden, the acting was lame, the script was poorly written, the special effects were cartoonish and the fights looked more like carefully choreographed dance routines. I think the actors were in this for just one reason, the $$$$$. I think this movie flopped because the characters were played by unknowns. I didn't know who any of them were before I saw it. Well Except for Robin Shou and Talisa Soto because they were the only actors from the original that came back for this one. Not only did they come back Shou looked like he had forgotten how to act and Soto looked like she had forgotten how to fight.

Overall the movie looked like an 85 minute Power Ranger ripoff! Most of the outfits looked like cheap costumes bought out of some Halloween shop. Most of the characters were just thrown in there for (3 minutes) no reason. It looked like their only goal was to fit in as many characters as possible without developing them. Even though they did that it felt like there weren't enough characters in the film. The fights were way too short; they were less than 2 minutes long. What was the point of going underground in those metal balls??? They looked like an American Gladiator ripoff! Sheeva and Motaro looked more like humans in costumes rather than vicious-threatening creatures. Shao Kahn looked more like a human bully without his mask. The annoying techno/dance music made it look more like a trashy music video.

The recasting on the same characters was a disaster. You got these new actors that were so not talented like the original actors. The new Rayden (James Remar) and the new Sonya (Sandra Hess) failed to bring out the appearance and portrayal Christopher Lambert and Bridgette Wilson brought into them. Sandra Hess made Sonya look more like a sluty model rather than a military woman. Lynn `Red' Williams sucked as Jax; he was a military general who talked like a street thug from the hood. Give me a break, black men in the military/army do not talk like gangsters from the hood. Rayden looked more like Sting when he gave himself that cheesy make-over.

I can go on and on about why this horrible adventure film looked more like some poor excuse to make money. For now I think you all get the point of my review.

0/5 I give a big fat 0 because I saw no effort put into this. I saw laziness and selfishness put into it."
2987,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997),3.7,John R. Leonetti,"Maybe I was expecting too much after seeing the original, I don't know. What I do know is, from beginning to end, this movie was boring. I tried; oh I tried, to find some redeeming quality about the movie. Well `what about the special effects' you might ask. You remember how the first movie looked? All the action looked like it was taking place right there. The colors were full and rich, the sets looked real. In this movie, it looked like everything was shot in one place, and the backgrounds and sets were drawn in later.

Well, you might ask next, what about the characters? Certainly the famous Mortal Kombat characters were interesting. Well, no. First, they brought back I believe 6 people from the last movie (4 good guys and 2 bad) but only two of the actors were the same. And in comparison, the new actors were pretty lame. The new characters, save for one, were never really utilized to their abilities. There was this centaur looking fellow who looked cool, but wasn't really used till the end. The woman with 4 arms, again cool looking, but not used till the end.

Well, you might ask, what about the story? Well this time instead of a mortal kombat tournament to take over the world, the bad guys invade the earth illegally. But really, does anyone go to these kinds of movies for a plot? I think the writer/director/producer thought so, because this plot wasn't explored really at all. And the writing. I can't remember the last time I heard writing so lousy. It's been a long time since I've been this disappointed in a movie. I would put the blame on the director this time. The first Mortal Kombat was exciting, and visually stunning. This one is more like the cheap crappy little brother that should have been buried in the backyard or straight to video instead of being in the theaters. Everything in this movie could have and should have looked like the first, but it didn't. Don't bother wasting your money."

It is so bad that one can wonder how on Earth did it cost 30 million dollars? Starting with the screenplay, if there was one, this movie simply has no continuity whatsoever...no storyline, no development - just a bunch of characters walking around a badly prepared stage fighting. The staging is so terrible, you probably won't see it in a high school play. It leaves you with the impression that the ""long journey"" is actually happening in a two-bedroom house. The special effects are pathetic and you can actually see the faults in something as simple as shades. Some of the fight scenes are obviously taken in front of a green screen. The acting is beyond tragic. No shocks here as nobody would expect the cast to actually act something that has no purpose and is not really going anywhere. Some of the lines are like written by a 9 year old on two beers. Tens of new characters are presented without any history or connection to anybody or anything. If all that wasn't enough, the director seems like he took a day off as some scenes include awkward pieces of body parts being focused on while the character is saying something.

Let's start with the plot, shall we? Not a lot to say about it really, other than the whole thing is a giant plot hole! It makes no sense what-so-ever, as it makes the entire first movie completely pointless. Even if it did make sense, it still isn't much of a plot. They have 6 days to save the word from total destruction. OK, whatever, not as bad as you might think, right? Wrng. The majority of the film could take place in less than a day, so I really wonder what the hell they were doing for the other 5. Stupid plot.

Moving on, I'll mention the actors. Oh God, the actors. Most of the returning characters from the first movie are replaced by new, even worse actors. I'm really glad that they killed off Johnny Cage within the first couple minutes, as that actor seemed to be the worst of the bunch. Sonja Blade's replacement was pretty awful as well, and saw fit to completely change the character.

Maybe I shouldn't be so hard on the actors. I mean, look at the script. This movie could have had Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson, but even they would have looked terrible having to say some of these pathetically cheesy lines.

One thing that I'll give this film is that it has some half decent fight scenes. Nothing spectacular, and the CGI is really bad, but at least they were mildly entertaining.

In all honesty this isn't a whole lot worse than the first film, but it is really, really bad. Id avoid it.

3000,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"Is The Avengers a good film? No. Is it the worst film ever made? No. I first saw the movie at the cinema upon its release and, at that time, I did think that it was one of the worst films I'd seen up to that point. I've watched it 2 or 3 times since then and my opinion of it has improved, well, very slightly at any rate. Apart from a pervading incoherence, I think the film's major problem is its slightness; it's only an hour and a half long and the plot is very simplistic to say the least. It's not hard to imagine audiences feeling a bit short-changed when it first came out, especially as the film was a big-budget, would-be summer blockbuster. Another big problem is the casting of Uma Thurman as Emma Peel. Thurman has shown herself to be a fine actress in movies such as Pulp Fiction but she just looks out of her depth here (I never believed in her as a top-level scientist for a second) and her English accent doesn't sound natural. Nicole Kidman, to whom the role was first offered, would surely have been better, in particular, she's displayed flawless English accents in films such as The Others and The Hours. An English actress I also think would have made a great Peel is Joely Richardson but the studio would probably have vetoed such a choice on the grounds of her not being a big enough name. Ralph Fiennes was a real enigma in this film - there was nothing wrong in principle in casting him as Steed but he looks ill at ease throughout the movie as if he'd rather be elsewhere. I can only assume he'd already twigged that the film was going to be a turkey. What's worse, Fiennes and Thurman have absolutely no chemistry between them, which wastes the snappy dialogue they have with each other throughout the film. The supporting cast fare a bit better with seasoned pros such as Sean Connery, Jim Broadbent and Fiona Shaw making the most of their underdeveloped parts. The retro-chic world of the original TV series is nicely recreated and there's no shortage of nice cars, costumes and locations but what's good about the film is easily drowned out by what's bad; The Avengers is ultimately a shallow, rushed and messy affair, severely hampered by the performances of its two leads. Handled properly, the film could have been a wonderful success for all concerned, the first chapter of an entertaining and lucrative franchise, stretching well beyond the 1990s; instead it's one of the most embarrassing flops of that decade. The original cut of the film was apparently two and a half hours long but, following negative reactions from audiences at test screenings, the studio hacked the film down to its present one and a half hour length. This doesn't actually come as much of a surprise as there is a lack of proper narrative flow to the film suggestive of chunks of explanatory scenes having been cut out. Just one example: towards the end of the film, just before they enter Sir August's underwater lair, Steed and Peel enter a phone box and Peel says ""how now brown cow?"" down the phone. The phrase seems to be a password to enter the premises but how does Peel know it? There's been talk here and there of the possibility of Warners releasing a director's cut or special edition DVD, restoring the original two and a half hour version. I think this would be a good idea and I'd definitely be interested in watching the full version of the film. It's highly unlikely to be any kind of masterpiece but it's difficult to imagine that it wouldn't improve upon the movie as it stands. At the very least you'd have to assume that it would be more coherent. Sadly I don't think the chances of Warners going down this line are high; I have the feeling that this is a movie the studio would rather forget about than draw attention to."
3001,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S.

They head to meet Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery), who is a weather specialist, but soon they discover that he wants to rule the world, using his machine that controls the weather.

I saw ""The Avengers"" in the 90's and did not like this movie. Today I have just seen it again on DVD and I found again a silly and boring movie that wastes cast and budget. It is hard to believe that Sean Connery accepted to work in this turkey. My vote is three.

3002,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"I love the Avengers. Emma Peel was a hero of my childhood. I was ridiculously excited for the arrival of this film and had nauseated all my friends when the project was first announced about who was to be our two spies. I was thrilled with the selection of Fiennes -- but Thurman? I was hesitant. Then Diana Rigg passed on being in the film. Another bad sign. Then, the television trailers, yet a third omen but I told myself the movie could not possibly be that bad. IT was worse than my wildest nightmares -- and I have an excellent imagination. Thurman was as bad as I thought, Fiennes had nothing to play to. Macnee, oh, how it could have improved if we'd seen him. I think this movie is terrible because they didn't get the joke. The Avengers is cheeky, campy, fun, and never without some form of the double entendre somewhere. Apparently, the script writes never actually saw the series and didn't get the joke. I beg, some British filmmaker somewhere give it a chance. Make your own version. Give some dignity back"
3003,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"This movie based on the popular British TV series is such a flop it doesn't really deserve comment, but here are a few nonetheless.

This is the kind of movie making that really has you wonder if you should ever visit a theater again, when you consider the waste of millions of dollars on sets, special effects and high-powered actors that could have been used for such better causes (such as, oh, say a big-screen version of ""My Mother the Car"").

At any rate, the film got what it deserved by being universally panned by critics and bombing at the box office. It was then rushed out of theaters with the bad-film strategy that relative obscurity would result in more bread at the video stores.

Considering that Ralph Fiennes (Schindler's List, Englsh Patient) and Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction, etc.) were at the top of their box-office draw potential, and with the addition of the always popular Sean Connery in a unique role as a villain, one would think that this movie would have been a sure hit. However, the potential went lightning fast down the tubes, greased by a stinky script, second-guessed editing and incompetent direction.

The best elements of the original series, namely, its charm and style, are absent. A lot of the charm came from the relationship between Steed and Peel. But Fiennes' Steed is aloof and Thurman's Mrs. Peel is cold as ice. The two appear to be sleepwalking through their respective roles, with visions of fat paychecks dancing in their heads.

Ironically, an imprudent element of the TV series that was indicative of its downhill slide after the departure of Diana Rigg (the original Mrs. Peel), namely, the introduction of the silly character of ""Mother,"" IS included in the film. Go figure.

Connery 's performance as a mastermind who can manipulate the world's weather falls flat. Like Fiennes and Thurman, he appears to be going through the motions of a script he has no faith in.

Quirky aspects of the original series that were cute and amusing have been replaced with gimmicks that are just unfunny strange and head-scratchingly bizarre. For example: the requisite cameo of an actor from the original series features only the voice of Patrick Macnee in the role of an invisible man behind a desk. What this character has to do with anything, other than adding to an already disjointed script, is anybody's guess.

On a website competently dedicated to the series it has been speculated that the director never saw a single episode of the TV Avengers. If you were any kind of fan, you will immediately observe that there is a good reason to believe this. Jeremiah Chechik's direction seems to lack any instinct for the flavor of the original series.

At any rate, with this brand of TV series-inspired movie making, you may find yourself yearning for ""Return to Gilligan's Island."" Originally hyped as a summer blockbuster, the cinematic version of ""The Avengers"" is only spectacular in its capacity to disappoint."
3004,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"Frankly, when THE AVENGERS was released, I wanted it to bomb--I wanted Hollywood to finally get the idea that ripping off old TV shows is IMBECILIC and almost never successful. Thus, I was happy that the movie did poorly and closed quickly. (I also took a trip to London just as the movie was released, and if you think it was ill-received here, the British took it times TEN.)

Ironically, though, it isn't that bad a movie. Not great, but certainly not the despicable mess that most others seem to think.

It's been called ridiculous, slow, talky, surreal. Well, what a shock, so was the original series. I've recently viewed the entire 1967 season (bought all four boxed sets), and the show is all those things at times. It is slow, generally, at a very langorous pace throughout most stories. It is talky, since most of the charm of the original was in the dialogue between characters. It was surreal, even ridiculous (The Winged Avenger, anyone? Eeee-urp.)

Uma Thurman does a passable job as Emma--she's no Diana Rigg, but who is? She plays the character smart enough, although she doesn't quite capture Rigg's regal command of situation. Ralph Fiennes, however, misses the character of Steed quite a bit, playing him as reserved, without any of Steed's charisma. Steed always had a quality about him that made you feel as if he woke up every morning feeling absolutely smashing--Fiennes seems to miss that.

The problem the film faces is twofold: Those of us who have seen the original will always compare the two, and a copy can't hope to compare. Those who haven't seen the series have no grounds to assess it on--(see some of the above user comments which begin 'I never saw the original series...')and since I think this series is not exactly vividly-remembered by the majority of the population (particularly the 18 and under movie-goers, who don't have much grasp of the nuances The Avengers operated on). Frankly, The Avengers was probably just a bad choice to try to remake

(--LIKE ALL OLD TV SHOWS. Tell me one old-TV remake that has ever spawned a sequel (which Hollywood is always sure to do when something is a success)-- only THE BRADY BUNCH...point proven?)"
3005,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"Uma Thurman's catsuits aside, ""The Avengers"" is one of the flattest movies to come down the pike in a long time.

The failing Sean Connery isn't really the villain in this movie, the true villains are a director who thought he could ""improve"" on the original, and an editor who really shouldn't have been let out of film school.

Fiennes and Thurman do an adquate job with what they were given, which wasn't much, and then the editor took half of that away.

Connery got one half-choked off rant, (all of which you see in the trailer) and then hid in the leftover set for the power supply from the floating city in ""The Empire Strikes Out"" (Er -- ""Back""). A pathetic effort from a formerly stellar actor.

Eileen Atkins was rather fun as Alice, Steed's minder, and the guest appearance by Patrick Macnee was somewhat amusing.

As for the writing, well.... I think (despite the credits) they actually gave the job to a couple of public school lads who rather thought that they were being clever.

Overall, not worth the money spent to make it, nor the $6 I paid to see it. One star, mostly for some rather nice, if somewhat generic, cinematography."
3006,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"I wasn't all that interested in watching this movie, but I decided to anyway since it was one of the only ones that week there that I hadn't seen yet. I should've saw one of the others. I don't even remember what they are now, but it doesn't matter. I am pretty sure that THE AVENGERS is the worst movie of the decade and one of my least favorite movies of all time.

John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) team up to stop Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) from destroying the planet with a weather-changing machine. I won't go into the plot too deeply, because it's just plain stupid.

The acting in this movie was not very good. Ralph Fiennes and Fiona Shaw (Father) play two of the most annoying characters in any movies that I have ever seen. The constant unwitty one-liners between Fiennes and Thurman is very annoying. Sean Connery is at his worst here. I was disappointed in him, because he is a great actor who doesn't belong in this movie. Sir August de Wynter? Just the name of the character alone should tell you much.

There was, however, one thing that was good about this movie. That would be Uma Thurman in her tight leather. I am absolutely in love with Uma Thurman, and I don't think she belonged in this film, but I am pretty sure seeing her wearing those catsuits were the only thing that kept me from having to eat my own legs and drink my own urine to survive this movie.

Maybe you'll think I'm exaggerating a bit, but I found this movie to be boring and annoying. I recommend that it be avoided at all costs."
3007,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"Warner Bros. fantasies have always had a certain memorable flare. Dating back to films like ""Superman"" and ""Blade Runner"", a viewer could always be guaranteed at least a ticket into another world. ""The Avengers"" would have been that next ""big"" thing for Warner Bros. had it not been so shoddily edited at the last minute. It should be duly noted, however, that this film had all the signs of a thanksgiving turkey: It's release date, which was moved from late June to the dog days of August. Then the fact that no press screenings have been allowed for critics. No good can come of these prophecies.

""The Avengers"", which, at best, is a second rate version of the original ""Batman"" has all the features of your top blockbuster: A Big name or two, a plethora of explosions, and enough special-effects to put ""Godzilla"" to shame. The Plot follows the exploits of the legendary secret agents John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), as they do battle with a maniacal meteorologist (Sean Connery) who has intentions on controlling the world's weather. Simple enough. Or so one would have thought. It would appear that some 25 minutes (!) was excised from the film as a result of poor test screenings. As history has told, no good comes from test screenings. As a result, the film becomes so utterly confusing that the viewer would sooner give up, rather than be insulted by a film that insists on staying one step ahead of you at all times. Only potentially good films are butchered in an attempt to make the film more appealing to youngster's attention spans. But make no mistake about it, this film is certainly not for children. Perhaps the last half hour will provide enough enjoyable action (and it does, believe me!) to distract them, but up until then the film consists of awkward dialogue, inane action (Gigantic teddy bears, anyone?), and an uncomfortable overdose of strangeness.

The cast, at one time, might have been game, but only once in a while does Ralph Fiennes even crack a smile. Thurman has apparently got the English accent down perfectly, but the only problem lies in the fact that she forgets to give a performance worth remembering. And last, but certainly not least, Sean Connery. Sadly, he doesn't even look like he wants to take over the world. Only once, in a mumbled rant, does he evoke some feelings of evil. That being said, ""The Avengers"" is a technical masterpiece. Providing the viewer with a universe of dazzling sets (that should at least be nominated for an oscar), imaginative visual effects, and beautiful costumes, one almost forgets that England doesn't look like this anymore. Unless of course, you live there. The score, composed by Joel McNeely proves to be one of the coolest scores ever produced. Inducing excitement, tension, and a little smoothness, provided by some nifty jazz notes. All of which the film is unable to do itself. For those who won't enjoy this film, it is mercifully brief. So brief to the point that it's strange. It jumps from a one hour section of the beginning to a half hour of climactic action that the viewer blinks and the movie might just be rolling into the credits. One can only hope for an improvement with a director's cut. Until then, this film should gain cult status before it makes it's way to video. Which I'm sure will be soon.

Out Of Four - **"
3008,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"This is among the most panned movies of all time since it was based on a TV show. And while I can understand the fans of the original TV show I still don't think that this movie is THAT bad. I would NEVER put it in the Bottom 100 as I can name many other movies that are much worse than this one (FREDDY GOT FINGERED, THE CAT IN THE HAT and DISASTER MOVIE for example).

In this full length version of the 1960s TV show John Steele and Emma Peel battle with a duplicate Emma Peel and Sir August de Wynter (played by Sean Connery), a mastermind that wants to rule the world with his weather-controlling machine. And while this plot could look stupid to some, it certainly is! But you can't do anything but admire the extraordinary special effects as well the sets. In particular I loved the special effects (the CGI insects were cool to look at). I personally can't give a 1 to a movie with great special effects and sets, it deserves at least other 4 points for the effects.

As for the acting, even though the movie it's bland Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are good in their roles. And it was a surprise for me seeing Sean Connery in such a nasty role and Patrick Mcnee as the Invisible Jones (a small role).

However, while the movie is a bit bad, it's watchable and far from a huge disappointment. But I am NOT saying it's great!"
3009,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"Oh, wait, that's from Get Smart, not The Avengers.

No matter. As a longtime fan of The Avengers (since childhood), I will say, right off the bat, that this movie did not fail on all levels. If nothing else, the makers of this film understood, at least, what The Avengers was about. This puts them head and shoulders above, say, the makers of The Wild Wild West movie, who had only the most rudimentary (and faulty) knowledge of what made that series an icon of popular American culture.

They might not have been successful in the execution, but they did understand what made The Avengers tick, and if the studio heads hadn't ordered extreme and desperate editing, we might have been able to see more of what the filmmakers imagined.

Two scenes stand out as perfect examples of this understanding: When Mrs. Peel tries to escape by running endlessly down an Escher-like staircase, and when Steed and Mrs. Peel walk on water in giant bubbles. Sean Connery's eccentric megalomaniac (so much more interesting than a serious, conservative megalomaniac) fit right in with the The Avenger's roster of enemies.

Whatever sense of fun the movie had (and The Avengers tv series never seemed to take itself too seriously; does anyone remember Steed being shrunk to the size of a mouse and jabbing a villain in the ankle with a fountain pen?) was destroyed when the nut jobs at the studio fell for the old ""edit out what the test audience didn't like"" trick, and put a botched film on the screen. Too bad these studio honchos have such weak nerves and such short memories; will they never learn?"

3011,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"John Steed is an agent for the Ministry; he is trained to perfection and one of the best despite his belief that the enemies of the past are no longer relevant. When a research laboratory into a weather-based defence system is blown up the main suspect is one Dr Emma Peel, although Dr Peel is adamant that she is innocent. With her being their only lead into the bomb, the Ministry assign Steed to work alongside her and use her to get to the bottom of the mystery  well, after tea anyway.

At the time of release I decided to give this film a miss as I felt I had heard too much of the critics having a field day to really be able to view it with a clear eye. Years later though I decided to give it a go on the basis that each year will see a blockbuster getting a kicking from all critics  sometimes deserved but at other time it is just a poor film that critics jump on it. However by the time I had reached the point where Sean Connery reveals his plan to a bunch of partners dressed as day-glow teddy bears I realised that things were not going to go well. Up till this point I had felt that the film was developing a nice little sense of humour that spoofs the idea of the typically English gentleman spy; however tongue-in-cheek humour is hard to do right and it is very easy to turn the film into a very silly affair that is not so much funny as it is embarrassing.

And so it was with The Avengers, a film that has some reasonable moments but is generally an unengaging and rather silly mess that can only be enjoyed as such. The problem is, this is a very expensive film for one that is just meant to be silly and it really needed to be fun, exciting and enjoyable as well, not just feature some silly points. For me the bear costumes were silly but enjoyable (it is such a weird sight that it stayed with me) but the majority of the rest of the film were just plain silly. The weather plot was poorly done and it never engaged me once.

The cast look good on paper but they are lost in the material and can do little with it. Of course in the case of Connery, it may have helped a little bit if he'd even tried, but he is poor throughout and just looks like a man getting paid. Fiennes is well cast and he is very English, it would have been a good performance had the rest of the film got the tone even half right. Thurman is not an actress I really rate and she has turned in too many average performances recently and here is no exception. Fans may appreciate her squeezed into tight costumes but for me that doesn't come close to covering a very poor performance where she gets it all wrong. Support from Broadbent, Izzard and Macnee sounds like a good prospect but really they have nothing to do and are pretty pointless in reality.

Overall this is not a laughingly terrible film, it is just lacking in any real, consistent value. Some bits are amusing but mostly it is all misjudged with the humour being too silly to work and damaging any dramatic value the film may have had. The actors are mostly poor, thanks to the material and an apparent uncertainty about what they are meant to be doing. It isn't the child of Satan or anything but I would be hard pressed to give you one reason why you should watch this."
3012,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"I've just seen this on DVD, nearly 10 years after it was made. It cost me a pound, and, aware of it's dodgy reputation my expectations weren't high. But........it's great! Incredibly stylish, amazing sets, great acting and as light-hearted and witty as the original TV series.

The two leads are excellent, and contrary to what has been claimed, do indeed have a wonderful chemistry between them. I would argue that Ralph Fiennes is incapable of giving a bad performance, and Uma Thurman is rather wonderful too. Their dialogue is very well written with quips a-plenty. Sean Connery is hilarious, and obviously relished his role as the baddie, and Jim Broadbent is equally amusing. The plot is wafer thin and zips along splendidly. I wasn't aware until I read other comments here that the film was butchered by studio executives. If that is indeed the case, I add my vote for a Director's Cut. 90 minutes was definitely too short.

The initial failure of this film at the box office was undoubtedly due to its subtlety. Understatement and tongue-in-cheek humour have never been a premium on the other side of the pond, and I imagine that in Blighty the TV series is seen through such thick lensed rose-coloured spectacles that any movie version was bound to be heretical.

Which is funny - granted that Diana Rigg played the sexiest TV character in history and that Patrick McNee was perfect as John Steed, but anyone who actually watches these old episodes will be aware of their surrealness and complete inability to take themselves seriously (hats off to the writers). These are exactly the elements that the movie version captures so well. Hats off to Mr Chechik, the director (and Canadian - significant?) After so many turgid and gloomy blockbusters (Bourne trilogy, new Bond - entertaining but not exactly a barrel of laughs) it was fantastic to discover this lost classic. Watch it!"
3013,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"Well I don't know how this one slipped through the studio system but I'm very glad it did. When I heard about an Avengers movie I assumed we'd be getting a bastardised Hollywood formula movie, and it would resemble some of the recent Bond films more than the original series. But I was thrilled to find the film had the same wonderful sense of absurdity as the show. :)

I think a lot of people are unaware this is a complete comedy. This being the case it's not surprising people think it's bad, but that's their problem. The comedy style is not a popular one, it's a particular style of generally British humour, best described as complete and utter nonsense. If you have no appreciation for absurdity, then you will NOT like this film.

Nothing in The Avengers should be taken at face value, it's all a load of s***. Steed and Peel are full of s***, that's the point. No one acts the way they do, they are both constantly trying to out cocky each other. The world of The Avengers is a place where ""small things are taken with the utmost seriousness and important things are not taken seriously at all"".

The Avengers purposely doesn't explain things, it's not supposed to make sense, that would ruin it. It's the little things in The Avengers that make it shine. Small asides from left-field that seem to go over most peoples heads.

Fiennes and Thurman are different than Macnee and Rigg, but I'm not sure they're much worse. Fiennes could perhaps have been a bit more cheerful. Thurmans whole screen presence is so vastly different from Riggs that it's impossible to compare, but I did enjoy Thurmans version of the infalable Peel. Connery going nuts was fun to see too. BTW Eddie Izzard not talking was the point of him being there, get it. Having Eddie Izzard in your movie and not having him say anything is to my mind very funny.

It's very hard to explain to people who flock to films like The Waterboy, why a film like The Avengers is so funny. Most people I guess will just never get it. I got it, and I'm glad that there ARE plenty of other people who did too. Congrats to the makers for daring to be different and convincing the studio into letting you spend $70 million.

3014,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S.

If ""The Avengers"" is a spoof, it isn't as funny or self-mocking as spoofs should be (e.g. ""Austin Powers"", or the first ""Casino Royale""). If it isn't a spoof, it is pretty inane.

Ralph Fiennes is a good actor, but he was simply miscast. He is much too meek and lacking in panache for a Secret Agent (in the movies, anyway). The special effects at the end are fairly well done, even though most of what we see is a mo"

3017,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"In spite of all the negative reviews and the low rating, I have immensely enjoyed this new version of 'The Avengers'. No, it does not replace Patrick MacNee nor Diana Rigg. But it's not supposed to, so that does not count. Yet what positively surprised me is that the film does have the flavour of the original Avengers, that it is full of understatements, and that the acting is in the - difficult - vein of what I'd call 'grotesque underacting'. Uma Thurman delivers a worthy Emma Peel with more than enough man appeal to keep me starry-eyed to the screen for 90 minutes. Mr. Fiennes combines distinction, humour and resolution in a way that is worthy of Mr. John Steed. The plot is original, yet partly predictable - but aren't all of the original 'Avengers' episodes predictable by modern audiences? Isn't a Mozart symphony predictable? Add to this the cinematography that is just delicious, and you have a real audience treat, even for those who consider themselves long-time Avengers fans like m"
3018,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"Is this going to be the next ""Gone with the Wind""? No. Is it a horrible movie with a bad script and bad acting? No!

This movie is, quite simply, fun. Fans of the hit series will be reminded of the smug attitude of Steed, although no one will be able to catch the magic between the original actors. However, the movie does well for what it is, and is quite enjoyable.

Unfortunately, it caters to a narrow range of people. Those who have never seen The Avengers might think the acting is bad or dialog poorly written. This is not the case. They are merely mimicking the style of the TV show.

Of the other hand, those who are fanatical fans will hate it because it's not as good as the TV show, and makes many changes.

But those who enjoy the show and aren't nitpicky will find this a thoroughly enjoyable movie."
3019,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"It's the cinematic adaptation from the most popular show(produced by Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell)series in England during the 60s what spread its success to United States and all the world.The film concerns about John Steed(Ralph Fiennes),a brilliant agent secret,he isn't the James Bond type, a sexist macho man but a kind spy with wide culture working for the British Intelligence and of course a charm,attractive Emma Peel(Umma Thurman),she's an elegant leather-garbed British spy with great toughness and strength.Both join forces facing dangerous and mysterious situations to save the world ,just on the edge of the sci-fi .They team up to confront against a nasty Scottish ,Sir August of Winter(Sean Connery with skirt included),a megalomaniac who wishes to rule the world by means a weather changing machine.

The picture follows the series plot by the writing credits Sidney Newman but with quite flaws .The wonderful relationship TV series among John Steed(Patick McNee) and his female partners(the gorgeous Diana Rigg,Honor Blackman,Linda Thorson,Joanna Lumney) who was subliminally funny and romantic here malfunctions and there aren't the enjoyable chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman .Appear usual character series as Mother(incarnated by Jim Broadbent and in the episodes by Patrick Newell) and strange ,odds baddies,besides a character named Father(Fiona Lewis).The classic Steed ,Patrick Mcnee, plays an invisible agent in a bemusing voice-cameo. The movie contains action,humor,tongue in check and chases as when a giant mechanic wasps attack them.The film displays a colorful and sensational cinematography by Roger Pratt.Spectacular production design by Stuart Craig and some interior halls and palaces are similarly reflected to Renee Magritte paintings. Atmospheric music by Joel Mc Neely who follows the famous theme by Laurie Johnson.The motion picture is regularly directed by Jeremia S.

3020,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"I loved it.

The opening credits alone are astonishing, and sets the tone for a vintage movie that still holds up to this day If you are expecting another Tomb Raiser, Entrapment, or Aeon Flux, think again.

The Avengers was a very hip, very surreal spy serial which carries over superbly into the movie.

Sexy, smart, and oh so Britishly prim.

I give it ten pounds, and a shilling for the way they awarded a very transparent cameo.

Avengers, you're needed."
3021,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"By no means a classic, this film does, nonetheless, find its way into my collection, and refuses to be ignored. I've watched it an amazing seventeen times, and even I cannot fully explain the attraction. I'm not the world's biggest Uma fan (I understand he's into making bad Sonny Chiba knock-offs at present), and while I admit a weakness for Fiennes and Connery, it alone wouldn't save this mess.

And a mess it is, with unexplained ventures into the absurd and a less-than-steady plot pace. But the stars put forth effort and give truly noteworthy attempts with a flagging script. The plot may be wretched, but the dialogue is clever and engaging. If nothing else, perhaps this is what makes watching The Avengers a lot like getting a visit from an witty-if-awkward friend.

If you're into the series, don't expect the polish given to that British classic, but don't be too afraid, either. John Steed still gives evil the fine, English-leather boot."

Being a massive fan of The Avengers TV series, I managed to resist watching this film for 20 years. In the end, morbid curiosity took over - just how bad could it be? The main problem here seems to be that the whole film is completely ill-judged. It's like a hotchpotch of lukewarm & half-baked ideas from the 60s TV series - thrown into a melting pot with no real love or appreciation of what made the TV series so special.

Ralph Fiennes is miscast as a foppish & smarmy Steed, and never feels like a respected and likeable gentleman from 'the ministry'. Uma Thurman fares slightly better, but there's never any real chemistry between them, and it just makes you long to see the original instead.

Why do they drink tea all the time? I don't remember that happening in the real Avengers! Predictable views of tourist London only serve to add to the feeling that someone thinks this will all make it more 'English' & please a section of the American audience who think England is still like how it was 50 years ago.

Sean Connery does a good job as the villain bent on controlling the weather with his elaborate machine (nods to the episode 'A Surfeit of H2O' here), but the whole Bond-like epic climax falls flat, & goes down the drain faster than rain in a rainstorm.

This whole ludicrous film feels contrived, unreal, charmless and cartoonish. Its only purpose seems to annoy & confound long-standing Avengers fans, and to bore contemporary cinema watchers who now probably wonder what all the fuss was about."

I am not making that up. I had already known about this from the Nostalgia Critic's review, but I was still pretty shocked when I saw it! This features some organization that doesn't allow women in their ranks.

That's kind of odd, seeing as how one of their leaders is a woman...who is named ""Father""...for some reason? The special effects are quite bad, especially the giant insects (yeah, those are there too). I admit to knowing virtually nothing about the original TV show.

The interesting question to me 20 years later is not how bad it was, but why it was so bad.

It's not the fault of the people in front of the camera, all more than talented enough to pull this off. I'm not inclined to blame the people behind the cameras either. The movie is competent enough at a technical level. Though the script, direction, and camerawork were all lackluster, that just makes a film dull, not terrible. No, I think the responsibility for this one is ultimately the Hollywood system as it existed in the 1990s. Studios imposed a lot of requirements on any film which was going to be marketed as an action blockbuster. Chase scenes, big special effects set-pieces, explosions, Sean Connery's name on the marquee, more chase scenes.

The Avengers (TV series) is not action, the draw is the amiable, flirting but non-romantic interaction between the lead couple, the sixties glamour and charm, and lightheartedness mixed in with campy international intrigue.

I'd say that The Avengers (movie) got Micheal Bay-ized except that's being unfair to Bay. He made Pain and Gain after all so we know even he can manage stylish humor, at least of the sardonic variety.

Nope ... this movie is just dead. An assembly-line commercial product with no redeeming qualities. All the interesting and fun things cut out, nothing of value added in."

Good fight scenes, an average car chase and the main thing: 1960's Madness! The storyline makes little sense i will agree, but it is mad! Back in the 60's would it have been possible for mechanical wasps? would you have had an underwater island? a weather control machine? Pointless treasure maps lying about the place?

I'm too young to remember the original series all that well, but I do recall watching it in reruns when I was a little guy. And let me ask you, what young kid, on the cusp of manhood, wouldn't have dropped their jaws at the original Emma Peel?

Unfortunaly, I don't think that many other people my age feel the same way I do about the series, so I can understand why this bombed in theatrical release. But thanks to video, I hope this film will catch on as a cult hit.

What did I like about it? Well, I thought the campy tone fit the silly feel of the original series quite well; Also, the idea of an unbrella as a weapon of destruction just seems cool to me; Plus, Uma Thurman certinaly isin't Diana Rigg, but she's not exactly hard on the eyes either.

Please don't listen to the critics on this one. If you like Austin Powers or are just discovering the joys of the old spy flicks, you'll enjoy this one.

Ralph Fiennes gives a brilliant performance as debonair, derby-wearing Agent Johnathan Steed, and Uma Thurman also is at her best as his lovely but lethal civilian counter-part Mrs. Emma Peel.

Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"I am amazed at how well an American film has captured the matter-of-fact surrealism which the mathematician Dodgson(Lewis Carroll)gave to his dream-child, Alice, as also it recalls the more knowing, and oh-so-polite deconstruction wrought by the media-saavy British children of the 60's upon the distressed remnants of England's Imperial aplomb!

Of course, as Oscar Wilde may not have said, Satire revisited is only a lukewarm cup of tea. But then nostalgia - especially when the satire was so gentle anyway - has its own charms. And there was, anyway, a hefty dose of nostalgia amidst the cool insouciance of the original. Its very modernity was made to seem almost an expression of polite insistence on whatever surreal manifestation of tradition was encountered. It was the utterly unruffled mien of the original which prevailed over all lapses from reason and good taste. So, at its best, in the new cinema version.

This is indeed a brave try by Hollywood to draw us back into that black-and-white psychedelia of swinging sixties British commercial television. The sheer madness of the enterprise almost works - if the money-men hadn't had cold feet at the last minute, we might have been enjoying a really remarkable fantasy film. As it is, we must content ourselves with a merely very amusing piece of whimsy. Even through the plot-holes left by a nervous editor we can see some wonderfully mad logic at work: The Escher-inspired architecture of the baddy's stately home, in which Mrs Peel at one point loses her way, encapsulates this whole dream-trip of a movie.

And for those who don't 'get it', I can only say, Humour is like that: Very dependent on individual taste.

But even allowing for taste, it is a sad reflection on public taste that 'The Avengers' overwhelmingly offends filmgoers who are probably quite prepared to accept the ever more overblown superheroes of a more violent tradition, such as 'Batman' or 'The Hulk'. Of course, these two are clearly representative of that particularly adolescent taste for the extreme and crude for which the contemporary Hollywood production-line largely exists. (There is every sign that Eddie Izzard's character was originally intended to satirize mega-buck entertainment and mega-buck villains as being really just spoiled brats with their expensive toys.) The genteel quirks of the English-inspired concept of 'The Avengers' are - in their essence, and however silly - just too irritatingly grown-up for such hyperactive youth ever to endure sitting still for!

A pity the film was not left alone upon release to find its own friends - like a stray cat, that will carefully choose whom it will exercise it's feline charm upon. And what more feline than Uma Thurman in Mrs. Peel's cat-suit?!

This is certainly not the sort of film to toss into an auditorium full of baying first-run morons.

But I suspect that it is a film with more than one life ..."
3033,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"The movie was truly enjoyable - it should of course be taken with a pinch of salt. The blending of futuristic technology with 30s decor is stunning. It reminded me of a comic-strip brought to life - the reason for what may seem like 'overacting'. And I love Sean Connery, even as the vill"
3034,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"As a mild fan of the original series, I was looking forward to this film. Luckily it didn't disappoint. Lying somewhere between Bond and Austin Powers, The Avengers, for mine, captures the best elements from both.

Stylish to the extreme, The Avengers never lets trivial things like plot and reality get in the way of having a good time. Steed and Peel seem more interested in where the next cup of tea is coming from, than saving the world from a diabolical baddy.

The protagonists are provided wonderfully by Fiennes and Thurman. Not so much like the originals, but rather exaggerated versions of them. With their arch delivery and restrained manner, it isn't so much about what they say, but how they say it. Both cut stunning figures in (and out) of various costumes. Their roving eyes are subtle but unmistakable.

Connery turns up for over-the-top bad guy duties and relishes the chance to act like a complete loon. When uttering such priceless gems as; ""one should never fear, being wet"", Connery is as strangely disturbing as he is funny.

As previously mentioned, The Avengers is on style overload. This is provided across the board from the polished cinematography to the snazzy music. Check out the marvellous credit sequence, for just a taster.

Trouble only strikes the film, when as Hollywood necessitates, the climatic fight between Fiennes and Connery comes around. In reaching for big spectacle, the result is unfortunately sluggish. The charming closing scenes recover what was lost however, and left me thirsty for more.

The Avengers has certainly proven to be a film that doesn't please everyone. The public and critics alike, unsure how to take it's quirky, low-key nature, have reacted with vitriol. But as the many wise and thoughtful comments on this message board (in amongst the inane) prove, there is an audience for this film. An intelligent audience, that will be enjoying this film long after the majority of vacant, big budget, Hollywood nonsense has been forgotten."
3035,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"The Avengers is based on the classic 60's TV series of the same name, which starred Patrick Macnee as well-dressed gentleman secret agent John Steed, and Diana Rigg as his cool, athletic and deadly partner (Mrs.) Emma Peel. Fiennes and Thurman take on the roles for this long awaited big-budget revamp.

The year is 1999, and the sixties have never ended. When the Prospero Project, which aimed to control the country's weather, is destroyed, all evidence points to the culprit being Dr. Emma Peel, a leading physicist at the institute. The Ministry's top agent, John Steed, is assigned to investigate. Accompanied by Mrs. Peel, they discover a terrible plan concocted by a diabolical mastermind

Firstly, this film is nowhere near as bad as most critics have said it is. It is fairly disjointed, but that is only because Warners' executives ordered frantic last-minute editing to `pace it up'. They obviously didn't understand the basis of the film, as the utter Englishness and strangeness is part and parcel of the whole concept. Fiennes and Thurman are superb as the leads, although the former is a little too young. The script by Don MacPherson (who like the director and producer is a long time fan) is first class, and the direction is outstanding with Checick capturing to perfection the surreal weirdness that the series is famous for. But it is Sean Connery, as loopy meteorologist Sir August DeWynter, who steals the show. He bounds through the film in overdrive, nutty as squirrel droppings, running off with every scene. Connery is obviously having a ball.

The movie is a perfect addition to the series, with all of its strengths and only one small concession to Hollywood (I'm not saying what). It is definitely the best film of the year so far: exciting, funny, suspenseful and highly enjoyable. Just one thing though- don't take it too seriously. When you see our two heroes being chased along country lanes by giant robot wasps, you'll know it's all just a bit of fun.

P.S. I don't care what you send in e-mails, or if you firebomb my house, because this film is brilliant and I'll take you all on, in a group or one by one, to prove it!"
3036,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"Whenever the movies The Avengers or Batman and Robin are mentioned the most likely reactions are telling of someone who has seen and feels burned by what they saw (until recently myself included). That the two of these films star Uma Thurman is unfortunate. However, I would argue that The Avengers isn't all that bad. Having recently viewed some of the original television series I have come to appreciate what was attempted with the movie.

This movie's tag-line is 'Saving the world in style' and that's precisely what it does. The Avengers is not a rough-and-tumble James Bond or Mission Impossible type action-adventure but a retro-stylish tongue-in-cheek jaunt through the marvelously preposterous diabolical schemes of an over-the-top madman. The tongue-in-cheek humour grates on most viewers but it is essential to this particular film in that it honours the source material wonderfully.

The casting of Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman is spot on, the overt double entendres between them is light and playful and they handle it with aplomb. The supporting cast is filled with wonderful character actors from Britan and Ireland including the likable Jim Broadbent and the delicious Fiona Shaw. Original TV series star Patrick Macnee makes an inventive cameo appearance.

If the film falls short in any way it is with Sean Connery. He is never presented with enough material to chew upon, and my only guess is that (seeing as it is a relatively short film) some of his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor.

That said, I think the film delivers precisely what it set out to do. That audiences stayed away and fans balked is a shame as it is a gloriously retro, stylish yet restrained romp. The opening title sequence is superb, the music fits perfectly and scenes such as the climactic inflatable ball river-walkers could have been iconic.

Worth a look, in the right mood. I suggest watching some of the original episodes first. This is no action movie clone... Makes you wish it had been a success to see where they would have gone with a sequel."
3037,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"On it's own, this movie is a little odd, but not un-enjoyable.

The biggest problem with this movie is that it was advertised as a ""Bond-Like"" action thriller - which it isn't.

This movie simply failed to satisfy every target audience they had.

Fans of the TV series weren't happy with anyone besides Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee in the staring roles.

Anyone who wasn't a fan of the TV series was miss-lead into thinking they were seeing a ""Bond-style"" action movie and couldn't figure out what they were given instead.

If you enjoyed the silliness of the TV series (especially the later coloured ""Emma Peel"" episodes) and aren't so tied to Diana Rigg (Is anyone really all that tied to Patrick Macnee?) then you'll probably enjoy this movie.

Just relax and enjoy - don't ask ""WHY"" too much."
3038,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"I know that this isn't much in the way of an ""in-depth"" review, but the experience of seeing this film was too painful to dwell on in depth, so here goes.

This piece of tripe stole 2 hours of my life which I will never be able to retrieve.

I only hope that any fans of the fantastic TV series will be able to wipe the memory of watching this farrago from their memory.

I can say, in all honesty, that I have never had such a painful movie-watching experience in all my time on this planet.

This film is the work of Satan - that's all I have to say on the subject...

Watch at you own peril!"
3039,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"A complete mess, a film that makes little sense. Don't bother with it, even the great Sean Connery can't save this trash. Uma Thurman strikes again after the equally awful Batman and Robin, though she does at least look great. Ralph Fiennes is even more boring and wooden than he normally is. Rubbish, rubbish, rubb"
3040,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"Yes, this movie is ""that"" bad! I can usually find something interesting...something funny in every movie...

And the fact that Sean Connery was in this movie, and not even HE was any good just adds to the confusion.

The screenplay is more incoherent than ""Freddy Got Fingered""--a horrible movie also, but at least it made me laugh a few times.

The characters are less interesting than those in ""From Justin to Kelly""

This movie is almost like a ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" but with modern special effects.

This movie wins my personal award for the ""most unwatchable."" Meaning, although I advise people to watch movies I might consider ""bad"" for themselves....PLEASE trust me...don't even bother. :)

I can barely remember any of it, it's a memory my mind is trying to repress.

My all-time ""worst"" movie award goes to Tom Green's ""Freddy Got Fingered."" But it's such PURE trash, parts of it are actually worth seeing....I don't know why...but it is. Maybe it's just because he acts so stupid it holds your interest. :)

Please do not rent this movie...patiently wait for it to be broadcast, or if you happen to see it on cable, I DARE you to sit through the whole thing w/out a burning desire to either fall asleep or change the channel! 'Cause if you rent it, you'll demand your money back. :-P"
3041,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"To cut it short, I love this movie.

The actors to a great job. Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes are quite convincing, and Sean Connery is fun to watch. But that's not the point. You have to watch this movie for the right reasons. I like it so much because of the atmosphere. The visuals are just amazing and fun to watch. The surrealism of every single scenery is a pure pleasure to watch. Streets are always empty, there are hardly any people ever. Gadgets are weird yet working and look quite outlandish, the storyline propels making no real sense, and it's all like one big sophisticated funny stylish dream. Don't even try to follow the story too much. Enjoy the dialogue with its dry wit, humor one could righteously call british. Watch the settings and enjoy the details and the atmosphere the movie builds up, and get dragged into that world. You have to turn off your head partially though, but it's a welcome release for me anytime i watch it. I would really enjoy the original 2.5 hour version, maybe we'll get to see a directors cut sometimes, although that's highly unlikely."
3042,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"""The Avengers"" is one of the biggest money-losers of the decade. I've read estimates that it lost $40,000,000...and with a film this clumsily and expensively made, I can certainly understand it. Initial previews went disastrously for the studio and they had the brilliant idea of trimming 26 minutes from the movie. Unfortunately, this made the film choppy and incomprehensible...and audience members stayed away in droves. So why did I decide to watch it? It was simply too infamously bad for me to resist it!

The plot is a confusing mess involving a duplicate Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) and a guy who can apparently control the weather (Sean Connery). But the characterization of these and all the people seemed unimportant and everyone in the film lacks depth...and you have no idea WHY they do what they do. Instead the film focuses heavily on overly mannered dialog (to the point of being incredibly annoying), lots of expensive stunts (something never seen in the original TV show) and gadgets (such as giant robotic wasps, an invisible agent as well as a board meeting where EVERYONE is inexplicably dressed like the Grateful Dead bears...also the sorts of thing not seen in the TV show, thank God). Clearly, the folks who made the film had a severe lack of reverence for the source material...which would irritate the die-hard fans. And, the incomprehensibility and constant style over substance would certainly irritate all the rest of us! This is an expensive looking film which just doesn't make much sense, isn't entertaining and substitutes stunts and gadgets for plot.

So, is it as bad as its reputation? Perhaps not...but dollar for dollar, you'd be very hard-pressed to find a film that delivers this little for the dollar! It's wastefully bad...and about as much fun as a case of the Shingles."
3043,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"The Avengers is possibly the worst movie ever, if you are reading this and have not seen movie then I strongly advise that you don't see it, the first half is boring and so is the second. When I hired this I thought that it wouldn't be fantastic but it would be OK, I was dead wrong, it was terrible. The avengers was boring and the villain was probably the worst villain EVER! He was someone who had a machine that could control the weather, how unthoughtful.

The story was absolutely terrible and the acting was extremely poor, I don't mind any of the actors in this movie but this was them at there worst. From 20 minutes in to the film I wanted to take the DVD out but I couldn't bring my self to do it.

I believe that mixing a British spy movie with a movie involving super villains is just an absolutely terrible movie, the audience would rather watch James Bond or Spider-Man. I also do not like the idea of having a British super villain (no wonder the villain could only control the weather).

In conclusion, The Avengers is boring, lame, pointless, what ever you want to call it but just don't hire it."
3044,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"One would think that combining Ralph Finnes, Uma Thurman, and Sean Connery, you could get a pretty decent movie out of it. Am I right? Well it just so happens that these three great actors have come together to form one of the worst movies ever made! This is no joke!

There is a scene where they all dress up in teddy bear suits. TEDDY BEAR SUITS!!! The great Sean Connery, James Bond himself in a Teddy Bear suit. It's madness! This isn't worth renting, buying, or even talking about. With a very thin plot and nothing to really hold onto, this movie was horrible. It's a disgrace to the movie industry. Shame on you Jeremiah Chechik. Shame on "
3045,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"This has got to be one of the worst movies of all time, there is not one thing moderately OK with this movie. What a waste of a good cast as well (Sean Connery, Uma Thurman, Ralph Fiennes, Jim Broadbent). Sean Connery is, I'm afraid to say, pretty awful as well as the special effects (Even Doctor Who can come up with better, and that is saying something!)

Sean 007 Connery plays a whacked out weirdo, Sir August de Wynter (Who in the hell would have a name like that) who plans to destroy the world with a weather machine, or something like that.

Please for your own sanity miss this one out and whatever you do, do not waste any of your precious pennies buying this junk. To be honest I wouldn't even give it 1 star out of 10."
3046,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"I felt forced to write a comment on this movie, because I had previously found it on the top list of worst movies of all times. I still believe it was a nice try, good actors, good acting and lyrically beautiful! I guess most people who had seen this movie concentrated too much on the plot, which actually doesn't really exist, but the movie is not about a possible interesting plot. The movie Avengers entertain us in a different way, it is more like a theatrical piece on the big screen. I really enjoyed the spoken words in the movie, poems replaced conversations. And all this lingual beauty put in a colorful, amazingly well-made, painting-like cinematography. This movie is like indulging ourselves in the world of beautiful paintings and colors, and literature at the same time. So who cares about any p"
3047,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"First of all, I have seen the series and have always been a HUGE fan of it. I was very excited when it was announced many, many years ago that there would be a cinematic adaptation of 'The Avenger' (back then, they were talking about Mel Gibson and Nicole Kidman).

When I saw the movie for the first time, I looooooooooooooooooooved it. There! I don't freaking care about all the negative criticism this film gets because most of the time it's from people who have never seen the series in the first place.

The original Avengers was done with a very very small budget. Because of that sets were very simple (but extremely original), there were no extras or backdrop actors (London always seemed deserted) and some of the actors came up with their own costumes (like Patrick MacNee). The stories were always extravagant and brilliant. The wit and the humor very British.

'The Avengers', the movie, captured that oh so typical Avengers style and feel. Mrs Peel drives through a deserted British capital, the villain is extravagant, the sets colorful and original, etc....

Although the story has big holes (huge scenes were just edited out) I still enjoyed it. The cinematography is fantastic (just like one big Magritte painting), the music super cool and the actors did a good at recreating one of the best tv series in television history ....

So stop reading all those bad reviews and go see this movie!!!"
3048,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"I'm not sure why so many people hated this movie. I guess because it's not particularly serious, or because of its clever sense of humor. This movie is not full of nude sex-addicted women and muscular ultra-cool men; I guess a lot of people want that sort of stuff in their movies. I, however, do not. I truly enjoyed this movie. It was funny and clever and well-made. Uma Thurman is absolutely stunning. I knew she was pretty, but in this movie she is incredible. The other actors are quite good, too. All in all, a movie for people with an odd (or British) sense of humor and fans of Uma Thur"
3049,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"If you have ever seen the 1960's series ""The Avengers"" after which this movie is fabricated, you will note that the original had charm, charisma, and a touch of mysticism.

The Avengers(1998)has not even a moment of fortunate nuance.

A lot of guys are ga-ga about Uma Thurman. This is mainly because she has long legs, and is frequently naked in her various films. Her most famous parts have been short, and very uncomplicated. As Emma Peel she is brutal. The original Mrs. Peel, played then by Diana Rigg , possessed a kittenish, yet lethal sexuality,all the while exuding intelligence and mystery as she spoke. Rigg's Peel was art, in vaguely arty times.

Thurman's Peel suffers from an uncomfortably affected British accent. Frankly, even without this impediment, Uma is just not up to the task.

Hollywood often tries to bolster bad scripts and bad ideas with what is often referred to as, T&A.

The Avengers is unique in that you can find bad writing, bad acting, and bad production, all in one expensive package. Unfortunately it is not bad enough to be camp."

There's literally nothing redeemable about this movie. It has no idea what it's tone is, it jumps from scene to scene in ways that make Micheal Bay seem restrained, and the writing is just... so... BAD...

Whose bright idea was it to cast Eddie Izzard and have him never speak?! That's like casting Gene Kelly and having him not dance or sing, or casting Matthew McConaughey and having him keep his shirt on. Speaking is what he DOES.

Bad guys in bunny suits? --- and some clever dialogue. I'm sure it's one of those movies where you'll find something new every time you watch it again. There is a bit of James Bond, Harry Potter and Batman. The effects are great. I've never been able to figure out just where Ralph Fiennes fits.

Really surprised by the low rat"
3055,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"As it turns out, the one group of diabolical masterminds that `The Avengers' can't outwit is film editors.

Still, despite its well-documented flaws, this movie doesn't quite deserve the peasants-with-pitchforks-and-torches reception that it got from fans of the 1960s British TV series.

For those who come to it with no expectations, well, your expectations won't necessarily be exceeded, but there are some fun bits. The movie version is as mindless as typical Hollywood summer action fare, but no worse.

First, the good news: screenwriter Don MacPherson does draw on a wealth of wacky plot points from the series; like that show, the movie does have stylish fashions and sets; it doesn't take itself too seriously.

But the heart of the show was the rapport between Patrick Macnee, playing suave agent John Steed, and his various leading ladies. In Cathy Gale, the brisk, buxom Honor Blackman created a leather-clad woman warrior who was still a feeling person. With her fashion-model figure and classical theater background, Diana Rigg made Emma Peel the ultimate in intelligence and charm. Voluptuous Linda Thorson was perhaps too young, but she brought a combination of physicality and bubbliness to Tara King.

Macnee provided graceful support to these three very different actresses, and the show arguably reached its height during the black-and-white Diana Rigg season. While Rigg made an arch, androgynous Emma Peel, her chemistry with Macnee produced role models for female-male relations.

It's a difficult formula to emulate, and there may have been worse choices that Ralph Fiennes as the movie Steed. The Rock comes to mind. But while Fiennes is attractive and seems kindly off-screen, on-screen he generates all the warmth and charm of week-old bath water.

And while Macnee did as few stunts as possible _ as even a cursory glance at a TV episode clearly shows _ he at least looked formidable. Fiennes looks like a gust of wind would blow him away _ unfortunate, considering the film's weather-related plot.

In contrast, the athletic Uma Thurman creates her own special effect as Emma Peel. Her dangerous curves seem to defy the laws of physics, filling catsuits in ways that the underendowed Diana Rigg couldn't imagine, much less match.

And Thurman's Emma starts out well, with her early scenes providing much of Rigg's breezy playfulness. Alas, the more time she spends with Fiennes, the more she mimics his mumbling, diffident performance. As the scenes jump around almost at random, Thurman's version of Emma becomes equally fractured.

Sean Connery gives a one-note performance, and one wishes that only dogs could hear him. Of course, the choppy editing doesn't give him a chance at grace notes. The megalomaniacs on TV episodes were often eccentrics in a script filled with eccentrics, with highly personal grievances and plots.

The movie lacks those charming supporting characters, and in this underpopulated movie, Connery is the obvious bad guy right from the start. Still, even if the cast is adrift, there is some genuine feeling between the Steed and Peel characters. It's a pale copy of the Macnee-Rigg pairing, but one suspects there was a better movie here that got derailed on the Hollywood assembly line."
3056,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"Back in the 1960's, Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg made their roles in the British TV series ""The Avengers"" seem interesting.

3057,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"Just back from the theatre... Wow. What a waste of $7. Not only was the movie seemingly lacking a director, but you know that James Bond could kick John Steed's a** any day of the week - even without an umbrella! The movie , however, seems to hail the Bond films by referencing the best scenes of Goldfinger and Diamonds Are Forever, but not as well done as the originals. Sean Connery, even with a short on-screen time, has a well-rounded plot figured out. Unlike SPECTRE's well-thought out intents, however, Sir August deWinter lacks a motive! The writers, seemingly aware of the eventual demise of the script, apparently decided to perform a literary euthanasia - adding random physics jargon to explain a natural impossibility , introducing an invisible man who relates to the plot in no way whatsoever, and also keeping the dialogue uninteresting, dry, and pointless. In fact, the movie might have had a G rating if it had not been for one use of a disagreeable word edited in during post production. If one ever rents this movie, it would be a much more agreeable experience if one turns the volume down and the screen off. Even Roger Moore makes a better British agent than Ralph (Ray?) Finnes, who is an excellent but poorly cast actor. ""The Ministry"" could never stand up to Her Majesty's Secret Service, which is probably why the actors in the original Avenger's series (much better than the movie) eventually turned to the Bond camp. In short, a good intention killed by studio requisites."

The plot is a jumbled disaster including huge bear suits that are never explained or justified. Also a cleverly placed F-word really didn't fit, and was also in bad taste.

But crap it sucks. The whole heart of the TV show was the tension between the agents. Thurman and Fiennes look like they filmed their lines on separate days and then dialogue scenes were pasted together later by a hermit who hadn't heard a human conversation in years. The dialogue was either so badly written or poorly spliced together that frequently it seemed they were talking right past each other, tossing out non sequiturs at each other like popcorn.

The plot and action of the film were obviously butchered beyond repair. Unless one has the attention span of someone on a very good marijuana high, the vast gaps in the narrative and even the action sequences will become very irritating. I would like to imagine that this was a good movie pruned into a mediocre movie by studio trolls, but this strikes me as wishful thinking. My guess is that the bare 90 minutes (boy does it feel longer than that) was the least crappy stuff they had to work with. The rest of it was probably just more unexciting chase scenes, unconvincing umbrella tricks, wooden Fiennes, Sean Connery yelling with a big stupid grin on his face, flat jokes, and so on.

I can't believe they cast Eddie Izzard and gave him almost nothing to say. Better than his completely silent role in Mystery Men I guess.

I gotta give The Avengers this though, Uma Thurman looked devastating.

Not worth it - not even for MST3K purposes."

3065,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"The Avengers is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do not think I have ever been so bored with a film only an hour-and-a-half long. Neither Fiennes or Thurman capture their characters like MacNee and Rigg did in the original series. They rather spend the whole film throwing mindless banter at each other in order to see whom is the colder of the two.

Sean Connery could do no right in this film. I wish he had been smarter and stayed away from this project the moment he read the script. The scene with the teddy bears will forever register in my mind right up there with the fight with Robert Shaw in ""From Russia With Love"" or the laser scene with Gert Frobe in ""Goldfinger."" Why Mr. Connery? Why?

One can fully understand why Warner Bros. went through such length to keep this film from being seen by critics before it was fully released. The script is awful, the characters uninteresting and the finale laughable. After all, no one in their right mind gave a damn as to whether Sir de Winter actually did control the world's weather. I'm sure all the armies in world wouldn't stand a chance against a very sensitive machine. Yeah, right.

This movie stands no chance of getting any kind of recommendation.

Stunningly misguided and incoherent disaster ""based"" on the 60s British television series finds Ministry agents John Steed (Feinnes) and Emma Peel (Thurman)--in name only, the both--pairing up to thwart a madman (Connery) with a machine that controls the weather. If the script contained traces of the original program's English drollery and class, they've been pressure-blasted to vapor by all the off-putting polish and noise pollution; all of the stars (but especially Fiennes) are miscast and look utterly lost with the senselessly miscalculated material. Its intermittent sheer weirdness--a board meeting of teddy bear cosplayers??--might make it seem primed for cult status, but this turkey's too much an erratic bore for even that dubious honor. Patrick MacNee, the original John Steed, makes a vocal cameo as an invisible agent.

3068,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"I'm sure Sean Connery got some big bucks to both play the villain and pump some box office life into this big screen adaption of the British series The Avengers which got great ratings syndicated on this side of the pond. Several people were in the cast at one time or other, but the years of Patrick MacNee as John Steed and Diana Rigg as Emma Peel are what is remembered best.

Playing those parts and totally failing to channel the charm of the dialog of the charming Steed and the beautiful martial arts expert Mrs. Peel are Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman. These two are on assignment to find out who is blackmailing the world's governments with a climate control device. Dark clouds are over London literally.

It's Sean Connery former MI5 guy retired and the only time this film has some life in it is when he comes before Parliament in full tartan regalia. I guess proud Scot Sean Connery always wanted to do that and he got his wish here.

I believe it was supposed to be campy, but it's just dry. There's no chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman. And why do they talk in that monotone drone?!? I stuck it out, but it's one of the few times when I really felt like the time spent watching a movie was a complete waste. Yikes. The story itself is pretty non-existent, too. It's like a string of cliché spy and action movie scenes strung together. It's actually hard to believe it's a major studio release with big name act"
3070,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"This big-budget flop is not without its good points, seeing as it contains enough offhand weirdness and odd situations to appeal to most bad movie fans. Although its about as far away from the original television series as you can get, there's this retro '60s thing going on with the film which makes it pretty amusing to watch. Although the fact that the cast members are obviously taking everything as a joke does get on your nerves after a while, I consider this to be an enjoyable failure and I must admit that I pretty much enjoyed some of the individual scenes.

You know you're in for a crazy time with the film's opening, which sees Steed walking down an apparently normal English street only to be attacked by a number of surprise assailants. For example, at one moment a whistling milkman smashes two empty bottles together to use them as weapons as he lunges as Steed. This exceptionally odd beginning sets the campy tone for the rest of the film, which is not for all tastes it has to be said.

Packed with cheesily overemphasised dialogue, lots of one-liners and innuendos worthy of a Bond movie, THE AVENGERS has the benefit of a huge budget to include lots of nifty (but hardly convincing) computer effects. These include an attack by a swarm of mechanical bees, characters walking in see-through bubbles and the climatic ""storm within a building"" scene which is sufficiently loud and over-the-top enough to be a crowd-pleasing event. Elsewhere, we have the ever-odd Eddie Izzard as a mute henchman, one of the least threatening ever to grace a cinema (or television) screen, and bad guys dressed up as giant multicoloured teddy bears in order to disguise their identities.

Ralph Fiennes (looking a lot like a young version of Peter Cushing) essays the role of the straight-faced John Steed, and is pretty good; Uma Thurman plays the leather-suited Emma Peel: one wonders why she agreed to be in such a fantastic movie again after the failure of BATMAN & ROBIN but I guess she's a glutton for punishment. Sean Connery is the non-threatening chief villain, and has had enough experience with Bond villains in order to know how to play it, but his performance is somewhat weak. Elsewhere, we have Jim Broadbent as the wheelchair-bound Mother, leader of the agents, and a funny turn from Patrick Macnee as an invisible agent (!).

The major problem is the obvious cutting that went on with the film after initial test screenings, which undoubtedly make events confusing at times. In my mind this just adds to the weirdness. See it for yourself to find out how."

Why?

Start with the Producers culling it down to an 80m (Excluding Titles) film, the film left is unevenly paced and minus back-story elements that would have helped.

It's still stylish and has moments of pure Avengers-ness but...here we must mention the leads...

The Dialogue between them want's to ape the wit of the best Steed/Peel shows but ends up stilted and filled with lines that Benny Hill would have shook his head at. The Trust between them changes from scene to scene and they have no Chemistry.

Ralph Fiennes plays Steed stiff upper-lipped and that's all...

Uma Thurman looks like a wax doll (She still manages to be sexy despite this) and is robotic at times.

Sean Connery is Sean Connery but given little to do and again his Back- story (The portrait of Emma...) isn't given.

Eddie Izzard could be played by anyone and his last words (Oh F**K) is so badly dubbed as to be an insult.

It does entertain despite this and maybe in a 'Directors cut' could be reevaluated, but I can't see Warners ever doing it.

3076,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"I rewatched The Avengers today and it really is a missed opportunity. The reason it failed was not IMO the surreal wackiness, it was that Warners panicked and cut huge chunks out of the film rendering it not only surreal and weird, but missing links in the story that would have tied all the bizarre stuff together better.

If you look on Wikipaedia it details what was in the original script, such as the attack on the secret base by the evil Emma Peel that was seen in trailers. I also recommend reading the novelisation, which you can pick up for a couple of quid. It really is absurdly stupid how Warners had, judging by the book and screenplay, a great film and then they decided 'instead of a long movie people might like, we'll cut it down to a short movie that people will hate for sure'. They should have had the courage of their convictions, and if they had The Avengers might have been a huge success. One can only hope they pull their fingers out and release the director's cut.

On reflection there's a lot to like in The Avengers: Uma Thurman in leather: always a plus, Sean Connery hamming it up more than Porky Pig at a bacon factory, and henchmen dressed as multi-coloured teddy bears. Bonkers. Utter bonkers. I like it."

3081,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"This film was a definite disappointment for a fan of the original series. However I didn't expect too much of an American remake of a classic 1960's British TV series- particularly one that made so much of its exaggerated Englishness.

Probably this was as close to the original as could be expected. After all even the New Avengers series of the early 1970's had lost the spirit of the original series.

The much-criticised Teddy bears scene was a classic Avengers gimmick - people who criticised this scene either never saw the original, or more seriously, didn't understand that The Avengers is understated English comedy. It was never meant to be taken seriously.

The special effects were in fact good, and did not detract from the film in any way. Perhaps people were expecting more fireballs and devastating explosions. There was little of that in the 1960's series.

One weakness was the dialogue. It was superficially similar to the original. But it didn't sound authentic when spoken by the leads. Fiennes was a fairly convincing Steed, and sounded reasonably authentic, but not so Thurman. There was no way an American could sound like Diana Rigg. I suppose they did as well as could be expected in the circumstances.

The moral has to be that it is a mistake to try to recreate a programme from another era and country. The result can never be very happy."
3082,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"I'm one of those people who usually manages to enjoy even really awful films in an ironic ""so bad it's good"" kind of way. But The Avengers is something else. It is so mind-numbingly terrible that I have only one word of advice for anyone thinking of watching it, especially if they were a big fan of the old TV series - DON'T!

Nothing about this movie makes sense - apparently due to bad test screenings a lot of scenes were cut, so perhaps this explains why the plot is so choppy and impossible to follow. In the scenes that survived and were cobbled together to make this diabolical mess of a film, the dialogue is awful, the actors look bored and bemused and the cinematography is dull. In other words, the whole thing falls flat on its face and fails to provide any entertainment or amusement whatsoever.

I really have no idea what Sean Connery, Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman were thinking when they agreed to appear in this film. I'm a big fan of Ralph Fiennes and he's been in some excellent films (The English Patient, Schindler's List, The End of the Affair) so why he wasted his time on this dire rubbish escapes me. His performance as John Steed is almost as bad as the movie, and there is absolutely zero chemistry between him and Thurman as Emma Peel, who is also totally useless in her role. Aside from the Bond movies, Connery's been in a few turkeys but I never thought I'd see him play such a badly written part in a film this awful.

I think I've got the point across by now - AVOID THIS MOVIE! If, however, you've read this and you're still going to give The Avengers a go, by the time it's finished I guarantee that your opinion of it will be the same as mine - this film is abominably bad!"
3083,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"Under normal circumstances, casting Uma Thurman, Ralph Fiennes or Sean Connery should indicate that a film is likely to be good.

Putting 2 of them together should be better.

Casting all three should pretty much guarantee a cracking film.

The Avengers, however, does not fit into ""normal circumstances"".

The main problem with The Avengers is that the three main characters are all horribly overplayed, in what end up to appear extremely hammed up performances.

This may have been the intention, but it just comes across as being badly acted- Fiennes' portrayal of Steed is just a little too ""stiff upper lip"" to buy into.

Aside from the main characters, there's also the rather worrying inclusion of Eddie Izzard to consider. He didn't really have that much to do, and I don't recall him having many (if any) any actual lines, but the small part he did play was just... well... odd. His characters is one of those henchmen types- the kind that just stands around, glaring. The problem with this is that his ""look at me, I'm an evil henchman"" stare came across as more of a ""look at me, I'm a moron"" stare. Granted, in this film, there probably isn't much of a difference between an evil henchman and a moron, but it still showed.

Still, the film does have a couple of (minor) saving graces- although I don't think it was a particularly good scene (even compared with the rest of the film), Sean Connery does look rather funny dressed as a giant teddy bear.

Also, as with Batman & Robin, Uma Thurman proved that she does indeed look rather fetching in a cat suit.

Over all, this film is only really worth watching if you happen to enjoy really bad films.

It is better to remember the various series than re-watch them, however. At first, I was excited when they were shown on TV recently. But I soon stopped watching them. They didn't age well.

When the movie came out, it didn't work on any level. It wasn't like the original series, so it didn't please those who expected it to be. It didn't have a good enough plot, and the actors seemed to have no idea who they were supposed to be playing.

Ralph Fiennes' performance was flat. Uma Thurman as Mrs Peel was the most spectacular piece of miscasting since Nastassja Kinski as Tess (of the D'Urbervilles)! Why not use British actresses for British roles?

One change I really didn't like. In the original series, there is no sexual relationship between Steed and Mrs Peel. Steed is a partner, a mentor, not a lover. In one of the final episodes, we even see Mr Peel, Emma's husband (he looks suspiciously like Patrick Macnee, of course). Steed is a gentleman, he would never presume on a married woman.

The relationship was very interesting, nonetheless. Making them lovers in the movie was a loss rather than a gain. All in all, a poor movie with few redeeming features."

I knew that they had avoided reviewer screenings, and understood the implications of that studio decision. I had seen the original series and while I liked it, I did not consider myself a huge fan. Unlike some I know, I had no problems seeing Uma Thurman as Emma Peel.

However, nobody I know who saw The Avengers was prepared for how BAD it was. Despite what looks on paper like an excellent cast of quality actors, they lacked almost any on screen chemistry and not even their combined talents could rescue this dismal film.

Instead of the witty banter the director strived for, what we end up with is endless prattle. Both Thurman and Fiennes appear to be just going through the motions. In fact, Fiennes' (who I consider an excellent actor) John Steed is so understated and stiff that he might as well have been replaced with a cardboard cut-out with a pair of moving lips. Sean Connery can't even save this turkey, seeming confused and bored on screen.

The only thing that might have saved the film was the cinematography. The Avengers is filled with eye candy and stirring images, but not even the camera work and set decoration in the film can save it. The opening theme was well done, but then disappears, leaving us with the rest of the score, which was simply disappointing.

Debates have raged between those of us who weren't lucky enough to avoid this film over what the worst aspect of it was. Some say script, some say direction. Yet others insist it was the actors. For myself, I can sum the film up with a quote from my wife:

""It was a movie I was sorry I didn't wait to see on cable - someone else's cable."""
3095,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"This movie was so wooden and fake. The two stars looked as though they were meeting for the first time and were awkward on screen together. Often they looked as though they were consulting queue cards for lines. I was left at the end of the movie saying 'You mean it is all over, already?' I found there to be no plot or substance to the movie. Uma Thurman has proven once again she can't act, and just looks good in tight clothes and short dresses, and has a bewildered look about "
3096,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),This film was boring. There was no character development and a plot that I did not care about. I wanted to leave the theater after the first fifteen minutes. The original TV series was far superior to this attempt.

3097,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"This film tries hard to generate the feeling of a London somewhere between the '60s and '90s but it fails since the result is a desolate city where people drive ancient cars. It looks more post-apocalypse.

Fans of the original series will be very disappointed, as there is no spark or magic when Steed and Mrs. Peel are verbally jousting. It feels like they are just showing off to the audience rather than having a conversation.

The result is stilted, rather than stylish and the subtle English humour that the main characters try to generate is too contrived.

This movie fails to capture or engage the audience. The character played by Eddie Izzard has more presence without saying a single word than the main act"

3099,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"If Sean Connery's in a movie, I'll see it. This one is so disappointing !

This film tries very hard to be spectacular. There's a preview on many home videos these days that features clips from classic old films, designed to inspire the viewer to go out and buy or rent movie classics - you know, Gone With the Wind and the like. I had the same impression, watching The Avengers. Mr. Freeze and his plan to chill the world, from Batman. The cat woman's costume and persona, draped on Uma Thurman. The catwalk fight scene from Moonraker. Search parties dispatched to locate James Bond, who turns up in a life raft with his romantic interest. A sprinkling of the hurricane special effects from Twister. There's even computer generated special effect attack bugs from an episode of TV's Gene Roddenberry's Earth: Final Conflict. To name but a few.

Does this producer have a single original thought in his head? You know, there are places in the world where people get fired for reproducing someone else's work without citing the source [like Boston!].

Ralph Fiennes, in The English Patient, made me feel his intense love and desire, and his subsequent anguish. The only anguish I felt watching the Avengers was over the total lack of character development. Both Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes were trapped into reciting lines that left them no opportunity to flesh out actual characters. That is not to say that a movie has to be serious for the audience to believe in the ""hero,"" James Bond films being a perfect example. The Avengers fell terribly short.

Perhaps Sean Connery got involved in this project, wanting to play the diabolical genius madman, bent on conquering the earth. What great fun that could be for an actor of his caliber. The same can be said for the motivations behind Thurman and Fiennes' roles as well-known heroes. Too bad the script was written so badly, the story so disjointed, to derail even the most devoted fans. The musical score was just as uninspiring.

And tell me, please, what's going on with the greasy guy in the wheelchair sucking down cigarettes? And the blind chick that is just too weird? What's the motto here? The bad guys are ugly, handicapped, and bizarre? I don't get it.

What was good about this movie? If you're into fashion, Thurman's wardrobe was stunning from start to finish. And sure, for the ladies, seeing Ralph Fiennes in the buff - okay, that was fun (though you didn't really need to do that, Ralph.)

This movie will definitely appeal to the average 15 year old, preoccupied with role models who have something ""cool"" to say, in any situation. If you're past the pimple stage in your life, however, these characters are as flat as the screen on which they're projected.

Overall, leave this film to rent when it comes out on video (maybe, next week) when you are looking for something mindless to do for 90 minutes."

3104,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"Whatever came upon me to sit through the very long 89 minutes of this film, I will never know. The only guess that I can come up with is to see Uma Thurman in those tight leather pants. This film is one of the worst of its kind that I have ever seen.

The plot was so incoherent that I did not know what was going on exactly until 45 minutes into the film. Sean Connery plays Sir August, who with the aid of a weather altering device, is trying to take over the world. So, the secret agent team of the Avengers are sent in to stop his plan of world domination.

Being a fan of Sean Connery's, it is a true pity that he would have taken such an awful role. I do give credit where credit is due however, as his demise is one of the most original that I have ever seen in film. I definately did not see that coming.

Maybe I am being a little harsh on this film, since I never saw the original television series that this film was based on, however, I would much rather spend my precious 89 minutes watching a quality James Bond film, than rip off material such as this.

Do not rent...do not even bother watching it on television, it is really not worth the time or money."

I only saw about 25 minutes of this movie and felt I was going to fall into a coma! The movie tries to be sexy (Emma Peel) and sophisticated but the dialog and acting are beyond atrocious. I did not even bother to stick around and wait for Sean Connery to show up! The mind-numbing banter of Finnes' character really grinds this movie into an unbearable desire to watch something (ANYTHING) else. Somehow, my brain cells reactivated themselves from this drek and helped me flick away with my tv remote.

3108,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"I went into this film hoping to have a great time, and I was sorely disappointed. The acting from the leads was good, for the most part, but they had terrible material. The writing was not the crisp dialogue I remembered from the series, and the plot was very predictable. By the end of the film, my three companions and I were about to fall asleep; not even the dramatic conclusion could keep us interested. The film did have some good points. It was good to hear Patrick MacNee again, and Ralph Fiennes made an acceptable Steed. Sean Connery made a good villain, although he overacted a bit. Overall, though, this is not a film I would recommend. My husband went so far as to compare it to Howard the Duck in its badness. He wanted to stand outside the theater and warn others, thus saving them from making his horrible mistake (cooler heads prevailed, however). We will settle with using this forum to warn you. Unless you need the sleep, do not go to see this film. If you must see Uma Thurman parade around in a variety of 1960's cat suits, wait for cable. Or video. Better just to skip"
3109,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"I am a big fan of Ralph Fiennes and have enjoyed most of the movies I have seen him in so I thought I'd rent this one to check it out even though I was forewarned it was bad.

Well, it was bad. REALLY REALLY bad. The movie is so laughable it is so silly, unoriginal, and there are numerous errors I spotted in the film. I have a feeling post production ruined much of the movie as I understand the original running time was almost 2.5 hours and it was edited down heavily to just 90 minutes.

It is unfortunte that such a talented cast-Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and Sean Connery was wasted on this mess. Ralph looked gorgeous,as usual though and he is the only reason I sat through 90 minutes of torture. A big Razzie for this one. 2"
3110,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"The key to the original Avengers television series was its bright dialogue, especially when this played on the flirtatious tension between Steed and Mrs. Peel. There is dialogue aplenty here, but it's never bright. There is wordplay in spades with a screenplay that is overwritten by half -- wait for the novelization. When delivered under the sluggish direction of Jeremiah Chechik, the banter is lifeless, as dead as a mechanical wasp from the film's most throwaway special effects sequence. Patrick MacNee provides a guest voice, and Ralph Fiennes does admirably well in MacNee's old role of Steed. The glamorous Dame Diana Rigg played Mrs. Peel the first time around. Here we have Uma Thurman. She has rarely been sexy or provocative in the past. She can't seem to find it here in her bone-dry, too clever repartee with Steed. Sean Connery chews the scenery -- there's a lot of it on the film's fabulous country estates. At least he looks natural in a kilt. The film revolves around natural disasters, but it managed to become one in the proc"
3111,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"What's the point of writing this review? Everyone ever born hates this movie, so there's no one to convince here. Why you ask? TO HAVE FUN WRITING IT!

On the good side: the actors really try their best. Connery is simi-funny. Uma is in leather, grrrrrr. And th cinematography is pretty good. Oh, and Big Ben is blown up.

On the bad: I think I can sum up the movie in a very simple, short idea. If an alien race, coming in peace, were to arrive on Earth millions of years after we blow ourselves up in some world war, they might find some movies and some equipment to play them. If the aliens are normal beings, with tastes similar to us, and they found The Avengers and watched it, they would think humans were crazy, stupid, and worthless creatures. And after being subjected to this mind numbing ""movie"", they would then seak out any remaining humans and probe them till their is nothing left to be probed. This is saying a lot because they are not a violent race and they came in peace.

In conclusion, The Avengers has some good parts. It looks rather pretty. And Uma Thurman is in a tight leather outfit. That's it folks. This movie tries to be artistic, and it comes off being insane. If anyone, ANYONE says this film is a work of art and is underrated, then seak out these people and probe them.

2/10 (it's that high due to Uma, otherwise, it would be a one)"
3112,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"This was a waste. A giant waste. Waste of time, waste of talent(yes, you read right, there were talented people involved with this film), and a BIG F---ING WASTE OF $60 MILLION BUCKS!!! Well, where do I start? Ralph Finnes is very talented, Uma Thurman(Uma was cloned in the movie, maybe in real life also, because this doesn't seem like the one in the awesome Pulp Fiction), cinematographer Roger Pratt(Batman, 12 Monkies), porduction designer Stuart Craig(Dangerous Liaisons), editor Mick Audsley(High Fidelity, The Grifters), costume designer Anthony Powell(all 3 Indiana Jones, The Ninth Gate), and most of all Jim Broadbent(Topsy Turvy) who was obviously smoking something when he accepted this role. Sean Connery is no villian!! The real villian here is producer Jerry Weintraub, who is the brilliant mind behind such breath-taking(not) films such as Soldier with Kurt Russell, Vegas Vacation with Chevy Chase, and The Specialist with Sylvester Stallone. His apprentices in this is a no one named Don MacPherson who wrote this trash, and director Jeremiah S. Chechik(Diabolique w/ Sharon Stone). This film is a mess.

3114,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"Many negative comments I have read on the film center on a comparison between the TV series of the '60's and this ... film. Taking this movie on its own (ahem) merits, one can see how weak and poor it really is.

Don't try to figure out motivation. Too much of the film ended up on the cutting room floor to leave coherent explanations for DeWynter's reasons for doing what he does. The clone of Emma Peel is a loose end we never really understand. (It's simply another contrivance, like so much of the plot of this movie.) And the chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman is difficult to believe.

Sadly, the cast is a very talented assortment displaying no talent to speak of. Fiennes and Connery deliver their lines with the strength of a TV movie. And while Uma Thurman makes an attempt at actually acting (with a passable British accent), her performance is underutilized by the laughable direction.

And I haven't even compared this to the original TV series. When that is made, you can see this piece of trash for what it really is.

Emma Peel is not a weak or easily intimidated character. The director of this movie thought otherwise. John Steed is not a flat, joyless robot. Apparently, Ralph Fiennes had to interpret Steed in this way as to make him less likeable. The sets did not emphasize the loopy eccentricities made famous in the series. Instead, the feel of the story is incongruous and annoying. And it's revolting if you loved the original series.

I was astonished to see this film being sold in stores for $8 (pre-viewed). Word of mouth made certain it was one to avoid. And to save your time and minimize your revulsion, don't even rent it. Watch the original series and rejoice in that original atmosphere and clever campiness."

3118,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"Astoundingly predictable, dull and IQ deficient, THE AVENGERS is really not worth the swag of a rental. The script is lame, and it also doesn't help that the two leads possess no chemistry whatsoever. Ralph Fiennes could have just as well telephoned in his performance, and Uma Thurman probably harangued her agent for getting her this gig. The special effects were ok, but it doesn't take Fellini to figure why this tanked at the box office.

Sean Connery portrays the atypical mad genius character, which has been around since the dawn of movies, itself. Sean takes the ball and runs with it, churning out one of the hammiest performances I've witnessed in quite some time. Absolutely merciless. Patrick Macnee has a rather lengthy cameo, as well.

When one takes into account the talent involved, THE AVENGERS should have captured at least a little bit of the magic that graced the 1960's series. Alas, it proved the old adage correct: ""You can't turn back the clock."""
3119,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"Why did they make this film? Why? The acting is okay, sometimes. Other times it sucks! The ""sexual"" tension between Thurman and Fiennes is the most pathetic display I have seen in a LONG time. The interaction between Fiennes and Connery, however, is good, but that is not enough to save it from being an almost total disaster.

Uma Thurman is, as always, beautiful but she is so much better than what she shows here. Fiennes showed that he is a very accomplished actor, e.g. in The English Patient, but he is dragged down by poor direction and a terrible plot. The same goes for Mr. Connery who is the one I pity the most. He is, normally, incredible. Here he is, at best, good. He deserves so much more than t"
3120,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"I viewed this movie about a year ago and must say that this was one of the worst ways that one could have spent $4.75 and 90 minutes of one's life.

It is hard to believe that such notable actors like Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and Sean Connery could ever be attracted to an atrocity of a film like this. As great as Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are as actors (in my opinion), they could not pull off their characters of Emma Peel and John Steed. They played them so cool, up to the point where they showed no emotion what so ever and everything was in monotone. But I must make it clear that I'm not blaming the actors, I am blaming the fact that these characters were terribly written.

The film itself, ugh, bleh, eck, and argh is about all I can mention. The film dragged on for an eternity. An hour and a fifteen minutes into the movie, the plot is finally revealed. Next, the movie tries to resolve everything in its remaining ten minutes. Then, everything about the movie was too confusing because none of it was explained adequately. The entire movie is too painfully boring to view.

The only thing I could say remotely good about this film is Sean Connery. He played his character, though his character is ill conceived as well, to the best of his ability and was able to pull it off. But then again, he pulled it off just barely.

Simply put, avoid this movie in any way possible. You'll be saving yourself from a painful experience."
3121,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"When the word gets out before the release of a movie or TV show that it's a real bomb, a snowball effect begins. Critics tend to jump on the (negative) bandwagon, the public gets an image stamped on its consciousness and the ""bomb"" label is like a self-fulfilling prophecy. This happened with the movie version of 'The Avengers.' It turns out the label is deserved, but maybe for different reasons than one might think.

'The Avengers' doesn't suffer from a stupid script or embarrassing bad acting. Whoever put this movie together bent over backward to make sure that every shot in the film and every line of dialog spoken was something that could have come from the British TV series of the '60's on which it is based. And much of it could get a seal of approval as far as authenticity goes. Except one gets the distinct feeling that love isn't behind this movie, but rather money. Things may look and sound like the old TV show, but this coldly calculated production totally fails to capture its spirit.

Even though John Steed and Emma Peel are supposed to be meeting for the first time as this picture begins, it is assumed that we viewers know the characters and everything about them already, so the action begins without any delay. Consequently, fifteen minutes into the movie, one feels like they've missed the first hour of the film. Also, one never gets involved in the convoluted plot and never develops any affinity for the characters. Plus, the film is given an obligatory 'Thunderball'-style ending done 1998 style. The old TV show never relied much on things blowing up and this addition here is no improvement.

In this context it's absolutely impossible for new actors to succeed in the roles of Steed and Mrs. Peel. Whether Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are doing a good job or not is not easy to tell and irrelevant anyway in this by-the-numbers production. They and Sean Connery (as villain Sir August de Wynter) are merely cyphers in this movie, and when could you ever have said that before about Connery, even if he does wear a bear suit? The one positive thing I can say is that Uma Thurman looks absolutely gorgeous as Mrs. Peel."

The villian, Sean Connery, runs an operation assisted by ONE henchmen (that's Eddie Izzard, by the way, who in any other respect is really cool. Check out Velvet Goldmine or some of his stand-up, trust me) and a bunch of guys in giant TEDDY BEAR OUTFITS (for the love of humanity what was up with THAT?)

The whole thing is poorly drawn out and just really surreal and I for one won't stand for it! BAN movie remakes of old TV shows!!

All things considered, though, I think the Avengers (who, incidently, weren't even really AVENGING anything) could have benefited from a little something known as WEAPONS. The filmmakers may have been trying to steer clear of that kind of violence, but you can't try to pawn off a movie as an action-adventure when the fight sequences use umbrellas and pointy-toed high heel boots, it just don't cut it!"

I hadn't realized it was a Jerry Weintraub (Diner, The Karate Kid, Oh, God!) film until the tape was rolling, and it re-assured me - it shouldn't have.

Jeremiah Chechik directs - or at least gets the so called credit for it. This is one of the worst directing jobs I've ever seen. Unlike some of the other reviews of this film, I think the base script wasn't all that bad - it wasn't all that great, but there was definitely something to work with. Nobody did. Fiennes and Thurman do the best they can, but, given that they both have exactly the same failings, I'm left to believe that they were actually directed to depict it that way.

The dialog is extremely fast and precise, as if they were directed to ennunciate every word crisply, but as quickly as they possibly could. It comes acrossed as being as natural as polyester. The effects and props are extremely contrived in their delivery (who came up with the bear suit idea??? - and I don't get the invisible man thing either).

I gave this a two just because I actually have seen worse. Still, to keep it to two words or less:

The film dives into the plot without ever giving the viewer any feel that there is a real threat, although because we have seen it all before we know what is going on. It feels like there are action sequences missing from the film at the beginning. Particularly ridiculous is the disguise of the conspirators in multi -colored teddy bear outfits and the introduction of an invisible man who does nothing to help drive the story.

3142,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"Surreal is really the best way to describe this movie. It beautifully encompasses the Surrealism movement that started in the 1920s and continued, in a way, to hint at Dadaism.

Even the dialogue in the film reminded me of going to an art museum.

""How real do you feel Mrs. Peel?"" There is a lot of hate behind this film, a 3.7 rating on IMDb and trolls complaining that Thor and Iron Man weren't in a movie based on a television series that had nothing to do with the comic books.

Ignore the hate, this is a movie that people walked into expecting a summer blockbuster and walked out disappointed because they got a thematic action movie art film.

It doesn't appeal to the masses, but made the mistake of thinking that it did. Because of that it was a flop.

But for those of us that don't cringe in horror over the thought of going to an art museum, the movie is beautiful and done in a way that most of the artist-directors out there can only dream of.

It looks brilliant, it looks like moving art on the screen and the dialogue fits perfectly into that mold. It is the surreal film that puts so many others to shame.

The only fault it has is the marketing. It was marketed for the Rambo crowd that want nothing more to see the blood and carnage, the over-the-top science fiction special effects that has aliens blow up the White House.

Instead you get Surrealist special effects and killer teddy bears. They hit the mark well, but only for those of you that real enjoy that sort of thing.

If you walk into The Avengers expecting a lowbrow action movie, you are going to walk out of it in the first few minutes. Think of it more as an action sci-fi art-house film and you'll love it."

3144,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"Regardless of the horrific overall rating of this film, it is a terrific one for many reasons. I think that the general American populace cannot appreciate a film that is so nuanced and delicate - a film that is a quasi-parody and yet delivers the thrills and romance.

Based on an old TV series, the Avengers stars the splendidly gorgeous Uma Thurman and the greatest James Bond that ever lived, Sean Connery. The male protagonist ""Raf"" Fiennes was less known, and doesn't suit the classic male-MACHO man that is bulky in muscles and filled with general animosity to other males and his antithesis (usually the 'EVIL' villain). He visits the elite club for men and pretends not to blush when his partner barges in. Both characters are highly stylized, elegant, and radical. It is possible to see that this is not a sensibility that Americans can understand or partake in.

This film is far removed from the normal spy-thriller. It chooses to take a very different tone, and purposely plays on gender-role reversal which is very refreshing to any true connoisseur of film or film study."

The scene where Fiennes checks his super-cool ""gadget watch"" that has directions for where he's going just confirms the sneaky suspicions I've been having that not every British spy movie is the next James Bond.

It was one giant set piece and special effect after another. Avengers is the most stupid, confusing, misguided, uninteresting, big budgeted, star studded, poorly made excuse for a film that I have ever seen in my life. And I mean that. This is the worst film I think I have ever seen. I have seen some really crappy movies like Jaws 4 and Never Been Kissed. But those are Oscar caliber films compared to this one. Simply put, the Avengers is a mess. I have no idea what the movie was trying to say and I could really care less. It is so inept that I actually walked out about ten minutes before the end. I'd had enough. I just couldn't stomach another minute of it.

Do yourself a favour and don't ever consider renting this. Or if you are suffering from insomnia, this will help, or if you are finding that you lack motivation at the gym and need something to help bring your anger out, this will do fine as well, or if you are short on toilet tissue.......

Let's just put it this way, I have never been in better shape in my life. When I workout now, I just think of how mad I was that I spent 10 bucks on this film and suddenly the weight feels much lighter.

look to Warner Bros. if you want to blame someone or something for there tainted hand ruined the story, Sean Connery is totally wrong for this, having saved the world so many times as 007 it just isn't believable for him to want to destroy it, its a real shame to think if this one got off the ground it may have been succeeded by a greater sequel, that could improve upon the chemistry, the story.

I would love to see what would happen if they released the original cut which 66% longer (around two and a half hours) to think of all the scenes and sense some of the plot would make (I still have no clue why there are two Emma Peels but I go with it)

3151,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"When I first saw the Avengers I thought it was a messy movie , not necessarily bad , but hard to follow and with very little to recommend , like a few good lines such as "" Isn 't there a Mrs Steed ? "" "" Yes there is.... my mother ! "" . Unfortunately the confusing plot made the film an endless stream of scattered scenes and streched the time slot from the mere 85 minutes to an experience which lasted more than 2 hours in the mind of the viewer . Everybody bashed this film and I believe they had their reasons. Everybody praised the TV show as ""brilliant"" , ""wonderful"" and ""tasteful"". When the public network decided to broadcast reruns I sat down with high expectations to see this long lost TV series ....... What the h**l was THAT ????? Most of the episodes were load of c**p (the Time Machine for example), literally unbearable to watch !!!!!!!!! Very few episodes were interesting , witty and campy in a good way , like the 10 Little Niggers rip off or the episode where Mrs Peel was kidnapped by insane film makers who wanted to make her the star of their movie before killing her . Other episodes were so - so , ""cute"" storylines like ""The Bird who knew too much "" , the ""Winged Avenger "" , the ""Invisible Man"" or the episode with the Nanny Academy . But as I said the majority of the show is nothing but a waste of money and film. Did anyone actually LIKE THIS ??? And I watched the so called ""best"" colourful episodes with Mrs Peel !!! As for the Patrick MacNee - Diana Rigg so called ""chemistry"" ??? Non - existing ! Mac Nee was as stiff as an ice cube and Rigg although has a kittenish charm it failed to reach any acceptor because Mac Nee had the erotism of Hercules Poirot ! Believe me even if you drilled deep deep deep down the MacNee - Rigg relationship it is more possible to find oil deposits than even the least trace of a remotely mild ""sub-erotic"" chemistry ! Not even the most unconfessed one , like Linda Hammilton with her colleaque (I thing he was called Joe) in ""Beauty and the Beast"" or even Jodie Foster with Anthony Hopkins in ""Silence of the Lambs"" !! On top of that there are the infamous carate kicks of Mrs Peel , which (you have to trust me) are ATROCIOUSLY bad . I don 't think there are words in the English language to express how HORRIBLE and unconvincingly directed these ""fight"" scenes were . This classic series is just a P.O.S. No wonder I had never heard of the Avengers before the movie came out !!! (in contrast with other campy 60's shows like Lost in Space or Batman who retained their reputation throughout time) . The filmic Avengers were a masterpiece compared to their ancestor !!

Nevertheless I decided to rewatch the film believing that the second time would be more entertaining . Boy was I right !!!! Now that I knew the plot 's surprises this wonderful satire was highly enjoyable . Everything fits in to place , everything makes more sense , we manage to learn the predicament and the motives of all the characters . Not only the pace is fast moving , not only the plot unfolds with a very composed way , not only the hilarious dialogue delivers A-list British phlegm to the screen ( "" Join me and we 'll rule the world "" ""You didn't say please !"" )but we manage to watch some of the most original and inventive surrealistic sets a film has ever brought us. Many have praised the Escher-esque eternal stairs where Mrs Peel is trapped but I will stick to : the greenhouse with a pleiad of plants or the musical kist of whistles along with a jewlery collection in Sir August 's manor .

The film 's negative points are : Emma Peel is turned more into a victim instead of a more active part and Stead is authorised to kill her if he suspects that she is the leak . On top of that the subplot with Emma 's dark side ( I won 't say more ) should be shortened because it got annoying . The good points : further than the impressive sets and some good SFX (like the snow blizzard) the casting was very successful . Sure Ralph Fiennes was a bit young for the shoes of John Stead but he had all the qualifications for the role . A charming English gentleman , cool tempered and mild mannered , but not deadpan or emotionless , and with the hidden energy of an inert volcano . Uma Thurman was a PERFECT choise for Emma Peel as she had the deadly beauty required . And YES the two leads have the much needed chemistry that their predecessors failed to reach . Oh , their acting skills ? Just as moderate as they SHOULD be . Remember they are British agents and this is a British inspired satire , not your typical adrenaline pumped American blockbuster with explosions and car chases (yes there is a car chase but very different from the usual ones : the pursuers are giant mechanical bees !!) . As for Sean Connery ? Although the script didn 't do Sir August DeWinters full justice , Connery makes a pleasantly memorable and decent job as the bad guy . Remember again : this is NOT your ordinary summer roallercoaster and if Connery stole the show the movie would have failed . The action scenes are wonderfully directed , since Stead kicks a** with his umbrella and Mrs Peel does a fine job with her carate kicks and when she sword fights with Stead .

Overall the Avengers is a much welcome witty satire of the American spy films like James Bond and action / destruction blockbusters generally (like Armageddon) . It is charismatic and eccentric in a very positive way . If only the producers hadn't chop it by editing out so many scenes we would have even more entertainment like the plastic transport bubbles or the deliciously quirky sets in the weather controlling headquarters with black and white colours and weird cross linked architecture . I hope we will have a director 's cut some day . Sit back relax and enjoy the Avengers . It is a great cinematic experience and if you find it lame just give it a second shot (much like the surrealistic Batman Returns) . It has top British phlegm and I believe the main theme and point of the film is summarised in a very characteristic line (I can't say in which point in order not to spoil it ) "" MANNERS , Mrs Peel !!"" =) Wonderful sets , costumes , cinematography , the familiar music theme and an intelligent script give a good mix . One special benefit is that (despite the use of computers and electronic gizmos) you can't easily designate the time period of the events since the atmosphere mixes various stylistic elements and is reminiscent of a fairy tale .

Soon to become a cult classic the Avengers is vastly underrated but it will grow in the public 's heart as time goes by . A definite

3157,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"I guess there are two ways of looking at 1998's 'The Avengers' film (and, yes, it has NOTHING to do with the Marval brand that would dominate the Box Office a decade later). You can either believe everything you've heard about it, or just keep an open mind and go with the flow.

It's a remake of a British 1960s spy show about a male and female secret agent, generally saving the world with gadgets and an assortment of witty quips. The studio had high hopes for the big budget adaptation and cast two major stars (Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman) in the lead. However, close to release it became clear (from 'critics,' anyway) that the movie wasn't that good and its release date got put forward while they did reshoots, or re-edits etc, trimming the run-time dramatically. When it did hit theatres, basically everyone hated it, claiming it was a 'mess' and it now lives on only in top ten lists of movies that bombed hard.

Yet, saying all that, I quite enjoyed it. I enjoyed it then and I enjoy watching it on DVD every so often. No, I'm not saying it's perfect (or even that good!), but I'm saying there's enough there to keep me entertained for an hour and a half.

For a start there's Sean Connery as the bad guy, who's threatening to control the world's weather and force countries to 'purchase' their weather directly from him. Therefore, Fiennes and Thurman must stop him. Yes, it's kind of like a Bond film plot and you can expect the regular punch-ups and car chases that come with the genre.

What you also get are some truly surreal scenes which don't make a lot of sense. Now, these could be written just to add to the film's 'kooky' feel, or it could be because the other scenes that explain them were left on the cutting room floor, therefore leaving these scenes' meaning up to our imagination.

People also remarked on 'how little chemistry' there was between Fiennes and Thurman. I can see their point. However, it's worth noting that they were supposed to be playing cold and unflappable characters lifted from yesteryear when this kind of acting/social interaction was more common. It's a case where the film tried to copy the source material and succeeded - only a little too well for its own good.

Like I say, 'The Avengers' is just about as far from perfect as you'll ever get, but it's not the car crash you've probably heard it is. And, if you're in the mood for a spy movie that's a little bit different and has a mute Eddie Izzard, a gun-totting Granny and a swarm of robot bees, then give this one a go. And I didn't even mentioned the giant teddy bear costumes."

3161,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"This is it: one of the most notorious critical failures in blockbuster history. This film promises a hip, new, action-packed rendition of the classic British spy show: a slick hybrid of explosive action, thrills, and quirky humor.

The film definitely tries its best to be quirky, to the point where nearly every scene is weird and off-the-wall. Such eccentricities include a council of villains who dress up as giant teddy bears. There are at least a couple of scenes where old ladies whip out throwing knives or machine guns. The heroes are chased by robot bees at one point. One of the characters has an evil clone, with no explanation as to how or why. There are oodles of other odd things going on here, but the film pushes its quirkiness over the top with its script, in which every single line is a pun. Seriously, nobody ever talks normally in this film: every line is a funny remark, and it can get old really fast. The spaces in between these odd parts are filled up with fighting, explosions, chases, fighting, explosions, fighting, and more fighting! My personal experience with this film has always been mixed; it's something I always wanted to like, but never could. The standard tropes of outlandish spy thrillers are there, and the action can be okay to watch at times. Unfortunately, the storytelling makes this a far duller experience, because there is no real story here to tell. With a whopping 28 minutes cut from the film in post-production, the plot is reduced to a constant string of action scenes, one after another, with zero character development, and zero reasoning given for why things happen on screen. In the end, it's hard to really latch onto this film beyond the aesthetics.

And the aesthetics get the job done. Photography isn't too bad. Editing is pretty stupid. Everybody in this film hams up their performances to match the quirky nature of the film. Ralph Fiennes bears a crud-eating grin the whole time, but still manages to channel enough charm and wit to make the most out of what he's given. Uma Thurman is pretty much reprising her role as Poison Ivy from B&R. Sean Connery doesn't seem to give a flying rip about anything, and in spite of that he seems to be the only one here taking his role seriously, even when he struts around in a kilt. I have no idea what Jim Broadbent and Eddie Izzard are doing here. Writing is horrible. This production uses okay-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects have not aged well. Joel McNealy's score is annoyingly repetitive and loud (which is a shame, because the movie's theme is not bad per se, and the CD soundtrack has been a favorite of mine since high school).

There may have been potential in this film somewhere, but so much of the story has been carved out in post-production that it leaves only a threadbare semblance of a plot, and a ton of frivolous action and ridiculous scenes. It's an interesting oddity at times, and a glorious guilty pleasure in its own right, but overall, it is the ultimate example of how a film with all style and no substance can fall flat on its face.

While MacNee looked urbane, amused but also amusing, Ralph Fiennes just looked twitchy and uncomfortable in this film, and can't seem to smile without looking like he is suffering from piles.

Apart from that, the film is reasonably OK. Sean Connery is below par but it is good to see Eddie Izzard here.

Of course the ""Englishness"" was as OTT a you'd expect of Hollywood. Why not make Steed and Peel a little more up to date but still quaintly British? Much like Bond, who manages to keep up with the times but still has those good old British tea-sipping qualitites!

The second aspect was the complete betrayal and lack of understanding of the relationship between Peel and Steed. They would have never kissed on screen any more that the lovers in a Bollywood film! Shock horror!!! :-O What jerk allowed that to happen. Obviously not anyone who's actually saw the TV series. I got my Chinese wife - who'd never seen the TV series before - to watch it after seeing the film. She got it! What's so difficult?

I heard an interview with Patrick Macnee (TV series John Steed) in which he claimed that kissing on the TV would have been scandalous. They only wanted to hint at the fact they slept together. That was another shock to me! It just goes to show that you can't even trust the actors to understand the full picture!

My interpretation has always been that their relationship was a platonic, professional one and that they never admitted they liked one another. Steed was always a bit old for her. I saw him more as a father figure to Peel. It shows how apparently wrong you can be! But I still stand by my interpretation as a valid one. Which is all the more why I was shocked when they kissed!

After that, the film turns into a Bond movie with gargantuan (thanks Kill Bill) special effects that seem out of place when compared to those in the low-budget TV series! The final scenes just underlined how far this was from any concept I had of the TV series.

I was upset that I had wasted my time and money on watching my notion of the Avengers being crucified at the altar of money grabbing, insensitive and ultimately cowardly Studio Executives and Producers, and a spiritless director and actors who hadn't the nerve to quit the production when they saw what a travesty they were creating.

In the end the film satisfied nobody. That's what can happen when you sell out in a big way. So the film bombed and that's the only satisfaction I can get from having seen it.

Let British film be made by Britons in Britain please. There's less chance we'll misunderstand and sell out. They may even get an injection of new ideas into those Hollywood stereotypes."
3167,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"...and sometimes, you feel like watching a good-bad movie. ""The Avengers"" falls firmly into that category.

I have no particular love for the original show; it's witty and fun, but ultimately quite shallow. ""Doctor Who"" and ""Sapphire & Steel"" could eat it for breakfast. But I can still understand why ""Avengers"" fans and purists hate this movie. Certainly, Fiennes and Thurman have zero chemistry. The original stars - Patrick McNee and Diana Rigg - were much better. However, the film's shallow plot is actually quite faithful to the shallow original! ""The Avengers"" TV show relied on surreal imagery and eccentricity, and the movie has these qualities in spades. It's no masterpiece, but it's certainly not a total clunker.

Highlights include the teddy bear costumes (this, too, seems in keeping with the TV series), a scenery-chewing performance by Connery, and some very impressive sets and costumes (I found Uma's outrageous outfits quite attractive). Shame it's all so staid and wooden, but you can't have everything.

Apparently, about 1/3 of the movie was hacked out, so the plot is hard to follow and there's a definite disjointed feeling to the proceedings. And why is poor Jim Broadbent made up to look like some corpulent vampire? Oh, there's problems aplenty here, make no mistake. But I was in a generous mood when I watched it, and I found myself thoroughly entertained despite myself.

The DVD is commonly available for about $6, probably because no one in his or her right mind would want to buy it. But I'm frequently not in my right mind, and I have just about $7 in my pocket now. Should I buy ""The Avengers"" or shouldn't I? Hmmm..."

But that isn´t the actors or director faults.The responsible for the failure of the movie is Warner Brothers Studios, because they decided to cut some parts of the film, thus creating the movie that some call the worst movie ever made. I think people who say that, haven´t seen such craps as Mission Impossible 2 or any of Chuck Norris films. I liked The Avengers because it´s a different type of action film. It is placed in a very surreal world where anything that is important, isn´t taken seriously, and anything that is crap is taken as world threatening problem. The acting is great, especially Uma Thurman, who in this movie already shows some of her fighting abilities which we have seen in these years: Kill Bill.

To say that there are major plot points left hanging would imply that there actually was a plot, and that would be rather too generous. And as attempt to modernize the 60's series the result is an utter failure, dripping with freakish non-sequiters and tripping over its own oh-so-hip irony.

3171,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"Firstly I feel I ought to say that this film isn't quite as bad as some people make out. Don't get me wrong, relative to the series this film is an outrage not so much failing to capture the magic of the original as dancing on its grave. What could have been a whole series of campy-surreal Avengers flicks produces instead only this choppy mess. There are some fun moments - none involving Sean Connery - the sets look fabulous, the soundtrack is excellent and it's always lovely to see Fiona Shaw and Eileen Atkins whatever they are doing. That this movie is such an appalling mish-mash with only a very few scenes indicating the original intention to make a decent movie is I believe entirely down to the terrifyingly bad judgement shown by the film's director Jeremiah Chechik, perhaps (indeed for his sake hopefully) under duress from Warner Bros.

The selection of Chechik himself to handle such a big project given his relatively undistinguished career seems eccentric, perhaps it was felt that as a Canadian he might have an inside track on a series whose distinctive British quality might have made the suits uneasy. However like Lee Tamahori he shows very little understanding of the way the series actually works and his directing of Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman is hamfisted enough to ruin the film on its own. Steed, supposed to be witty, urbane, charming and warm is reduced to a man who emotes less than the furniture in his chic London pad. Mrs. Peel is simply a mess - with no real explanation given for her behaviour in the script Uma Thurman's performance lurches to different extremes from scene to scene like a drunk playing hopscotch.

The real villain here, however, is Sean Connery. Not, I'm afraid to say in the film, in which he delivers one the worst performances of his already one-note career but in the effect that his casting had on the script. In early drafts the character of Sir August Merryweather (as he is called) was a harmless old buffer, the real villain being someone else entirely and the plot hingeing on the death of Mrs Peel's husband thus giving her some sort of motivation and explaining why at the start of the film she is no longer running the Prospero Weather Programme.

The studio executives, salivating at the fact that Connery was interested in the script ripped it to shreds to find a role to accommodate him. When the film was screened before test audiences they reacted badly to its eccentricity, the lousy direction of the two leads, the fact that Connery was terrible and the new plot involving him incoherent. The studio's solution was another celluloid massacre performing big cuts making the already messy film a total disaster.

What I find most disappointing in this movie is that there are just enough moments in it to realise that what you are actually watching is the corpse of a good film and that a splendid opportunity to revive a bit of British telly history has been comprehensively ruined. The cut footage may have made things better but really, aside from a good early draft of a script, there is nothing here for anyone involved to be proud of. What a shame. Sixty million dollars of shame in fact."

Other than that I would have skipped this one, and wish I did. For the most part it is a rather dull movie with a few interesting scenes here and there. Not totally awful, just not very good. Connery doesn't put much effort into his role, but then none of the cast is all that good...though you do get to see Uma in a rather nice costume.

Whether on video, dvd or at the cinema, you have my deepest sympathies.

I have a rule that if I pays my money, I WILL stay to the end of the show, but this film really, really tested me.

I found no redeeming qualities in this terrible movie, and I tried. Uma Thurman in various catsuits is outweighed by Sean Connery in a teddy bear suit. Some nice sets (if a little overdone) are far outweighed by Ralph Fiennes, who acts like he learned his trade in commercials for soap powder. Laughable action sequences and dialogue written by, I believe, an infinite number of monkeys at an infinite number of typewriters just round it off nicely.

Didn't anything make me smile I hear you ask.

One thing.

The end credits."
3176,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"Take three of the biggest names in Hollywood, combine them with strong characters, great special effects, a huge budget and one of the biggest selling television series of all time and what do you get? Sadly, all you end up with is weak dialogue, poor direction and a lack of any real plot.

The plot is a particular problem with this film. While the original used devices such as doubles, weird devices, mad scientists and so on, it never did it *seriously*. This film takes itself too seriously and, in what appears to be the director suddenly realising this, he sticks the band of villains into teddy bear suits. Oh dear.

Sean Connery, surely one of most acclaimed of late twentieth century actors, is wasted in this ridiculous farce of a film. Most of the time he seems to have been told to imitate Windsor Davies in the British sit-com ""It Ain't Half Hot Mum"". In several scenes I was convinced it actually *was* Mr Davies, until a close-up dispelled the illusion. Maybe they could have saved money by hiring Davies instead of Connery, and getting the script rewritten again.

The director, it must be said, tried in places to pay homage to the original series - obvious references to such episodes as ""The House that Jack Built"", ""Small Game for Big Hunters"", ""The Town of No Return"", ""The See-Through Man"" and ""The Forget-Me-Knot"" and, I suppose, a couple Tara King episodes, may have vaguely entertained die-hard fans, but not this one. To have viewed so many episodes of the series and then still not *get* it smacks of gross ineptitude.

At no time did he get a real grasp on the characters - Fiennes characterisation of Steed was insipid, more in keeping with Roger Moore's smarmy, two-dimensional Bond than Macnee's superlative Steed. Blatant sexual innuendo was never part of the Avengers ethos, there we had greater subtlety.

Uma's Mrs Peel? First of all, while she is still a scientist, she's not the same kind. Physics, not chemistry is her forte, yet she seems oddly distant from a project she was supposed to be the driving force of. While she does display the occasional swash-buckling excellence, her characterisation is not strong enough, only the device of an evil clone of Mrs Peel allows Thurman to act as the original Mrs Peel did.

Connery's villain I have already discussed. the less said the better.

The redeeming feature? Macnee's 'shining' cameo appearance.

Not, perhaps, as bad a film as I had been lead to expect, certainly no worse than ""Starship Troopers"", but nowhere near the excellence of the original production. Bring back television."
3177,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"I went to see this film with an open mind. After all, it did have a few good actors to its name. By the time I left, I understood why this film had not been shown to the press before general release. The lines were corny, the plot was as well thought out and structured as a sneeze and the humour was pitiful. Quite simply, this was the worst film I had the misfortune to see all year. OK, so it must have some good points. The actors they picked were good but none of them made any effort. (quite sensibly) Uma Thurman's costumes were nice but quite honestly, didn't suit her role as an action heroine. In fact, the only two parts I was impressed with was the inspired bit with the teddy bears and Eddie Izzard's Mini Cooper. I think that's it. Don't see this film basically, no matter how impressive any of the trailers or stills l"
3178,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"""The Avengers"" is NOT a bad film by any stretch. The opening credits are stunning, Ralph Fiennes is great as John Steed and Uma Thurman shocks with an actually believeable performance (unlike Poison Ivy in ""Batman and Robin"") as Mrs. Peel.

What brings the film down overall are some rather silly action sequences (the killer bees, for one), the convoluted ""cloning"" sub-plot and a lack of chemistry between the two leads. Also, I'm still wondering what they are ""avenging"" exactly, because the true nature of the ""weather tyrant"" (Sir August) does not really come through until the last quarter or so, and I found it hard to keep up. Perhaps this is a problem with a dialogue or unnecessary sequences (I'm not sure about those dress-up bears).

Sean Connery is a highlight, as is the sassy Sixties spy/thriller music. Also, in the middle of a crisis it's good to know that one can stop for tea (in several instances this was hilariously great). The visuals and direction is good, playing like a giant TV episode. Overall, ""The Avengers"" is an entertaining flick, but only if you don't think about it. 6 out of 10."
3179,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"You know, when I was in college and not all there, I used to think out loud, ""Dude... would it not be rad if the magical ponies took on star wars?"" I never really expected anything to come of it, I mean the magical ponies vs. star wars is much too deep a concept than the american public could ever withstand, I mean that's almost as good as if the carebears took on james bond! I mean that could never happen.... right?

Wrong. Enter The Avengers. This movie sold me immediately because I'm a sucker for Uma Thurman, though it did bother me a bit to think that throughout the movie she was preggo with some other man's child. How could she do this to me? I thought we had something special. ""Shut up Tal, and get to the mashed potatos."" Okay, okay, don't yell. Going to this movie, I didn't know what to expect, I've seen the classic TV show, and first of all it's not such a classic. I haven't seen it anywhere in like forever. The truth is that is basically was supposed to be like another James Bond type thing.

The movie begins with Ralph Finnes (playing John Steed) and Uma Thurman (playing Emma Peel) being called on some top secret confidential code red really hush hush type meeting with this nicotine stained version of... of... well, some old fat guy in a wheelchair. So there's this chick impersonating Uma and killing people and doing all kinds of mean things, so, who do they suspect? hm. Uma.

In preparation, Uma dons her tights and prepares for battle. You never see her naked in the movie which is a negative quality about any movie whatever (I am a firm believer that any movie could be made better with a nude Uma Thurman, even grumpy old men could have used a bit of ThurmanBreast). John Steed is almost naked in this one scene, this should excite you ladies. Not. He's such a dork, whatever, not worth the time.

So Sean Connery is this scotsman Sir August de Wynter who wants to control the weather, and decides the best way to go about it would be to dress up as a carebear (I kid you not). So then all the bears run around shooting each other, Sean gets ****ed, calls up a mighty storm, the avengers step in, Uma kills her clone (I almost cried. Who in their right mind would kill a perfectly good Uma?), there's this great action seqeucne where Sean and Ralph fight for a bit. Ralph kindof wins (he is a sissy afterall), Sean loses and we learn that metereology should be left in the safe (albeit plump) hands of Al Roker.

If my commentary made no sense, neither will the movie, but it makes no sense consistantly, and makes no attempt to convince you that it is making sense and you're just missing it, kindof like when the carebears had a moral which didn't make any sense at the end of their show, like ""never paint your neighbors lawn green because it already is"" and then they'd cackle on insanely with glee as if they've just revealed one of the secrets of life, and we used to laugh along with them. Now, if you're like me and have waited for the bad bears to come out and play, this is your flick. Either way, it's a good way to pass the time and is a perfect makeout movie for you datebuffs because if you miss any chunk of the movie, it'll be just as if you missed nothing at all."

The concept of the story by itself was cool, the wardrobe, art direction, set decoration, special effects and music departments were very good. But I don´t know what happened then, i don´t know if it was the screenwriter who did such a terrible script, or the editors who just didn't know what they were doing. I still don´t know what was the Mrs. Peel clone intended to be, or why the villain was so obsessed with her. In the actoral aspect, all the cast was ok, except for... the three main charachters. I don´t know what happened here either because Fiennes, Thurman and Connery are very good actors. Steed and Mrs. Peel look more flat than the screen, and they have no chemistry between them.

One of the most entertaining TV series ever made, Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, Sean Connery, Eddie Izzard all starring and a production crew who actually seemed to have watched the series and wanted to do something similar (not like Mission Impossible then...). So, what went wrong? Well, when the running time of a film goes from 120 minutes to 90 minutes, it's not hard to guess. Added to that, Warner Brothers went further in showing that they did not rate the film by not having a critics showing. Come on guys, why not just have posters saying ""It's a dog - don't watch it!""? Having said all of this, I enjoyed the 90 minutes of the film I was allowed to see. Ralph Fiennes was excellent, opting to take the role seriously rather than send it up, while Sean Connery showed that he'd make a damned good Bond villain. The fights and stunts were well arranged, and the set design truly startling - especially the snowbound Trafalgar Square. Against all this, Uma Thurman seemed to be paying more attention to her accent than to anything else.

What I didn't suspect what that the editor (I heard it was actually edited by Bozo, you know, from 'Bedtime for Bozo', Ronald Reagan's greatest flick) decided that with the best bits, also half the story would have been cut. 'What WAS the deal with the two Emma Peels?' was just one of the questions left at the end, just like 'Did I just pay to see this?' I did. Damn.

Worst of all was to see Ralph Fiennes (who's undoubtedly a VERY good actor) look like a banking clerk who walked onto the wrong set and just decided to 'have a go' at playing Steed. I kept thinking, 'Hey bowler hat, where're you going with that little guy?' Isn't Steed supposed to be old & fat instead of good-looking and skinny? And isn't Emma supposed to be British, or am I just nit-picking now? Whatever. I won't even mention Sean Connery's performance here.

'Saving the World in Style' was what the film was advertised with over here (and perhaps every else - I don't know) and I think this is what the biggest problem was: getting as much '60s stereotypes/clichés in there as possible, without thinking about the story. At all. Too much emphasis on 'style' has resulted in no style at all.

Golden Turkey acting credit has to go to Sean Connery, however. Mind you, when your character has no character, what is an actor to do?

I have never seen the TV series, giving me no basis for comparison, so I must say the this movie was not too bad at all. I'll admit that the acting fails for the first little while but the acting isn't where you're attention is drawn. Once the movie picks up Ralph Fiennes is again in a commendable role for him (John Steed) while turning up his class and charm to pull off the character better than I could have imagined. Uma is Uma... although talented and made the character work, not a good casting job. And finally, Sean Connery plays a villain almost as classy and likeable as John Steed. The only thing left to knock is the editing that, while awkward, could have been alot worse and most likely kept the story from dragging on too far.

The supporting villains were rubbish: useless English micro-celebrities with no style or acting ability. The mighty ""Avengers"" theme was hardly used.

3196,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"The one thing that makes this a turkey is the total miscasting of Ralph Fiennes. I think they made a fair stab at recreating the outright weirdness (especially in the clipped dialogue) of the 'golden age' original series, but none of it comes off because of Ralph. He's too young for a start. The whole Steed/Peel dynamic was the sexual tension between an older man and a 60's type emancipated woman - the unspoken suggestion that however emancipated Mrs. Peel was, Steed still had the answer to all her problems(! - and yes, she could come to his rescue too). The script acknowledges this, but Ralph Fiennes comes over as a sexually repressed nerd who's just come from spending five grand in Savile Row, not an old-fashioned 'man of the world', like Patrick Macnee's Steed. Diana Rigg and Macnee managed to make some absolute tripe amusing and watchable, because the relationship between them as characters was sexually charged - there was so much unspoken. If Uma Thurman had had somebody to strike sparks off, the humour in the script might have worked, and people would have seen it for the outrageous sendup it was attempting to be: but Ralph plays it even straighter than Schindler's List, and the relationship between Steed and Peel is just a badly-scripted double-act. As it is, the funniest thing about Ralph is the size of his hat - yes, Stan Laurel in Ollie's bowler comes to mind. (I don't think Sean Connery was all that bad - at least he hammed it up consistently...and there were points where it was far better than 'Batman Returns', weren't there?)"
3197,The Avengers (1998),3.8,Jeremiah S. Chechik (as Jeremiah Chechik),"This one's a shame. I came into it as a fan of Uma Thurman, Ralph Fiennes, Sean Connery and the original television series ... and I like strange movies. I had the most flattering pre-viewing perspective going on, I swear. But I barely made it through that opening scene. It was too odd. I stuck it out (and I'm glad of that), but I can see how zillions others would not.

I think the comments about the how badly the movie was casted was due to the opening scene wherein Ralph Fiennes as John Steed goes through his strange little agent evaluation. It was too much of a shock to this poor woman's system to see Fiennes doing the Jackie Chan thang. I don't think Fiennes can only play elegant, subdued characters (in Strange Days he didn't look so bizarre punching and being punched), but this whole scene was just lame at the gate. I can just see how an opening scene with even a little more subtlety (there could hardly have been less) would've paid-off handsomely.

I was quickly engaged by Steed's and Peel's flirty dialog full of double entendre's and remembered why as a grade school girl, it was the only show that my father and I happily watched together. It also reminded me of those wacky English comedies from the 60's like What's New Pussycat ... just didn't remind me enough though. It was too middle of the road. Just not the right amount of outlandishness. When it WAS tossed-in, I found myself thinking, ""What the h*ll is that?"" (especially in the case of those Grateful Dead style teddy bears)

I did love the sets and gadgets and Thurman's groovy clothes. Ralph Fiennes was very sexy as the reserved John Steed (Hello! that boot scene!). Uma Thurman also was really neat as the brainy sexpot (I love that look on her face when Connery makes that crack about being wet.) I think Fiennes' and Thurman's chemistry was successfully evident. Sean Connery, however, looked pretty much annoyed.

There just wasn't enough good stuff in the space of 90 minutes to outshine the bad stuff. It's too bad."

3200,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,Warning: Spoilers
3201,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I've rated several hundred movies on IMDB, and overall, I go easy on them. Most of the so-so ones get a 5 or 6. A movie has to be pretty bad to get a 4 or 3 from me. And movies with a 2 are simply, awful, awful movies.

I have saved the rating of 1 exclusively for Batman and Robin, for I'm pretty sure no movie could possibly suck more.

Normally, when I walk into a theatre with low expectations for some movie, this gives the movie an advantage since I've basically lowered the bar for it. I held low expectations for Jurassic Park, but ended up being surprisingly entertained.

Batman and Robin failed completely to meet even the rock-bottom expectations I held for it when I saw it.

The script is a complete wreck. The jokes are an insult to your intelligence. The acting isn't especially bad, but then again, very little is required of the actors. The action sequences are confusing and incoherent.

If you're a Batman fan, then you will hate what Joel Shoemaker did in this film. His bastardization of Bane pretty much kills any possibility of a Knightfall-based movie. If you're not a big Batman fan, you'll just hate this movie just because it's so freakin' stupid.

Any pros? Well, I've read some reviews that say the sets are beautifully constructed. Personally, I thought the sets were ok, but hardly anything special. Nothing that couldn't by done with lots of construction paper and elmer's glue.

So, no, there aren't really any pros."
3202,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Don't get me wrong, the old Adam West Batman TV show was certainly funny, and given the times, a more accurate representation of what Batman was trying to be wouldn't have succeeded nearly as well. But the show still betrayed all the emotion and grimness of Batman's themes.

In Batman & Robin, Schumacher seems to be getting back to those roots. He treats the entire Batman franchise like a joke. Even if it was funny, this would be betraying the name of Batman. But here, seeing as it's NOT funny, it only succeeds in becoming the worst of the Batman movies, and, arguably, the worst films ever created. And I'm taking into account Plan 9 From Outer Space, Gigli, and You Got Served.

George Clooney just plays George Clooney. Which is the road he usually takes, but this suave, dashing, and charming Batman seems more like Mystery Men's Captain Amazing than the crimefighter of legend.

There's Chris O'Donnell, the angst-ridden Robin trying to break out of Batman's shadow. The only thing he ever really does is act like a child.

Alicia Silverstone. Wow. I seriously wonder what makes someone say, ""Hmm, who should we get to play Batgirl . . . I know! Alicia Silverstone!"" No offense to Alicia, but she's out in right field on this one. Her tough-girl performance is sprinkled with reminders of her Clueless days. But all that aside, she actually does very little.

Now, onto the villains. Uma Thurman, who we know CAN act, is hamming it up to ridiculous proportions. First, when she's playing the nerdy Dr. Pamela, she exaggerates that to a level I thought impossible. And then she inexplicably turns into an extremely sexualized villainess whose plan, by the way, would kill all the plants she advocated protecting.

Arnold seems like the worst possible choice for Mr. Freeze. I mean, of all the Batman villains I could see him playing - Bane, for christ's sake - Mr. Freeze is not on that list. He possesses none of the emotionless, calculated, and cold (no pun intended) sociopathy which makes Mr. Freeze such a good character.

And then, all that aside, they're handed ridiculous catch phrases and cliches they're expected to say with any level of sincerity? At one point Mr. Freeze says ""chill out."" Of all the ways it sounds, menacing is not among them.

Seriously, I'd have more respect for Schumacher if I discovered that he hated Batman, and had intentionally ruined it with this garbage. Then, this might actually be just his own personal joke. Instead, it borders on a travesty of good cinema. I only wish that 0 stars was a selectable option at the imdb, for this film ALONE."
3203,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Batman & Robin, the big summer movie of 1997, I remember seeing this in the theater when I was 12 and even then I wasn't impressed. But when I was more grown up, I watched this film again, I figured since I loved the 3 previous Batman films, why not give this one another shot? Now, seeing this movie once again, I can understand the low rating on IMDb, this movie was just a pathetic attempt at merchandising Batman and making an over the top action movie that really had nothing to do with Batman. The casting was just oh, so plain wrong. We have Arnold Schwartzenegger as Dr. Freeze?! Not to mention the accent, the character was just someone you felt like you could laugh off. Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl, she was alright, but again, questionable casting since she seemed out of place. Now, George Clooney?! I couldn't believe how Val Kilmer got complained about, but George Clooney I can see why. He was just the most awkward Batman ever and didn't fit the role at all, he was only used for his popularity.

Batman is living it up with his bachelor lifestyle, but Robin is a bit upset that he is living under Batman's shadow and wishes to be the star. Alfred is becoming very sick and needs serious help; his niece, Barbara comes to his aid and hopes to help him and stays with Bruce Wayne. Dr. Freeze is our new villain and is looking for a cure for his wife who is frozen until he can find a cure for her, he also is intending for the world to pay for what has happened to him and his wife for some reason. Dr. Pamela Isley is a plant scientist/right activist and while her boss sees her finding out more than she needs to know about an experiment on his version of Frankenstien, named Bang, he ""kills"" her with her plants. But the plants chemicals have an effect on her and actually make her into Poisen Ivy. She and Freeze team up to take over Gothem and of course to split Batman and Robin forever, oh yeah, then kill them I guess.

Batman & Robin was really beyond over the top, the costumes were a bit silly and the story was just too family friendly. This is Batman, the Dark Knight, it's not meant to be this bright and so crazy. I couldn't believe Joel did this, I really wish I could get past this, I know he's going to get a bad rap for this film for the rest of his career. The acting was just stupid and not true to Batman at all. The problem here was that the story and setting just had nothing to do with what Batman truly is and was just an excuse to spend stupid money. Please, don't watch this film if you love Batman, or you'll be sorry.

3204,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"BATMAN & ROBIN will make you lose all faith in Hollywood, indeed humanity as a whole. Stunningly awful, this was a disaster from the moment George Clooney traded in his scrubs for the black rubber boots. And it's not even awful in a cute, SHOWGIRLS kind of way. You won't laugh, but you might cry over the fact you've just flushed 125 precious minutes of your life down the crapper.

While everyone involved brings shame to their families, from the uncomfortable Clooney as the lamely-interpreted hero to Governornator Arnold Schwarzenegger as the junior-high-dialog-spewing Mr. Freeze, director Joel Schumacher must be punched the hardest. Even those who thought he embarrassed the franchise with the light-hearted BATMAN FOREVER were taken aback. Schumacher treats the audience like a group of eight-year-old boys with ADD, constantly trying to impress us with unexciting action scenes like a hockey-themed opening battle reminiscent of the under-appreciated genius of MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS.

The writers only make things worse with their ""witty"" hero chatter (""This is why Superman works alone""... har har, where do they come up with them??) and drawn-out ""human"" angles, such as butler Alfred's illness and a childish romantic triangle between Batman, Robin and the sexy Poison Ivy. This isn't root-on-the-heroes entertainment. On the contrary, you'll find yourself wishing Poison Ivy would tongue kiss both masked men to put us all out of our misery.

I love Batman and superhero flicks. I'm not a movie snob by any means, as I'm willing to forgive many a gaffe. But I absolutely loathe BATMAN & ROBIN. I loathe how it disgraces the characters it depicts. I loathe how the ""talent"" involved is still allowed within 100 feet of a film set or writer's room. It must be said again that BATMAN & ROBIN is the kind of experience that will make you lose all faith in Hollywood -- and humanity."
3205,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"This is the most disappointing movie in the history of film for me.

A 2 out of 10 is generous. I should give it a zero strictly based on the Bat Credit Card scene.

Every single individual whether it be producers, director, writer or actors (minus Chris O'Donnell) should be ""Bat-Whipped"" for this piece of junk. This is your typical ""absolutely cannot fail"" franchise in film getting raped by studio execs making critical content decisions about a film when they have no talent to do so. Batman is popular simply because of the comic book not because of that retarded TV show starring Adam West, but this movie is more fashioned after that campy trash. This was nothing but a slap in the face to every true fan of the Batman. The direction of Joel Schumacher was deplorable. The set designs looked cheap (the ice looked and acted like dried craft glue) and were visually painful, especially the overuse of the red neon hue in many scenes. The digital effects were OK but often over done. The production cost was extensive, and I wonder what percentage of the budget went to the salaries of Arnold, George, Uma and Alicia. I'm sure it was high. I know Arnold got $20 million, so the percentage had to be fairly high. Well, everyone one of them needed to give back large portions of their salaries because their performances were atrocious. Alicia Silverstone needs to give her entire salary back. Hers was probably one the worst performances ever in a major motion picture. Arnold can't act anyway so I wasn't really expecting much, but I was disappointed when I heard he was cast as Freeze because he in no way fits that character. Freeze was a scientist and when I look at Arnold my first thought is not ""Scientist"". Ben Kingsly or Patrick Stewart would have fit better. Uma, who is normally a credible actress, was too ""drama queen"" which made it hard to immerse yourself in scenes she was in. Clooney was totally miscast as Bruce Wayne/Batman. I mean it's hard not to laugh when Batman is shorter than Robin. George like Uma was too overly dramatic, especially in scenes with Alfred, which made it hard to take him seriously. Chris O'Donnell was really the only actor that seemed real. With all that, I would have to say the overwhelmingly worst part of this movie was the script. Akiva Goldsman should have been banned from Hollywood after this script. It was a completely brainless jumbled mess. The story, which was pitiful at best, gets completely lost in entirely too many characters. It was so frustrating seeing the origins of certain characters ripped too shreds as Goldsman attempted to jam them into the script. Batgirl, who should have never been in this film in the first place, was changed from Commissioner Gordon's daughter to Alfred's niece, which made absolutely no sense. In an attempt, to explain why Freeze was so muscular it was explained he was an Olympic gymnast. How freakin' stupid is that? Gymnasts by necessity need to be small in stature to perform well in gymnastics and Arnold is enormous. Goldsman's use of dialogue was highly irritating consisting of nothing but one juvenile one-liner after another after another after another. One other thing that really irritated me was the complete mishandling and waste of the character Bane. Bane is a much more complex and vicious villain in the comics, and this movie version with Bane reduces him to a mindless henchman. Bane deserves much more character development than he received in B&R. The same thing happened in Forever, when one of the most highly complex and interesting villains in the comics, Two-Face, got reduced to second billing. Note to Warner Bros. stop screwing with Batman he can sell himself, and stop trying to cram so many characters into the films, and understand nobody wants to see a Campy Caped Crusader."
3206,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Strangely enough, that's one ice-related pun that Mr.Freeze doesn't use in this film. Though it does adequately describe the movie. What was I thinking, watching Batman & Robin for a third time? Even worse, what was I doing actually starting to enjoy it?

Yes, there's something endearingly awful about a film that fails on almost every technical level. But it wasn't always so. The first two films in the franchise, anchored by the strong, and much undervalued lead of Michael Keaton, were enjoyable pop-art excursions by Tim Burton. The first, still by far the best, allowed Jack Nicholson to ham it up amongst retro stylings and the music of Prince. The second, Batman Returns, was a less successful effort to homage German expressionist cinema, the darkest of the four films, and struggled slightly under the weight of three villains.

The lesson wasn't learnt, and the usage of multiple baddies has been a fixed staple ever since. With the third, Batman Forever, the flat acting of new bat Val Kilmer was coupled with Joel Schumacher's garish direction and Chris O'Donnell's irritating Robin. Akiva Goldsman was now the writer, and any sense of depth had given way to trite puns and disjointed set pieces.

And so it was that everything that was symptomatically flawed with the series was expanded upon and magnified for the fourth, and by far the weakest, instalment. George Clooney has accepted a lot of the blame for this film, a humble admission but unfair. While he's clearly miscast as both Batman and Bruce Wayne, he doesn't give a bad performance per se. Rather, it's his back up that lets the side down. Uma Thurman (am I the only one who doesn't think she's that good-looking?) has a great time overdoing it as Poison Ivy, but she's joined by Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze. Schwarz, not exactly known for his acting skill, is unrecognisable under his costume, so what's the point? He gets to call Batman ""Batunbuuurg"", refers to Robin as ""Buuurd Bouy"" and only has 100 lines in total. The fact that 26% of these lines are lame puns on the word ""ice"" that even a two-year-old would struggle to find funny is even more deplorable. And when you hear Freeze tell Batman ""Yew arr not zending mee too da cooola"" the urge to use the video's ""stop"" button is almost insurmountable.

Bane makes up the trio, a monosyllabic muscleman in a gimp mask. A completely unnecessary addition, he offers nothing to the plot and goes largely forgotten. The introduction of wonky-mouthed Alicia Silverstone as a fatuous Batgirl character is also grating. And why doesn't her costume come fitted with Batnipples like the rest?

Tiny traces of amusement can be gleaned from Ivy's dialogue, with her urges that her ""garden needs tending"" adding some form of adult tone to the humour. However, it's unrelenting innuendo - ""I'll help you grab your rocks"" - does start to wear thin very quickly. I did smile at Batman's cashcard: ""I never leave the cave without it""; and it's also nice to see some small references from other films. Even if it is just a glimpse of the Riddler's costume from Forever, some guards paraphrasing Cobra or some street bystanders dressed as Clockwork Orange Droogs. In fact, the idea of a Batman film as completely OTT comedy send-up may have worked, were the rest of the humour more sophisticated. ""It's the hockey team from Hell""; ""So this is where you hang out""; ""I'll cancel the pizza""; oh, how lame and functional the dialogue is!

The film wraps up with a rather pathetic plot contrivance, and George having to dish out bland platitudes. ""Not all heroes wear masks""; ""to give life... that's true power"". Oh, it really is abominably bad. Batman & Robin exists as a classic example of the Hollywood system folding in under its own weight. However, the universal slating this one got neglects one factor: while the least successful, it still made over $230,000,000 at the box office. I wonder how many people would be satisfied with ""failures"" like that?"
3207,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"This is hands down the worst film ever made in the history of the existence of the universe. There have been some bad films made but this is a travesty. It is hard to believe that money was spent to make this. It could have been used on something else (charity I suppose). I was 12 when I went to see this and it broke my heart. Batman was my favorite comic book and character when I was a kid and this film broke my spirit. The excellence of the Tim Burton/Michael Keaton films are long gone. The dark emotional center and development of the hero and the villains is sidelined for action sequences, action sequences and some more action sequences, some of them incorporating the worst CGI and model work ever seen on film.

The casting itself had to the potential to make a good film. George Clooney could have made a great Batman (square jawed, popular with the ladies), the only thing going against him being that can be too laid back (maybe with a better script he could do the darker material). Uma Thurman is perfect for Poison Ivy. She is a good looking yet quirky actress, but you wouldn't know it by the emphasis on camp context and innuendo in this film. Arnie is maybe a little miscast as Mr Freeze, but he does well getting a chance to use some 'great' puns, but someone who can come across as more evil would have been better. Then there is Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone as Robin and Batgirl. Let's just say more charisma can come from a line of fridge freezers with nothing in them. The only decent performance comes from Michael Gough as Alfred, only one of two actors to have appeared in all four films. His performance is wonderful in this otherwise mess of a film.

The blame for this disaster can be laid at the hands of Joel Schumacher. His direction misplaced and his intentions misguided. He may have redeemed himself with Phone Booth, but he will always be the man who destroyed Batman in my eyes."
3208,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I know that there has to be some justice in this life, so everyone will pay for their sins and crimes someday. I shudder when I think what will happen to Joel Schumacher for killing the ""Batman"" franchise.

""Batman"", the best of the series, was a dark, psychotic and complex movie with over the top acting and settings. The Batmobile was beautiful, as were the sets. The movie was forceful and interesting. ""Batman Returns"" shared some of the traits of its predecessor while adding more lunacy to the mix. It did suffer from the lack of top of the line talent (Jack Nicholson).

And then Mr. Schumacher ruined everything.

""Batman Forever"" is a shame of a movie, but NOTHING compared to what this piece of garbage is. Since its from the same series, there is no excuse for the director to run wild and away from the spirit of the originals, in which a sad soul has to fight crime in order to mantain sanity. In Schumacher movies, Batman has to have the coolest cars, to kiss the most beautiful girls and to have a lot of fun while doing this. The first 2 movies acknowledged that killing or hurting people was a conscious choice which was painfully taken by Batman; in the last 2 it is as if violence was fun and part of Batman´s life.

There are so many wrong things about this film it is useless to count them. But there are two things that are an insult to every film goer: the Batmobile is reduced to a clownmobile, and Batman´s suit has NIPPLES in it. What a disgrace of a movie. This doesn't even qualify as ""so bad it is good"". This is merely ""so bad it is bad""."
3209,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,Warning: Spoiler
3210,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"1. Cast Arnold Schwarzenegger as a scientist and have him spout nothing but one-liners for the entire movie. I cannot stress how bad his performance is. Even by his standards the level of acting is shockingly poor. Also Mr. Freeze was an intelligent guy in the comics then it doesn't do to cast a guy who can't even speak American without a heavy accent. Despite Schwarzenegger's intellect (he is one of the governors in USA with the highest IQ) he comes off as an ignorant person because of his accent.

2. Allow George Clooney to play Batman as gay. I am actually a fan of Clooney but his performance in this movie is disgraceful to say the least. He has stated himself that he found it amusing to play Bruce Wayne as gay. I, a great fan of the comics, did not find this amusing at all.

3. Move away from the serious tone of the first movies (which made them successful) and do a poor imitation of the 60's camp show with Adam West.

4. Cast Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. I usually think Uma Thurman is hot but her overacting in this movie is so distasteful she loses all kind of sexual appeal, which in turn destroys any kind of menace the character should have had. Poor, poor, poor.

5. Allowing Joel Schumacher free reins over the movie after seeing which direction he was taking the franchise with the previous movie. This is just the sign of a bad producer.

6. Remove all tension in the fight sequences by dumbing them down to the point where it is beyond stupidity. Batman and Robin playing hockey with a diamond is not my idea of a cool fight scene. Several fight scenes actually had me gasping with shock as to how poor they are.

7. Cast Alicia Silverstone as a bad girl (Batgirl). She cannot pull it off.

8. The nipples people. THE NIPPLES!!! How ridiculous is this?! Batman and Robin's suits have nipples but when Batgirl makes her entrance notice the lack of the same.

9. Write a script that makes no sense whatsoever.

10. Turn one of the most memorable villains of the comics into a brainless henchman. I am referring of course to Bane who in the comics is one of Batman's worst enemies because of his strength and intellect. Bane has actually beaten Batman on several occasions and although The Joker is undoubtedly Batman's nemesis Bane isn't far off. I squirm with the way they treated him in this movie.

In my honest opinion this could in fact be the worst movie... no scratch that... worst thing man has ever created. So with that I give my final score.

3211,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I can't help it, but I would take ""funny"" over ""dark"" every day and twice on Sundays. I recently purchased ""The Dark Knight"" on DVD, but in some way I regret it, and I am pretty sure that I will watch ""Batman & Robin"" again before giving 2008's Batman a re-run. That dark stuff just doesn't cut it for me, I don't care how many people rated ""The Dark Knight"" 8.9 out of 10. ""B&R"" is entertaining if you don't take the movie (or maybe yourself) too seriously. And that's what I remember about reading DC comics in the sixties: it was fun. ""The Governor"" as Mr Freeze alone is worth the price of the DVD (probably now around five dollars), because he takes the term ""camp"" to levels nobody dared to think of, which is fine by me since he's just a comic book villain.

3214,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"When I see reviews for the movie 'Batman and Robin', people always seem to say that it is an awful movie and one of the worst films ever made. I have seen it, and to be honest, I really like it. It is campy and a little stupid, but it really doesn't deserve to be given the same title given to other horrible movies like 'The Garbage Pail Kids Movie' or 'Jaws: The Revenge'.

I'm not saying that people should stop hating on this movie (because I can see what people have against it) but I do think that people need to calm down about it. There are far worse superhero movies out there like 'Superman IV' and 'Catwoman'.

Onto the film itself, like I said, I can see what people have against it: ""The acting is awful, the story is campy and the movie overall isn't well directed"".

I don't think the acting is that bad. There are a few characters who are terrible (like Batgirl, who was meant to be British but it is obvious that the actress is American), but some characters do pretty good performances. George Clooney does a good job as Batman, Michael Gough does a great job as Alfred, Uma Thurman is a convincing Poison Ivy and Arnold Schwarzenegger is a pretty funny Mr Freeze (although I do agree that most of his ice puns are painful). The rest of the characters are pretty mediocre, but not terrible.

The story is no Oscar-winning masterpiece, but it is still a good story that flows well.

The (very) basic plot synopsis is that Batman and Robin are trying to stop Mr Freeze and Poison Ivy from freezing Gotham City and taking over the world. (Of course!)

That may sound like a boring and clichéd story, but it is actually quite good. The sub-plots fit into the story perfectly, especially one about Alfred dying of MacGregor's Syndrome.

Overall, I feel that Batman and Robin is one of the most over-hated movies of all time and should really be given a chance. Like I said, it isn't perfect, but it really isn't as awful as everybody says. If you watch the movie with the knowledge that is a campy flick, you'll have a good time, just don't listen to the people who say that it is a horrible abomination to cinema, because it really isn't.

I appreciate it more and more every time I see it. Not only does Joel Shumacher bring the Batman franchise into a whole new light, but he chose a dynamite cast. It's funny, family-friendly, and has some wicked action sequences. I can't see why anyone would dislike ""Batman and Robin"", because 'holy nipple-suits, Batman! This movie rocks!' If you haven't seen it yet, rent it- or better yet, buy it! The story is awesome and the acting is incredible. The costumes, music, and lighting are exceptional. You can't get much better than Batman and Robin. It's almost as good as Batman Foreve"
3218,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Honestly, I don't understand why people rambled on about this movie being garbage. I actually really enjoyed it. Although the previous one is still the best of the four.

The only low point i could find was that the plot jumps quickly from one point to another without any explanation. Otherwise, everything else was great. George Clooney played a different kind of Bruce Wayne/Batman..a more lighthearted, smiling guy. Honestly, I found he was good...then again George Clooney could just stand there and he'd make me swoon. Chris O'Donnell was also great in his reprise as Robin, and I enjoyed him a lot. I loved the brotherly dynamic between the two characters that was shown in this film.

Alicia Sylverstone was also good as batgirl, although if she wasn't there, it wouldn't have made a difference. But she was, so basing my review off of that, she did her role well.

The two villains were very entertaining. I loved Uma Thurman's poison ivy, and I found her to be highly entertaining. Her powder became annoying after a little bit, though. Also, Arnold's Freeze was very good. Yes, he had some corny lines, and yes he was a little creepy looking, but overall he was very convincing as a villain and actually provided a challenge for the protagonists (unlike the other bad guys we've seen). His backstory, about trying to find the cure for his ailing wife, was very emotional as well.

Overall, as I've said for the past movies, do NOT listen to the critiques and base your interest off of that. Rather, check it out for yourself and give your OWN opinion on it. You might be surprised and find yourself enjoying it!"
3219,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Not that great, either. Most of the bad things you've heard about this movie are true, but that doesn't stop the film from being entertaining.

Seeing Batman and Arnold Schwarzenegger duke it out is reason enough to see ""Batman & Robin."" But while Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze carries impressive weapons and strikes a menacing figure, his lines are cheesy instead of threatening. In fact, cheesier lines haven't been heard since Adam West played Batman.

George Clooney makes a likable super hero. Unfortunately, he's not really Batman. Batman is tormented by inner demons. George Clooney never stops smiling. Even though Adam West's lines as Batman were unbelievable, he still said them with a straight face, as if they were serious. George Clooney says even serious lines with a cheesy grin. He's believable as rich playboy Bruce Wayne, but, even though his attempt to get Batman to lighten up was a noble idea, the character should be played with some darkness.

Still, there's a great warmness between Clooney and Michael Gough, who plays Alfred the butler, and between Clooney and Chris O'Donnel, who plays Robin the Boy Wonder. Bruce Wayne's personal life is in turmoil. Alfred, his friend and mentor, is dying, and Bruce must cope with the idea that he might lose him. Robin is tired of standing in Batman's shadow and begins to jeopardize the Dynamic Duo's partnership. Both subplots are well acted and touching.

The plot is completely preposterous, but that's to be expected from a movie based on comic books. It's still entertaining. The gadgets are impressive, the action scenes are well done, and the Batmobile, as always, is cool. The lead actresses, Elle MacPherson, Alicia Silverstone, and Uma Thurman, are talented and very easy on the eyes. Uma Thurman, as the evil Poison Ivy, possesses a magic powder that will make men do anything for her. This seems redundant to me, since her sexy costumes alone are enough to make men do anything for her.

If I had to choose a worst out of the Batman movies, I'd pick this one. Still, it's light entertainment, and worth a look."
3220,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Critics can't take a joke, obviously. This is campy good fun in the tradition of the old Adam West TV series. Okay, so Clooney was a stiff Batman - he was SUPPOSED to be. Chris O'Donnell was cute as a button as Robin -- ""Rubber Lips"" is my favorite line of the entire movie. Thurman practically steals the film as Poison Ivy until Alicia Siverstone trumps her as the all-feminist Batgirl. A few gags don;t work but so many of them do -- I cannot believe the flak this funny, camp outing got from so many people. If you want a movie to complain about see Nicole Kidman singlehandedly ruin the Peacemaker or see Eyes Wide Shut -- a horrible valedictory for Kubrick, but Batman and Robin -- one of the worst movies of all time !!!???!! That statement makes me laugh -- but not as much as all the good chuckles I got from the film"
3221,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"People need to understand what Joel Schumacher did with this movie, intentionally or not... made an extremely funny film. I'm not comparing this to Shawshank or A Clockwork Orange, but none the less this is an incredible piece of film.

This may be one of Schwarzenegger's most dynamic roles(excluding Kindergarten Cop). You can see some emotion in his character, instead of the normal robotic monster killing tank he always is, and the puns were incredible...INCREDIBLE. Schwarzenegger single handedly made this one of the best bad movies I have seen in ages.

Uma was great as Ivy, I often found myself wondering how Robin could resist her for so long. Her accent may have been a little over the top, but it matched the movie and made it even better. However I feel that they could have put a little more work into her sidekick Bane, who I feel was put in the movie just to use a beauty and the beast reference.

The writing was decent, I burst out laughing every time a character blurted out another ridiculous pun. Quotes such as ""Ice to meet you,"" ""Adam and Evil,"" and ""Let's kick some ice!"" made me laugh well after the credits rolled.

When batman uses his grappling hook to climb the building I almost thought they gave him the ability to fly, and at that point in the movie I wouldn't have put it past Schumacher to do so. I think the only thing that could have made this movie any more absurd and entertaining would be to cast Robin Williams as Alfred and give him a ten minute monologue.

There were a few problems though. This was by no means Clooney's finest hour, and although she fit the movie perfectly, Uma Thurman has definitely acted better. As I said, this movie is NOT, I repeat NOT a thinker. If you are looking for a movie in which you can delve into the deepest recesses of your mind go watch Requiem for a Dream, but if you want a solid movie where you can sit back and relax, Batman and Robin is for you."
3222,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"How did the Batman series begin so well and come to this? OK, none of the films are masterpieces, but this one is insulting. Anyone who paid to see it should join a class action to recover damages against the filmmakers.

Lousy acting from great actors. And some of the worst -- perhaps the worst -- set design ever. The plot is a grab bag, literally. A little of this, a little of that. No particular rationale behind any of it. I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall as the cast watched the film. Every single one must have thought, ""It can't get any worse than this.""

The most amazing thing of all: Director Joel Schumacher has actually been entrusted with directing jobs after this."
3223,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"The Batman series was started by a reimagination by Tim Burton. He took his dark style and adapted it to a tortured comic book hero. The results were pretty good. Batman was a fun flick to watch. Batman Returns was too dark, and so when a motion was put forth to lighten up the next film, Tim Burton walked away. Enter Joel Schumacher. Now, not that Joel Schumacher is evil, but he is kinda. His idea to turn Batman into a big-starred parody somehow managed to go by with little scrutiny with Batman Forever. Probably because there was so much hype. And now Batman and Robin. No need for a good actor, George Clooney says he'll do it. The result is a relative disaster, making all believability and style Batman had go out the window. Joel Schumacher just didn't care about the characters, dialogue, integrity, watchability, anything other than dollar signs.."
3224,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I hope Tim Burton takes over the Batman movie series. If WB didn't learn their lesson after this one, they never will. Batman Forever I liked, but it foreshadowing this movie, which turned the once cool, dark, Batman-worthy Burton version into a glow-in-the-dark, kiddy-show, campy version. I still say this movie is OK, but if something isn't done about Joel, I won't be saying this for much longer.

Here we go...

Batman: I am so surprised that everyone says that George Clooney is the best part of this movie. He is the worst Batman in my opinion.(I think Kilmer was the best) Clooney isn't that bad, but I didn't think he fit. And the Batman Credit Card? I wanted to puke in my popcorn when I saw that!

Robin: Robin reminds me a lot of Luke Skywalker, minus the coolness. Chris O'Donnell plays the part well. Unfortunately, the part is a whiny, annoying, untrustworthy, gullible, stupid sidekick. Don't bother defending Robin, he isn't worth it. He was OK in Batman Forever, but his character isn't improving.

Batgirl: You know, we really didn't need another sidekick right away, did we? Why Batgirl now? Save her for number 6, for crying out loud! Alicia Silverstone is great (though not in this movie) but that doesn't hide the fact that the character shouldn't be there. And the constant battle of the sexes between her and Robin are annoying.

Mr. Freeze: Ugh. The only thing that saved this character was the fact that it was Arnold, and that didn't save it. I won't forgive Joel for putting a great guy like Arnold into a crappy role like this. Yeah, his thing was ice, but that doesn't mean EVERY LINE OVER 5 SENTENCE (no exaggeration) had to be an ice pun!

Poison Ivy: The thing that really saved this movie. Uma Thurman did a great acting job for this part, despite some other opinions. She was very sexy and interesting, unlike Mr. Freeze. In some parts, you were waiting to get back to her scenes. This was the only interesting villain in the movie.

Bane: I am stunned at Joel's ability to take a cool villain from the comics like Bane and turn him into a drooling, stupid, grunt-like idiot. I am too disgusted to talk about it.

Alfred: Alfred is just as good as always in this movie, although it is getting annoying how he wants everyone he knows to be one of Batmans sidekicks.

Commishoner Gordan: You know, in Batman you had respect for this guy. Now his only scenes are when he drools over Poison Ivy. Sad.

Overall, Uma Thurman's sexy role in this movie alone is enough for you to watch this movie. To die by getting kissed by Uma, what a great way to die! :)"
3225,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I saw this movie upon it's release in 1997 I was just six years old and honestly I loved it so much I even had a Batman & Robin movie poster in my room that I got for attending the movies opening day. I got the movie on VHS for my birthday after it was released and I watched it pretty much every weekend at least twice but now that the movie is over twenty years old and I'm an adult with much better taste in movies I thought I'd watch the movie again on Blu Ray and give a review on my nostalgic experience and see if my opinion on the movie has changed much over the years.

The first thing I will say about Batman & Robin is that it's the worst Batman movie of them all hands down no amount of nostalgia or good memories of the movie will change that it is simply awful but having said that it's still a fun movie to watch simply because of how over the top and cheesy the movie is from the over the top acting down to the absolutely terrible Batman jokes like the Bat Credit card and the hilarious Mr Freeze one liners told by Arnold Schwarzenegger himself it is impossible not to laugh when watching this movie it's not the serious Batman movie we wanted and it doesn't do the Batman character justice at all.

This movie alone was the reason we didn't get a Batman movie for eight years because Batman & Robin failed completely and almost killed the franchise luckily in 2005 we got Batman Begins which introduced the true Dark Knight and would lead to the greatest Batman movie ever made in 2008 Batman The Dark Knight.

I love the cast involved Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze is hilarious and Uma Thurman as the sexy, seductive Poison Ivy she really makes a deadly character like Poison Ivy a lot of fun and she really does make the character look sexy as hell.

This movie is absolutely hilarious and is a guilty pleasure for me I don't watch it because it's a good movie I watch it simply because it's entertaining and enjoyable it's essentially Batman the parody it's not to be taken seriously it's a bunch of famous actors dressing in spandex so tight we actually get crotch and butt close ups so if you've always wanted to see a Bat suit with actual nipples and a cod peice then your in luck. This isn't the best Batman movie but try and enjoy it for what it is an hour and a half of entertaining fun."

Batman in this movie at his best, I thought the costume design made him look exemplary and i thought the nipples were bad-ass. I would watch this movie over and over for its great plot, seriously great cast and great cinematography. I would highly recommend it to any Batman fan such as myself for it is the greatest batman movie of all tim"
3228,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Lots of people and Batman fans have plenty of good reasons to hate this movie and be completely disappointed. Sure, Joel Shumacher treated the entire franchise as a big joke, made the characters over-the-top and filled this movie with cheesy and corny lines. Sure, he murdered the depth of certain characters and made a lot of weird additions. So what? If you're here to simply get entertained, then Batman and Robin has the perfect formula in place. This movie is extremely funny and there's some nice action too. The characters aren't serious but they sure are lovable. Sure, it may be a comedy or even a parody at heart but its a highly polished comedy no doub"
3229,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"This film was not as good as the first three films. It could've been better, but it was not all that bad. Joel Shumacher returns as director for the fourth sequel of the Batman series. There are some surprising actors in this film. George Clooney takes on the role of Batman while Arnold Schwarznegger takes the role of Batman's nemesis, Dr. Freeze. Freeze wants to ice the city up and he gets some help along the way in the form of Poison Ivy(Uma Thurman). The acting was not terrible, but in some ways it could've been better. The score was not as strong as the first couple films. The script was alright, but the plot line was the best about the film. I also like the costumes that were used in the film. They were very unique. Die-hard fans of Batman will be disappointed at this movie. But, I liked it a little. I rate this movie a 7/1"

3232,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"It is hard to describe life. Stories about mermaids fighting wars in different galaxies, that is easy to describe; but writing about life, sometimes all you can say is, ""It's about life."" Batman and Robin is a story about a place, a place most people might not be able to conceive: where things are dying, where people survive off liquor and cigarettes, where those who are supposed to love us drive knives into our backs. Clooney is good when he is bad and good when he is good, so no point in dwelling on him. It's worth watching this movie just to see him. This film has a feel; you can sense it and I was getting a little shaky halfway throug"
3233,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"The dialogue is so cheesy and the acting so hammy, the only thing left to do is slap it between two slices of bread with a bit of mustard. With one of those little olives on the toothpick stuck on top.

The silly over the top action and fight sequences combined with rather colourful sets make the movie feel more like a Saturday morning cartoon than a movie.

But you know what? It's not that bad. Not saying it's good, but it's certainly not as bad as people make it out to be. ""Batman & Robin"" is a fun movie.

While I do like Christopher Nolan's serious take on the Batman, I'm not always going to be in the mood for that Batman. Every now and again, I'll want a Batman movie that doesn't take itself so seriously. That's where ""Batman & Robin"", as well as the rest of the 90s Batman film series, will come in."
3234,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Most people, especially fans of the earlier Batman films, hated this movie. I did not. In fact, although it's not my favorite in the series (my vote goes to Batman Returns), I still found this refreshing in its cartoon-ish innocence. After all, it is based on a cartoon, so what is so unforgivable about making it light-hearted just once. Does everything have to be dark and brooding? I hope not. Well, unfortunately, people like the darkness more than the light. Just look at the reviews here, for an example of that.

I just went along for the ride on this, enjoying the outlandish characters and corny-but-humorous lines delivered by Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze and Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. Both were a lot of fun to watch. Batman, meanwhile, has been played by some many actors I don't care anymore who has the role.....its' nothing to get serious about, anyway.

Whoever seems to play him does a decent job. This Batman version seems a lot more softer character, higher-principled and compassionate....sort of the real-life wacko (George Clooney) who views himself as such as a knight in shining armor for the typical Hollywood Left Wing crowd. But....we'll forgive him, for he not knows what he says.

I appreciated the added humor in this film, the fact there almost no profanity, unlike the other versions; the wild special effects, ogling Uma Thurman, who looked fantastic; great color and surround sound; interesting sets and a nice message at the end.

The negatives were: a little too much action which can make you dizzy trying to follow; a somewhat-annoying Robin (Chris O'Donnell); Alicia Silverstone's role as Batgirl adding nothing to the film; and a little too many sexual innuendos to counteract the absence of profanity, I suppose.

Overall, a fun movie not to be taken seriously: simply a cartoon come to life, which is what some people think it should have been in the first place."
3235,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I'm a Michael Keaton fan, so in my view, no one else can be Batman but him. I've never actually met anyone who's picked George Clooney as their favorite, so if you watch this one, it'll most likely be for the supporting cast. The adorable Chris O'Donnell plays Robin, the equally adorable Alicia Silverstone plays Batgirl, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a frosty yet comical villain, and Uma Thurman plays a wicked seductress. See what I mean? You'll probably forget George Clooney is even in it.

Unfortunately, this installment wasn't even as successful as its predecessor Batman Forever, which wasn't very good. The consistently good feature shared by both films is the kid-friendly attitude. These are comic book movies, and should be able to be enjoyed by kids of all ages-aren't young folks the target audiences for comic books? The later volumes are far too dark and frightening. The darkest part of the movie is an uninteresting sideplot about Batman's butler Alfred's health-but it can still turn into a funny scene if you make fun of George Clooney's smirk and head tilt instead of paying attention to what he's saying. So, if you're looking for a good one to start your youngster on, this is it."
3236,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"This is such an underrated movie! Of course this movie is meant for the teen age group (unlike The Dark Knight) and it does have a lot of action and even a little humour, which isn't common in Batman films. Add to that great actors like George Clooney and Arnie the Terminator along with Chris Odonell and the gorgeous Alicia Silverstone and you have an awesome Batman movie, which is, compared to all the other Batman films, the most ""fun"" one. This is also a very original film, complete with a new storyline and lets not forget all the special effects that light up the film. The musical score for this film is also something to mention and should be released as an album. What is different about this film is the fact that even though it is a serious-storyline film, it isn't meant for a ""The Dark Knight"" type audience, the reason being that it is kind of a mix of a superhero film and a cartoon.

3239,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Some come here and say how can this movie get so many negative reviews? I myself wonder how this movie could be in the 100 worst ever. It was actually a very good movie.

The answer to your questions is simple. The comic book geeks feel cheated - they don't feel this movie followed the comic book as close as it should.

See the comic book geeks feel they have to bombard this movie with negative reviews because they want the next Batman movie to follow the comic book. I myself could care less and just want a good super hero movie. I personally thought this was the best of the Batman movies. It wasn't so darn dark - resembles the Batman tv series of the 60's and Superfriends than the comic book.

If you are a comic book geek skip this movie. If you like Adam's West Batman or Super Friends Batman (a batman that aint so dark) I really think you will like it. I did.......so there comic book geeks take that BAAM ZOWIE KABOOM!"

I can see being bitter about the loss of Tim Burton and Michael Keaton but come on. If you are one of the people who rated this thing a 1 out of 10 then you are required to : 1) run from room immediately or 2) through an object at your TV should it ever come on the small screen.

If you don't do one of the above then your vote was wasted. What does a 1 for this film mean about Gigli, White Chicks, Showgirls, Blair Witch 2, Battlefield Earth,The Avengers,The Sweetest Thing, Ballistic Ecks vs Sever, Grease 2, Shanghai Surprise, Ishtar, Wild Wild West, The Haunting, Idle Hands, Cabin Fever, or the remake of Rollerball? Voting a 1 here doesn't mean anything when there are a bunch of other movies out there that are so awful you want to punch out the person that sold you the ticket.

So back off next time when you have a go at this movie, just because you don't like it doesn't mean you have to put it down. I am a fan, and I know there are heaps of us out there.

3242,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I really quite enjoyed this movie. Its completely over-the-top bravado impressed me. Be warned though, if you take Batman seriously then you shouldn't watch. But for the majority of us, the non-anally retentive people, then this movie is a lot of fun and well worth a rental.

The villains were very cool in this one, and we had FOUR!! Arnie got better as the film went on. He was a real hoot. Uma was totally over-the-top and crazy as Poison Ivy. She was funny and extremely hot! There was also Bane as Ivy's sidekick who was funny whenever he appeared even though (and probably because) nothing he said ever made any sense! Then there was Bane's creator, Dr Woodrue played by John Glover with probably the best performance of the film. I wish he could have been in more of it.

The heroes weren't so flash though. Alicia Silverstone was spunky as Batgirl but the title characters, Batman and Robin as played by Clooney and O'Donnell were pretty lame. Batman was made to say too many corny one-liners. This should have been left to the villains, it suits them. It definitely didn't suit Batman. Robin was just flat out annoying. Michael Gough as Alfred actually gives quite a good dramatic performance in amongst all the campiness, I'm not sure why he bothered.

The SFX were great. The weren't at all realistic which was the way it was intended to be you fools! The whole film is dazzling on the eyes, whether it be the sets or the aray of good looking actors and actresses. Too put together a film of this large of a scale is quite an achievement. Anyone who says that Schumacher isn't a good director, doesn't know anything about directing films.

This is definitely one of the best no-brainer films of recent years. To all you people who are pining for the miserable Burton Batmans, get stuffed. Burton made his two movies, if you like them so much, then go and watch THEM. Schumacher has now made his two films to appeal to a different audience. Now it's probably time to see what someone else will do with the franschise. I can't wait.

8/10 - Terrific fun."
3243,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"The Nolan trilogy , although loved by many, has a problem that bore me: takes itself too seriously. Guys, let's face it: Batman is a guy who dresses in bat clothes and walks around with a high- tech car through the alleys to fighting crime. Now imagine a guy doing it in real life. It would certainly be as funny and ridiculous as George Cloney or Adam West walking the streets. Schumacher's Batman & Robin is a movie that embraces this cartoonism with fervor and without shame. That's why this movie deserves a glorious ten stars. The universe and superhero concept, including our beloved Batman, is often ridiculous and eccentric - things that we, comic book lovers, pretend not to see, because after all we love and will always love all this s.h.i.t like eternal children. The fact that so many hate this movie is that it just rubs these inconvenient facts in our face. Then people turn to films that mask and hide these shameful aspects, like the films of Burton and Nolan. Each one with their preferences, but I definitely continue with the Burton movies, which were dark without losing the sense of humor and without wanting to sound like a pieces of Shakespeare. Meanwhile, Batman & Robin lights up my days making me laugh and The Dark Knight leaves me with depression."

3245,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Generally considered one of the worst things ever brought to the screen, Batman & Robin is very fun. When people say this movie is terrible, I agree but they never acknowledge the redeeming qualities, which are what make this movie bad. Doesn't make much sense? Arnold delivers cheesy puns and one-liners galore, they do suck but are hilarious at the same time. George Clooney does such a bad job, you can't help laughing. Everybody is so over-the-top and cheesy, you have to laugh. That may be why Chris O'Donnell's and Silverstone's careers were pretty much ruined after this: gets recognized for Scent of a Woman; breaks out in Batman Forever; then gets screwed in this. Silverstone does some music videos, breaks out in Clueless, then gets screwed by this. All other actors pretty much had their feet firmly planted. The set design and special effects were actually well-done. But people criticized this portion for being too weird-looking and overly-extravagant. Maybe they were, but doing all that the way Schumacher did is extremely difficult. Plus it saves us from the bad story and bad acting. I did say the acting is funny, but after a while it gets to be too much. It starts off fun, but eventually gets boring since there is no good plot or characters. It just keeps going until you have enough. I know that two hours isn't very long for a movie, but in this case, it was. Just take twenty minutes away and it would have been better.

3246,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"i suppose you could say this movie is the low point in the franchise.i mean,while watching the movie i kept thinking it was basically a two hour movie of the 1960's camp classic classic with Adam west and Burt Ward.i found it hard to take the movie very seriously,considering there were so many one liners,most of them corny,but some quite funny.also the movie was very special effects laden,to say the least.the characters all seemed to be just parodies of themselves.George Clooney Donned the cape for this incarnation,and i have to agree with another reviewer who said he seemed to be playing George Clooney.i don't think he had quit the right look for Batman,but then again,neither did the movie.there were some good things about the movie.Uma Thurman was one,in the role of villainess Poison Ivy.she looked great and i loved her accent.i found it strangely seductive.Alicia Silverstone Played BatGirl.she looked good in her skintight outfit.she's cute too.Chris O'Donnell returns as Robin,and once again,i really loved the look of his suit at the beginning,not so much the one he had later in the film.i didn't like Batman's costume too much at all.i thought it just looked silly.oh,yeah,Arnie was in this one and received top billing as the evil genius Mr Freeze.basically he just fired his gun at everything and everyone and froze whatever was in his way.they even imagined to make arkham asylum look non foreboding. this whole new look Batman may have been the point to the movie.maybe it was all deliberate,but i think if that's the case,the experiment backfired.people hated this movie.i didn't hate it.i found it entertaining but very light as far as Batman goes.guess i would give it a 6/10 just for entertainment value."
3247,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"""Batman & Robin"" (1997) is the fourth part of the modern Batman series, directed again by popcorn movie director Joel Schumacher (""Batman Forever"", 1995) and starring George Clooney as Batman after Val Kilmer has left the series after only one Batman movie. Like his predecessor, ""Batman & Robin"" is leaving the original roots of Tim Burton's darker two Batman movies and moves more towards mainstream action and a more family-friendly fantasy adventure.

Clooney's Bruce Wayne is much straighter and funnier than the psychologically disturbed and existentialist Batman performances by Michael Keaton and Val Kilmer. Although it reveals a bit more about Wayne's relationship to his butler and father-like friend Alfred, Clooney lacks the psychological depths of the first three movies.

Chris O'Donnell returns for a second time as his sidekick Robin, appearing more like a wild rock'n'roll youngster than like a despaired artist's orphan out for bloody revenge. like in ""Batman Forever"". Alicia Silverstone's Batgirl takes the same way, being only a female Robin version, adding more sex to the superhero's league.

This time, it's the villain's turn to show more psychological characters and sad background stories. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the real main actor of the movie, plays Mr. Freeze, a mentally and physically damaged scientist who became a super villain only to rescue the life of his beloved coma-state wife. He's no real bad guy, and it's his final turn to save the life of Gotham City.

Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy has not only the function of a men-killing black widow but also the motivation of protecting the ecological balance of nature on earth. Her appearances are sometimes really stunning, taking fashion, music and dances of the tiki, lounge and exotica movement of the fifties and adding a campy b-movie touch to this mainstream movie.

You see, compared to the first three Batman movies, the bad guys are rather good guys and have more interesting biographies like the good guys, this time with less personal problems and more shiny, muscle-dominated rubber suits on their hard-bodies. This could have been much more interesting, just like in Tim Burton's Batman movies.

Another low point is the rather uninteresting image of the city of Gotham City - being a perfect background in the first three movies with elements of hammer horror castles, dark nightmare cities, a German expressionist-like modern ""Metropolis"" and an adaption of the disturbing paintings of Hieronimus Bosch or Enrico de Chirico, Schumachers Gotham City is just a dead background painting without the breeding darkness of the Burton movies.

The sound track is well done, ripping of Danny Elfman's well-known leitmotif and adding some very fine alternative, pop and techno tunes of the Smashing Pumpkins, Underworld, R. Kelly and Moloko to the story.

All in all it's the most mainstream-like and the most disappointing part of the new Batman movie series, but still much fun to watch (especially the buddy movie-like conversations between Batman and Robin). I hope they will return to Burton's original style in the forthcoming fifth part."
3248,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I was born in 1985 and Honestly, Batman & Robin as a young boy was one of my favorite ""Batmans"" of all time. I loved the casting and loved george clooney's style as both bruce wayne and batman. But it was seeing all these other actors as well that really made the movie so great. The almost overly comfortable roles they filled felt very much as the original vision seen in the 1960's Batman TV series which was something I felt was a true resemblance as batman and how he should be portrayed. Batman was originally created as a superhero icon for children and comic book readers as a part of story time, and has since been changed to a sort of ""serious suspense and too ""realistic"" adult entertainment. I much preferred the more ""comic"" and childlike entertainment that batman and robin was. I am disgusted the the more recent ""remakes"" are considered better but I guess they are no longer marketed to the same age group, so I get why ""some say it's the worst batman when really it was the bes"

3259,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I am a major hardcore fan of the Tim Burton Batman films, because IMO those films portray the character and his world the best, even better then the newer Batman Begins. the first Batman film was amazing, it set the standard for most comic book films made since, and had amazing performances by jack nicholson and michael keaton, who is still for me the definitive Batman actor. the sequel Batman Returns is my favorite because it actually managed to top the original for BEING original and not just a copy and paste of the first film. it also had a GREAT emotional edge not seen before or since in comic book film, and really made you feel for the characters, unlike the first film where it was just nutto joker and downer batman as usual. but the new batman was just boring, plain and simple. in fact, its batman begins that prompted me to write a review of the this movie, because of my dislike for the new batman. i recently bought the Batman Anthology on DVD because i love all the Batman films, even the silly campy Schumacher ones. for me, there is always something to love about these batman films, heck, even the new one. i am not a comic book reader, i hate the comics. i just never got into them. but the movies really ROCK! i love the movies, and will always hope that they make more. however, this particular batman movie gets the most hate, and i can clearly see why, but i think it gets too harshly criticized when this film is indeed a heck of a lot of fun, full of laughs, over the top action and stunts, and really feels like a comic book out of the 60's or 50's that its based. George Clooney is OK when hes batman, though hes not really what you would call ""badass"" or ""cool"", but his suit looks amazing and makes him looks very cool even with the nipples, which i never noticed before until all these nerds started brining them up. i still don't mind them. and lets just say that i can tolerate Clooney's batman more because his voice is more easy to listen as batman, unlike the recent Christian bale, who sounded like he had to have his voice altered by computers with a mixture of dogs barking and engines turning over. Clooney's wayne can be annoying at times, always smirking like a loser, i hated those parts. but it didn't ruin the film. the villains are fun and cool (no pun intended), especially Arnold who plays a wickedly hysterical Mr.Freeze, he practically steals the movie with his pretty hysterically bad puns and one liners and freeze suit, which also looks amazing. Uma Thurman as poison ivy is not really that good, shes just not a good looking woman to me, so i never found her sexy or attractive all that much, and shes very over the top, which made me kinda cringe at times. robin is, well, robin. hes constantly whining about Bruce not trusting him, but i didn't mind him. i mean, hes Robin. i'd expect that from robin too. Alicia Silverstone is the weak spot, i really wasn't nuts about her character, and i always hated Bat girl to begin with. but shes OK, she doesn't ruin the film. shes not that bad when shes finally becomes batgirl, but the film could have done without her character or batgirl. the new batmobile is awesome, its more like a kids toy but heck, i owned it as a kid so i always thought it was cool, even though it had no hood which was strange, but at least it still retained that Batmobile hotrod look we are used too, unlike that new horrible piece of crap the Tumbler, which is just a tank and looks horrendous as a batmobile. anyways, batman and robin is also very colorful, which is a stark contrast to the Tim Burton films which were more realistic and dark, and not very bright at all. i like that look, but the colors in this one don't hurt the film. not very batman-y, but the film is so much fun it doesn't even matter. and the batmobile isn't the only bat-vehicle thats new, you got robins Redbird motorcycle, Batgirls cycle, and my personal favorite, the Bathammer, batmans new toy that can slide over ice and take out villains! cool moment with all 3 vehicles. all in all, i didn't hate this film as much as i used too, its actually quite fun, and funny too! i also would NOT count this movie as any kind of sequel to the Tim Burton masterpieces, nor would i say batman forever is sequel, they are there own thing, not sequels. i mean seriously, can you compare B&R to the burton movies? i didn't think so. but this movie is still a fun bat-filled ride!"
3260,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I hate consumer purists. I think purism is ignorant. I also hate sacred cows. I refuse to watch any film, or go into any artwork, with notions of how such and such is ""supposed to be"". If I could write and direct my own Batman film, Batman would be a geriatric transvestite who cuts down villains with a lawn mower. There would be a lot of bloody lawnmower deaths in the film. The batsuit would be a combination of a fur dress with ""real"", huge bat wings and a feminized baseball uniform. Batman would have fangs, eat insects and always sit or sleep upside down. Gotham City would be a small town in Oklahoma and Alfred would be a midget who is older than God and who has a horseshoe fetish. He'd go around naked and barefoot, except he'd have horseshoes on his feet. The Batmobile would be a bicycle. Batman would flap his big, stinky bat wings while he peddles. I'd have a villain who looks like the Penguin but who drives a pick-up truck with a shotgun in the rear window and chews tobacco. He'd spit it out into a bottle, and he'd have a huge collection of bottles in a warehouse full of refrigerators. I'd have a villain like Poison Ivy who dates the Mayor's teenaged daughter. Batman would dance with Poison Ivy and her girlfriend at a hoedown. They'd eat barbecued chicken while they dance, then lick the sauce off of each other's clothes. This wouldn't be intended as a spoof, and it's not that I dislike the Batman character--he's one of my favorite fictional characters.

So you can see how director Joel Schumacher's changes to the Batman characters, production design and tone of the film wouldn't put me off of Batman & Robin. I like artists to do things differently, to express themselves. That doesn't mean that I want to make them slaves to the ""cult of originality""--maybe they feel strongly about keeping some or most things ""traditional"", and that's fine. My main requirement is that they do something that they think is artistically valuable. And for me to like what they do, I have to find it interesting, enjoy it, or get something in the way of aesthetic or philosophical worth from it. I definitely find Batman & Robin interesting, I enjoy most of it, and it is very aesthetically pleasing to me. I do think there are a couple flaws. But they're minor enough to only bring my rating down to an 8.

Batman (George Clooney) & Robin (Chris O'Donnell) have to battle two villains, Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman). Mr. Freeze is a scientist who went wacko when his wife acquired a terminal disease and he fell into a vat of cryogenic liquid. His primary ambition is to save his wife's life and make everyone else suffer along with him while he waits by freezing them--literally turning them into big peoplecicles. Poison Ivy is a psycho environmentalist who wants to turn the world back over to plants, but only after she's given plants animal characteristics, so if you try to do any weeding, they'll bite your bummies off. At the same time, Alfred (Michael Gough) is sick, and his hot niece, Barbara Wilson (Alicia Silverstone) comes to visit. The film features various scenarios of Batman & Robin trying to capture Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy, and alternates this with relationship explorations between Batman, Robin, Alfred and Barbara.

For my money, Batman & Robin has the best beginning of any of the Batman films to date. I love the frozen Warner Brothers logo. I love the segue into garish colors that look like Super Elastic Bubble Plastic. I love the sequence of body-part close-ups with the camp and homoerotic factor cranked up to 11. And I love the kick-ass extended action sequence that's as intense as the climax to most films and that features Batman and Robin playing ice hockey and then boogie-boarding on rocket ship parts at 30,000 feet. That just rocks.

And things remain at a high level for some time. At least the first half of this film is a solid 10 to me. I'm a fan of George Clooney, and the bizarre casting of him as Batman is a stroke of genius in my book. The only better Batman would have been Tiny Tim, but he died during the production of Batman & Robin, so it's good they didn't cast him. I'm also a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger. He would have been a good Batman, too, but he's also excellent as Mr. Freeze.

I like Gotham City better here than in any of the other films, at least architecturally. Schumacher makes the city huge and gives us constant eye candy. The other Gotham Cities may have had attractive atmospheres, but this one I'm pining to visit. I'd love to explore it. I want to race down that highway. I want to visit that observatory. The production designer, Barbara Ling, shouldn't have just received an Oscar for her work--you should be sending her your firstborn.

I love the humor in the film. As I've noted many times, I'm a huge fan of the Adam West ""Batman"" (1966). Schumacher makes a firm commitment to that level of camp in this film. Some scenes here are simply hilarious, like Mr. Freeze yelling at his cronies to sing along with Snow Miser song from The Year Without Santa Claus (1974). Schumacher also does interesting things with the extremely twisted family metaphors of Batman, Robin, Alfred, and Barbara. And I love the colors.

In fact, the only real problem I have with this film is that Schumacher slightly loses the plot focus about halfway through. It begins to seem more like a collection of set pieces than a taut story. But the set pieces work (except for some clunkiness in the logic of the climax), and the film is excellent otherwise."

3264,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Come on people this movie was not that bad. Actually I think this was my favorite of the Batman movies. I guess it's because I am not a fan of the Batman comic books but a fan of the 1966 Tv Series and cartoon like Superfriends.

Look at the vote graph. 28% give this movie a 1. Do you really think it is that bad? It's the comic book people who sound off on this movie because Batman aint as dark as he appears in the comic book or the first couple of movies. Actually it was the darkness that I disliked about the first couple of movies. You got people bashing Robin. They don't want him in this movie. When Robin was introduced in the third movie, I said about time. Enough of this dark stuff. It's time to lighten this sucker up.

As for the casting. I liked it better than any of the others - although Nicholson as the Joker was pretty good and Pfeiffer as Catwoman was good. I guess the casting of the villians has always been pretty good except for the Penguin. And even there it wasn't Devito's fault. I personally can't understand anyone who doesn't like Arnold as Mr Freeze. To me he was wonderful in that role. I am also not the biggest George Cooney fan but he was the best of the Batmans from this series. The other casting in this movie was good too. I read someone say how could Batman and Robin be fighting for Uma Thurman. Are you watching the movie??? She is able to put a spell on them. Before this movie I didn't even know who Poison Ivy was and I liked her character. The only drawback character was Batgirl.

I will repeat it again. I loved this movie. It was better than the first three Batmans. My only gripe (besides Batgirl) is that these (all four) Batman movies spend too much time introducing new characters. But the reason this movie worked for me was it was 'lighter' and visually it was a much prettier film. I guess I like my Batman not so demented.

This movie is definitely not one of the worst 100 ever. Come on 28% ones. There is biasness going on here from the you know who's."
3265,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I remember when I first saw this movie. I guess it would have been my sophomore year of high school. I saw it around the same time I saw 'Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,' which was truly beyond bad. I thought it was TERRIBLE.

I just recently went back to this movie because it was on Starz. I must say, I was entirely entertained. I also respect the movie more than I did.

I discovered new entertainment value when I recognized that the movie isn't even TRYING to be a good Batman film. It knows itself to be ridiculous, and it doesn't take itself seriously because of it. In fact, the movie doesn't take anything seriously. It's silly from beginning to end.

It achieves exactly what it is trying to be, and for that it deserves credit. It's camptacular, with over-the-top special effects, costumes, and one-liners. Many people derided it for being a special-effects driven film, but I disagree. I think the special effects exist to drive the stupidity. The wilder the effects, the more unrealistic it all is, and the funnier it gets. It is a stupidity driven film.

This is what the 60's TV show would have been with a massive budget. It understands that everything about Batman is silly, and it takes that to its logical end. The bad guys are even more out there than the first Batman movies, the dialogue wouldn't seem out of place at a beach party, and the Batmobile is just, well, you'll have to see.

The cinematography is great, the set design is beautifully over the top, and the colors could keep a person high on meth occupied. The script is terrible, and there really isn't any plot, but that doesn't matter. It's not even part of the equation.

They took everything campy about action movies and distilled it down to this. And for that, it deserves credit. Once I let go of what I expected from a Batman movie, and stopped judging it based on what I thought should be in the film, and just let me experience it as any other film I may come across, I really rather fell for it.

I enjoyed this movie more than 'Batman Begins,' which is certainly a far better film by most measures, but is missing that je'ne se quas of a film that perfectly embodies what it's trying to be. 'Batman Begins' was patently absurd (a secret society of ninjas??), but it took itself gravely seriously. This movie is even more absurd, and it absolutely revels in it. I think that makes it the better film.

But that's just my opinion."
3266,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"It started out so spectacular with Tim Burton's two first films about the man dressed as a bat. Then it got a bit off the track with Batman Forever, but Batman & Robin was almost unwatchable. I've always been a Schwarzenegger fan, because he had his own way of doing things, but watching him as Mr. Freeze, always trying to be fun and do nothing but crack off jokes is unbearable. The Batman franchise has gone from lurking darkness to annoying oneliners, which cuts my heart.

And what's with BatGirl? What in the name of the freakin' lord is she doing in the movie? Alicia Silverstone is not a bad actress, she just doesn't fit in here - She looks way too confused and never finds her role.

So don't see it at all. On the other hand, this movie is rip roaring fun when you don't expect such a serious movie in the first place. With over the top acting, robin getting frozen mid-air to bat puns, plant puns, ice puns and bird (robin) puns, 'bat' credit cards (expiration date FOREVER as in Batman forever. Get it? Yuk Yuk Yuk) and Arnie as Mr.Freeze, how can you go wrong? Sure its kind of an insult and parody if you're one of those serious batman fans but if you don't take everything so seriously, this movie is a riot and entertainment wise, the best in the series. Sorry dude"
3269,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Man, y'all probably saw Flash Gordon and thought, ""Well, that was stupid."" I can't even give Batman and Robin my usual good bad movie rating of 5 because it was actually trying to be campy. And it succeeds! The one-liners are ridiculous, the villains are cartoonish, and its all on a big budget. And sometimes, the silly tropes of comic books need to be laughed at.

While Chris O'Donnell was annoying, most other complaints can be answered with ""Its not supposed to be taken seriously!"" Ice puns? Hockey fights? Bat credit cards? They all contribute to the light-hearted mood. If anything, it could have had more jokes.

Why do people complain about this over Batman Forever? Batman Forever was both too serious and too campy. Even if Batman and Robin went in a direction most fans didn't like, at least it was interesting and consistent. If anything ruined the franchise, it was Forever.

I thought the movie was fun. As manufactured bad, you can riff on it with friends with little dead air. Lighten up a little, bros. We don't need dark and gritty every comic book flick."
3270,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I do not think that films based on comic characters need to be taken very seriously, as though they were serious literature. Comics are for short-term entertainment, and so are films based on such comics. And if a film brings out a comic character successfully in cinematographic form, it may be considered an achievement. I review Batman & Robin in the context of earlier Batman movies and latter Dark Knight series. Here goes..

I believe that Batman & Robin is a fast-paced entertainer, with groovy action, crisp, double-meaning dialog, bright comic costumes, sly innuendos and a 'feel-good' feeling at the end. Arnie excels as Mr Freeze, and so does Uma as Poison Ivy. The antics of these two, throughout the film, amply compensate for the film's weaknesses: Clooney is a boring Batman, and Alicia as Batgirl, is thoroughly annoying. Chris, as Robin, has the usual problems of teenagers, viz. rebellion to any form of authority, awakening sexuality and lack of experience in worldly matters. No big deal. However, compared to the dull and depressing Batman films of Keaton or Kilmer, or the literally 'dark' Batman films of Bale, this one is racy.. it does not take itself too seriously.. it does not explore hidden meanings, psychological problems or world domination. It is surfeit with bright, wacky, comic characters from the DC Universe, and its sole aim is to entertain. And entertain it does."
3271,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"This movie is like a modern version of the original TV-series! It doesn't take itself seriously, and the actors seems to have a lot of fun while doing their overacting. It's pretty fun, and has great effects (for its time). The moronic use of a great character (Bain - just read Knightfall to see what I mean), and the decision to include Silverstone, are two sore points though. Anyway, if you don't care about continuity, and if you are willing to see the movie for what it is - a modern take of the 50:s-60:s version of Batman, then it's not that bad.

I haven't seen Batman Begins yet, but I'm looking forward to it. After a series of over the top Batman movies, it's time to get down to earth. a grittier, more serious batman. I believe it's going to be great, probably the best of the Batman movies. But this movie isn't that horrible, just different.

A nice rental. Best served with lots of beer and some popcorn."
3272,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"What 's the matter with you people ? OK I understand if English talking people dislike the movie because it has many silly pans , especially by Mr Freeze e.g. "" Let 's kick some ice "" . But I cannot understand why European viewers have slaughtered the film so much . Alright I admit that the jokes are beyond silly but who CARES ? This is not a comedy it is an adventure and it should be treated like that .

What 's the story ? Batman ( George Clooney ) and Robin ( Chris O' Donnell ) must face a new threatening villain , the ice - cold Mr Freeze ( Arnold Schwarzenegger ) . Dr Victor Fries as it is his real name is , was a brilliant scientist who was forced to put his wife Nora in cryogenic condition until he could find a cure for her rare disease. An unfortunate accident ( falling into a vat of freezing solution ) disfigured him irrepairably . He can now survive only under extremely cold conditions . So he has developed an armoured suit which keeps his body temperature below zero . He also invented a freezing gun which can make his victums solid ice crystals . So he begins a crusade to freeze the entire world . Halfway he forms an uneasy alliance with the deadly charming Poison Ivy ( Uma Thurman ) a mutated creature with the power of bewitching men and killing them off with a poisonous kiss on the lips. Dr Pamela Isley as she was once called was a botanist working in a lab in South America . She loves plants as anything else and hates the irresponsible humans who keep raping Earth and destroying the environment . After an accident she mutates and reborn as the venomous Poison Ivy who regards herself as an incarnation of mother - nature. She wants the plants to take over the world and wants to eliminate the Caped Crusaders in order not to be in her way !

There are many other subplots but I won 't say more . The writers did a great job wrapping the 7 - 8 subplots in a neat little package . Kudos also to the director Joel Schumacher for some really inspired action sequences ( with the exception of the ice - hockey in the beginning of the film which is very stupid ) . The freezing missile , the jail breakout and the scene in Mr Freeze 's lab where he frosts the cops .This is a major improvement over the disappointing "" action "" scenes of Batman Forever ( some contrived car chases , bad shot and unsatisfactory ) .

I hate it when people say "" what a silly movie ! How rediculous idea the cold energy generating from diamonds . How ridiculous the alliance between the 2 villains ! Why the Batgirl character is now Alfred 's niece since she was Commissioner Gordon 's daughter ? Oh my God what a disgrace for the comic tradition !!!!!! "" In a strange way these are the same people who are praising the dark like hell "" Batman Returns "" . ARE YOU SERIOUS ???? If so , then do you know that the Penguin is traditionally an aristocratic arch - criminal and NOT a disfigured genetically mutant ? Did you ever wonder why Catwoman wanted to kill Batman since he saved her life ? And why did she not kill her boss instantly since he was the one she hated instead of going through all this ordeal ? She could have spared herself ( and us ) from sewing up that leather costume and fighting Batman if she simply took a gun and shot Shreque . By the way did you ever wonder where the Penguin found all these rocket missiles ? And what kind of plot is THAT ? The penguin wanting to kill all the firstborn boys of the city ??? Where did they come up with this ??? The 10 Commandments maybe ?????????????!!!!!!!!

I think I have made my point . Don 't get me wrong , I LOVE Batman Returns . But these movies are FAIRY TALES and should not be taken seriously . We should enjoy them as fairy tales . If B&R has a major flaw is the total absence of Gothism . Regard it as a break from the dark 3 previous installments . That does NOT mean is campy ( despite the corny jokes ) as many suggest . It is a very good adventure . All the performances are great , Mr Freeze is terrific is his frosted Robocop -eque appeareance gives you chills ( this is not a pan ) and basically steals the show . The sets / costumes / make -ups are virtually STUNNING and groundbreaking . The climax of the Gotham city freezing is the best action sequence in the entire series and the Batman Vs Freeze final battle is simply titanic and divine . And finally the villains are not evil . They DO have motives and you end up liking them.

Don 't listen to anyone . Even you who hate it give it another chance. Forget the c**p one - liners and the absence of dark . See it for what it IS . A great roaller - coaster with much humanism and emotion.

This movie has great action and humor. I thought George Clooney was good as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Chris O' Donnel does a good job as Robin, Alicia Silverstone does a good job as Batgirl, Uma Thurman does a good job as Poison Ivy and Arnold Schwarzenegger does a good job as Mr. Freeze. This movie has great cinematography, sets, acting, action and humor. This movie is a ride to watch. I thought this movie was better than Batman Forever.

3274,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I have seen Batman & Robin many times and that should show that it's not really all that bad.

The biggest problem with this film is that most people misunderstood it. After Tim Burton's very dark Batman films, no one would expect this. The style is completely different and instead of being dark, everything is very colorful. It's more like the 60s TV show. If this had been a movie by its self and not a sequel, maybe people wouldn't hate it so much.

Another flaw is the new character Batgirl. I will never understand why she was created. She serves no purpose and her costume looks cheap. Robin turning up in the last movie was bad enough.

A good thing this movie has is Mr. Freeze. In my opinion he is the best of Batman's villains. He is cool (Haha), likable, funny, has character and doesn't just run around laughing like the previous villains. Poison Ivy however was nothing special.

George Clooney is not Batman. He can play Bruce Wayne, but when he's wearing the bat suit he just looks like George Clooney dressed up as Batman. It looks silly. Maybe it's just the new suit. Robin's suit also looks rather silly, but it looks better than the suit he wore in the 60s. When Batman and Robin are standing next to each other at parties or crime scenes and they are not fighting, they look ridiculous. I just thought I'd point that out.

My conclusion is that this film deserves at least 5 out of 10. That's not great, but better than what a lot of people say. It's an entertaining film that should not be a sequel. Nothing more, nothing less."
3275,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I liked this movie. I must admit that it was not as good as the first two films in this series, with the dark ambience and the damaged and brooding Batman. But it is by no means awful. Now, I haven't seen the third movie, nor did I ever read the Batman comics. I did see the silly '60's TV show, and liked it at the time, but, hey, I was seven. (Surely the target audience for that.) OK, as for B & R. I didn't think that Clooney could pull off the role. He did OK, but Michael Keaton was great as Batman, something I never would have believed before seeing it. O'Donnell was also OK. Then there is Ahh-nold. A pretty cool (ha-ha) part for him. Uma Thurman played her Poison Ivy role too far over the top, with more than a few nods to Mae West. I thought Alicia Silverstone did very well, although no one else seems to think so. Maybe she is just too adorable for me see past. All in all, the script could have been better, too many zingers and one-liners. The Gotham City setting was a bit much. The direction seemed OK, meaning I never thought of the director at any time while viewing the show.

Looking over this, it seems full of criticism, and doesn't convey why I enjoyed the movie. Well, I don't really know why. But I did."
3276,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I for one loved this movie I've seen all live action batman's(excluding the horrible horrible fan made crap) yes The new batman's with christen bale are awesome but nothing beat a classic this movie is amazing and right up to pare with the first 3 it truly gives you The DC Comic feel witch i thought was great and BANE let me tell you if you watched the new dark knight the Bane in this movie would eat that guy for dinner BANE IS BIG HES BAD AND HE KICKS ASS witch is how banes suppose to be hes and x-con and a big dumb brute Never once was bane a criminal mastermind in the comics he was always there to pummel bats wile the real master mind killed stole and made his escape. This movie like the first 3 were all great comic based movies fun to watch with the kids and stuck true to the dc comic yes maybe clooney wasn't the best choice for batman i personally liked val kilmer better but that's just me.

SO ignore all the shitty reviews and watch it for yours self keeping in mind not to compare it to the Dark-knight Trilogy but to the DC Comics we all know and love"
3277,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Personally I don't understand why a lot of people are against this movie. It is good and entertaining. I've watched it over 5 times and my opinion has not changed. Infamous actors, great sound and visual effects, enjoyable storyline...easily not to be missed. First you have to realize that this is a fantasy movie. Simply put, never expect any 'realism', it's absolutely foolish to do that. The more it defies from reality, the better. Fantasy movie has no limitation. Well, with so much features to be 'unreal', this movie has it all to be a decent fantasy one.

Joel Schumacher has bravely changed the fundamental image of Batman series. It used to be 'dark' (hence the nickname 'Dark Knight')but in this movie it receives a significant facelift, it no longer features a bleak world. Nighttime (Dark) is still a major setting, but it is now brighter and more colorful. Batman himself is no longer helplessly haunted by his own past and lamenting on his tragic fate (hey, he's a superhero anyway, why should he do that kind of thing?), he is now grown more optimistic . And unlike its predecessors, which featured more 'serious' atmosphere (to the extent that they even resembled thriller movies), it is now significantly de-emphasized, and so far, it becomes the only Batman movie most appeal to the whole family. What a surprise with all that, but personally I am happy. Finally, a stronger and 'happier' Batman character appears...

OK, many Batman fans may curse Schumacher for his infidelity, for his attempts on 'ruining' the images of Batman. But again, do remember about the 'fantasy'. It has no limits. Batman has indeed changed, but in a positive way. Great work, Schumacher. For this reason, I regret that the sequel (Batman Triumphant, also by Schumacher and still features Clooney) was never produced, instead it receives a reboot (Batman Begins), and return to its original dark flair. Alas, I can no longer see the 'happy' Batman.

Blame it on Bob Kane - for he was who created Batman with all austerity and forlorn sides the hero is well-known for. Schumacher was just tried to grant Batman a new breathe of life with optimism and happiness this hero deserves - he is an ordinary human being nonetheless.

One simple advice for those who want to watch this movie: sit back, relax, and enjoy all this movie has to offer. Just do not bother do the 'damn,it's not the same Batman I know' thinking, just enjoy our hero on his entirely different shape. You will like it."
3278,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"OK, look, I realize that it was corny, and was most likely unnecessary to include in the series, but you know what? Enough with this the load of bull that you're feeding Joel Schumacher about this movie, I liked it. It was the best Batman in terms of lines and characters, and it was funny!!! In my mind, this is a somewhat comical film. My personal favorite was Chris O'Donnell with ""NOW WHAT, CALL A TAXI?"" I was actually making a list of what I thought were the 100 funniest films ever, and I considered putting Batman & Robin at around 90. And let Freeze kick some ice while he can. I don't think anyone will ever agree what with I'm about to say, but I really believe this was a step from Val Kilmer's Batman Forever. Enough with bashing this movie, it was very good.

If you want a deep meaningful movie, this isn't in the same league as the original Batman movie, however if you want pure and simple entertainment, then this film is for you.

In any case, I don't think any of the Batman movies have been good, though I didn't see #2 because I HATED Michael Keaton in the first one. I liked Val, and George was all right. My biggest problem with this movie, aside from the usual gooey cheese, was how whiny Chris O'Donnell was. I mean, I just wanted to smack him with his ""You're just jealous because she wants me"" crap that Robin said over and over and over, until I wished Poison Ivy would just kiss him and poison him. His cuteness could not compensate for his obnoxiousness. Hopefully, if they make another one of these movies, which I'm sure they will, they'll make him less of a bra"

Made in the same vein as the classic 60's TV series, this is an enjoyable romp which doesn't take itself too seriously. You can tell the cast had a blast making this movie.

Pay no attention to the naysayers - this movie is a lot of fun. George Clooney makes a terrific Batman, Uma Thurman is to die for and Governor Arnie hams it up as Mr Freeze. All 3 were very well chosen.

There were of course downsides. Alicia Silverstone. Need I say more? The poor girl should've stuck to Aerosmith videos where she just had to look pretty and not say anything.

I want to thank the cast and crew members for making Batman and Robin so much fun - it is assured cult status. Lovin' it!"
3288,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"It's really too bad that so many nerds have taken ahold of the notion that Batman is a grim, psychologically-challenged character. While somewhat flawed, this take on Batman is more in line with the character than Tim Burton's versions. The villains are colorful, the heroes are courageous, and a lot of the dislike for this film is nonsense!!!!!!!! Joel Schumacher's take is a blend of the 1940s and 1970s Batman adventures. As far as Batgirl is concerned, he did the best he could. It is not his fault that Barbara Gordon is in a wheel chair in the comic books. Despite all that is said about the movie, I am glad it made a profit for the studio. If you want to see a good, over-the-top action pic, this is i"

great performances throughout the whole cast. This movie also

had more action than the last 3 movies too. I remember a lot of

Freeze's one liners are great. Poison Ivy, played by Uma Thurman, is a good villian. George Clooney is a better Batman than Val Kilmer, but Chris'O'Donnell stunk in this as Robin. As far as Alicia Silverstone is concerned, she can't act in the first plac"
3291,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I enjoyed all four of the earlier Batman movies, even with the Musical Batmans of the last two, First Val Kilmer then George Clooney. But what I liked about this one - In THIS rendition, they returned to Bob Kane's original imagery for Gotham City. I understand this is probably the least popular of the four original films, but I still like it, much more than I ever expected to like it.

And of course, this film of all four is most like the original Batman TV show from the 60's which I loved - Mr Freeze, Poison Ivy, Bane, all LOOK like they looked in the comics. They talked like the comics, they acted like comic book characters, because that's what they are.

I would have cast Arnold Schwarzenegger as Bane and not Mr Freeze, but then again, Bane had no lines, only grunts and occasional parroting of other lines.

The Cityscape of Gotham City is Teutonic and Outrageous, you have to love it. Can you imagine a City that has Monolithic Statues with transit expressways running through them? Can you imagine an Observatory built on the outstretched hands of a huge statue? And Arkham Asylum as well. This is a Gotham City that matches in a lot of ways some of the Detective Comics of the 40's in imagery and spirit.

Of course this is a silly movie - But I loved Arnold's Mr Freeze, Uma's Poison Ivy- There were even cameos by Ralf Moeller and Jesse Ventura. There is even a small part by Doug Hutchison aka ""Tooms"". the Contorting, liver-eating guy from The X Files.

If you want Two Hours and Five Minutes of nothing but pure Detective Comics, then this has it. It's best to just sit back and let this film be what it was intended to be, I've seen it a few times as well as just now and I have always enjoyed it. This is less like Frank Miller's Dark Night graphical novel and more like the comics from the 60's which is when I first picked up a Batman comic. And this is not at all like the first Tim Burton version, which had Batman using Machine Guns - The main aspect of Batman from the Comics, is that he never uses guns and he never kills anyone.

Chris Nolan's Trilogy was based more on Frank Miller's vision of The Dark Night, and even that version would not have Batman ever killing a man - But he would ""Not have to save him"" as he does to ""Ras Al Ghul"".

So I highly enjoyed this, even as much as the first two and as much as Nolan's trilogy. It's worth it just to see Uma prance around in Green Leotard."

3293,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I don't seem to understand why everybody hates this Batman movie. Is it Arnold as Mr. Fries? Alicia as Batgirl?? What???? First off, I happen to like Batman and Robin. Secondly if I put the four movies in order to my liking, Batman Forever comes right after the first one with Keaton and Nickolson. Why am I telling you this?? Because that is the point in time everybody said the 90s franchise went sour. Next time you watch this movie listen to the dialog that Jim Carrey shares with Tommy Lee. It's actually funny and witty at the same time. The idea of Jim being in tights just adds to the effect of how crazy the Riddler is. To me he's just the opposite of the character of the Joker. Different kind of humor and everything. Out of the four films, this one has some of the best lines that I like to quote.

Batman and Robin on the other hand to me only has one draw back - Cloony. Can these actors act together and pull it off?? Yes! I think the reason for the stupidity of the movie is Poision Ivy. The actress has to be sadistic, beautiful, cunning and crude.

So, why the big deal????"
3294,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"While it's far from the greatest film of all time, Batman & Robin isn't nearly as bad as some people have made it out to be.

Batman, Batman Returns, and Batman Forever were dark and gothic which is the dominant ""mood"" for the world of Batman, but Batman & Robin was campy because it was more or less a big screen adaptation of the 1960's Batman TV series.

IMO, I believe bad word of mouth is what made this film less of a blockbuster than it's monstrously successful predecessors. People were expecting a dark and gothic film with Batman & Robin but when word got out that it was lighter and more easy going than the other films, people who hadn't seen it thought ""Oh, well if it isn't dark like the other movies, it isn't worth seeing."" and that's why it wasn't a big time blockbuster. It still made ALOT of money though.

As a long time Batman fan(I've been a fan of the Dark Knight since I was a kid), I realize that Batman evolves from time to time so that he can sustain interest from fans and the general public as well. For many years he can be dark and gothic, as Bob Kane intended him to be, or he can be light and fun. Either way Batman has always been a badass and in Batman & Robin, Joel Schumacher chose to show us the lighter side of the Batman mythos while still staying moderately true to the comics.

The film parallels Batman Forever in many ways. For instance in the beginning, we see the heroes suiting up to confront the latest threat to Gotham City. A big action sequence ensues and then things quiet down and from there on, it's a roller coaster ride of a movie. It follows the same formula as Batman Forever in terms of action and character development.

I saw Batman & Robin on it's opening night during summer 1997 and I loved every minute of it. From the action and adventure to the heartwarming scenes between Alfred and Bruce to the scheming villians it was a great thrill ride. A great film? Well depends. It certainly isn't The Godfather, Star Wars, Citizen Kane, or any other monumental film but it was great in terms of entertainment value.

Anyway, really great comic book film. If people had realized early on before the film's release that it was going to be more of a update of the 60's Batman TV show then I believe it would have been even more of a success than it already was.

Not the best Batman movie but again, not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be."

There is no such thing as real Batman, and serious Batman story with some deeper meaning, that should require. BATMAN IS A KIDS FICTIONAL MOV"
3297,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I actually really liked Batman and Robin. I think it was mindless fun. I can understand why so many hardcore Batman fans didn't like it, because of the new direction this was heading, but I also think that many just bash it because of the overall bad reviews. I understand that Batman and Robin is not as good as the first two movies, but a lot better than the dreadful Batman Forever. What I liked about it? Well, first and foremost I think George Clooney was a good choice. He really did a great job (Keaton is still the best). He was way better than Val Kilmer (which I love in so many other roles). I also liked Chris O'Donnell as Robin. I think they had great chemistry as the evil fighting duo. Way better than in Batman Forever anyways. The only problem was that they made him so wimpy. It was annoying sometimes. The best thing about Batman and Robin are the villains. Poison Ivy, perfect! Uma Thurman was exquisite as the femme fatal. She didn't overact IMO. She always seemed to know how far she could go with her character. I feared we might would have another Jim Carrey debacle on our hands, but she really knew how to pull it off and had some pretty cool lines. Arnold Schwarzenegger was hilarious. I am from Austria so of course I am a little biased. The only thing that bothered me where the many one-liners. It was a little over the top. Bane, well I agree that he is not the Bane from the comics, but this is not Schumachers fault. Wanner Brothers forced him to use a popular and well-known villain as Poison Ivy's sidekick. This way they could sell more toys. To bring in Batgirl wasn't the smartest move, since everyone had to get used to the Batman and Robin team first. It felt like all those different characters were stuffed down our throat. This again, was not Schumachers fault. Warner Brothers forced him to use Batgirl, since they wanted to sell as many action figures as possible. Alicia Silverstone is a very good actress, but in Batman and Robin she seemed to be on heavy medication. It really was an overall bad performance. I could picture her as Batgirl but she seemed somehow distracted. I once read somewhere that Alicia didn't even have to audition. She got the role because of her contract with Paramount (?). Many people didn't like that Batgirl was suddenly the niece of Alfred. Since being forced by Warner Brothers to use her in the first place, this was the only way Schumacher could have done it. There where already too many characters and if he would have went by the comic there would have been a lot more explanation necessary. This way also Alfred got a larger role, so znder the given circumstances I think this problem was solved in a very uncomplicated way. What bothered a lot ofpeople were all the shots of the gadgets and the costumes. Again,Warner Brothers wanted to use this as a commercial for selling all this as toys. Some shots really felt like a commercial, but Joel Schumacher didn't decide to do it this way. Warner Brothers wanted to make this more children friendly to appeal to a larger audience. All the toys were already made before the movie was even halfway finished. Schumacher had to stick to everything studio bosses decided. He just tried to make the best of it and I think he did.

All in all, yes it looks like a cartoon, bright colors and the settings are over the top and the movie has a campy look, but with all the pressure from studio bosses, who where only trying to exploit the movie as much as possible, I think Joel Schumacher did a good job. People should just watch it for what it tried to be. Mindless action and fun. BTW, the special effects still look great nowadays.

I know a many think Batman and Robin was a flop, but they are mistaken. It almost doubled its production cost. I know that a movie is only considered ''a hit'' if it doubles its budget, but there IS something in the middle. Nowadays it seems every movie has to be a major hit otherwise it is immediately a failure. Batman and Robin WAS a successful movie. Nothing more and nothing less.

And to the Razzie Awards: It was ridiculous to nominate Uma Thurman, Clooney and O'Donnell. There were FAR worse performances that year. But the Razzies always go with the hype anyways."
3298,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,I think that this is one of the best films out of the Batman Movies. OK so George Clooney wasn't the best Batman (Micheal Keaton was) but the other villains in Batman Returns - Penguin and Catwoman were just pointless. Poison Ivy has got to be the 3rd best villain behind Joker and Riddler. Anyone who says that Joel Schumacer butchered it needs to watch it again. Mr Freeze could have been made better but I don't think it was that bad. Arnie Swartzenneger played him well. And Chris o Donnell and Alicia Silverstone were good sidekicks although she could have had a better name than BATGIRL. That was pretty lame. So the Best Batman was the original but this one is no where near as bad as everyone makes o
3299,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Hi - I'm surprised that everyone is jumping on the ""I hate this movie"" bandwagon. True, it was campy. True, parts of it were ridiculous. But look at the other 3 Batman movies - they weren't all that hot either - the things I liked about this - the relationship between Alfred and Bruce was good (this was the first time I could stomach the Alfred character), Arnold was 2-dimensional at times, but funny as hell, they stuck Jason Woodrue in as a character, and Clooney did good as both Bruce and Batman - Val was a great Bruce and an ok Bat - Keaton was the best Batman and a horrible Bruce. In any case, it really isn't a bad flick - I have about 3000 Batman comics, read 'em all, they haven't made A ""true"" Batman movie, but for the four that they have made - I'd rank this as #2 of the 4 - first being Batman (an 8 of 10), this one I rank a ""7"" and the two others ""7's"" as well. Don't listen to the ""HATE BANDWAGON,"" give it a shot, if you're a Batman fan, you'll find a lot to like.

3300,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"The much-maligned Batman and Robin, while doubtlessly the worst of Batman movies, does not deserve its abysmal reputation. It does feature some incredibly cheesy lines, stupid jokes (esp. the one about the Poison Ivy action figure), and a plot that's somewhat improbable even for a children-aimed comic book. While I prefer the ""brooding Batman"" side of the Caped Crusader, I have no compunctions against the light-hearted approach, and Batman and Robin is over-the-top enough to be funny. The film's got some nice displays of acting from Michael Gough and Arnold Schwarzenegger - his talents as an actor are vastly underrated, and, while too clownish as Mr. Freeze, Schwarz puts on a convincing and compassionate display of Dr. Fries' affection for his wife. The rest of the cast are somewhat wooden (Clooney, Silverstone) or irritating (O'Donnel, Thurman - she can really do better than play a sexually frustrated plant-woman), but their flaws don't warrant mud-slinging. The effects are astounding if repetitive and ostentatious, and don't fail to impress even by today's standards. In a nutshell, this movie could have been so much better, but still can be taken at face value. In no way a masterpiece like Batman Begins or Batman Returns, Batman and Robin is a decent superhero flick down on its luck."

Even George Clooney said he regretted playing Batman. But I think the movie, overall was OK - at least I sat through the entire screening, did not fall asleep and did not regret spending money on the ticket.

I've seen some movies that I utterly dislike. Example - DreamCatch"
3302,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Batman and Robin is one of my favorite films. The effects are just great. The plot is not dark and scary. As a kid I did not notice the puns through the film.

The public and media just love to jump on the ""Bandwagon"" - they can go suck it for all I care.

I also cannot understand why many of the cast actors regret it, and how many use this as an excuse to pore hate on Chris O'Donnell - a down-to-earth family person, something which not everyone gets to earn.

If I ever meet Joel Schumacher and Chris O'Donnell in my lifetime, I would shake their hands very hard and tell them: ""WELL DONE!""

22 years after, I feel very sad that the second film originally planned was cancelled, and that history never made its path through there."

3304,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"The film does have nice costumes, and nice sets. Unfortunately that is about it. One major problem is some of the choices of actors.They were all wasted. George Clooney is quite a charming actor, but he is not my idea of Batman. Batman I don't think is supposed to be charming, he's supposed to be dark and brooding, and Clooney lacked that. What would Michael Keaten and Val Kilmer and even Christian Bale say when they see that Batman has turned charming? Chris O' Donnell looked uncomfortable, and in almost every movie where he is a hero, this includes the 1993 version of the Three Musketeers, he is rather lifeless. Uma Thurman does her best, but what they gave her to work with was ridiculous, and she just failed to deliver, while Alicia Silverstone was extremely annoying. The worst case was poor Arnold Schwarznegger. He was completely miscast as Mr Freeze, completely lacking the coldness and evilness that makes the character so memorable. Schwarznegger is a talented actor, but his skills are hidden beyond recognition in this movie, he just looked so uncomfortable and totally out of character. The direction from Joel Schummacher was disappointing as well, it lacked the artistic flair and the temperament that is needed to make a great film. This is further disadvantaged by a truly pathetic script that nobody in the cast could do anything with.(these actors deserved so much better)The special effects were okay, but very confused in terms of execution. In conclusion, not the worst movie, I have ever seen, but it is one of those films, where everything needed to make it memorable falls flat. 3/10 for effort. Bethany Cox"
3305,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Batman & Robin tried a little too hard to capture the campy energy of the 60s Batman TV-show while trying to maintain the seriousness and epic scale of the 90s Batman movies. The mix undoubtedly did not work, but for someone who liked the TV-show, like me, watching this film is a real blast, with its ridiculously over-the-top lines and camp-energy.

Though the film added little credibility to the Batman franchise I still have to admit that I simply loved George Clooney's and Arnold Scwartzenegger's character-portrayals.

In spite of this, I can not forgive shoddy film-making and obviously cheap scenes involving green goo, re-used footage, ridiculously big car-chases, bouncing ice-sickles and reversed film.

As a film, Batman & Robin is quite the mess, if a funny one."

3307,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"There is perhaps no film more misunderstood than Joel Schumacher's 1997 masterpiece `Batman and Robin.' But I am confident that over time, people will come to realize the epic grandeur of this fine piece of cinema.

Schumacher only hinted at his level of greatness in the previous `Batman Forever.' This time around, his direction and plotting are top-notch, and he draws unbeatable performances from the entire ensemble cast. George Clooney is easily the best actor to step into the Bat Suit yet - his Batman is deeper and more multi-dimensional than one can even imagine. Arnold Schwarzenegger gives a chilling face to evil as Mr. Freeze, and Uma Thurman is positively spellbinding as Poison Ivy. Even the smaller roles are unforgettable - Chris O'Donnell once again proves he's the best young Hollywood has to offer, and model Elle MacPherson steals every scene she's in.

And might I mention, Alicia Silverstone was coldly snubbed by the Academy for her heartfelt performance as Bat Girl. Who won that year? Probably some over-praised, overrated British actress. Why was Alicia's performance so shamefully overlooked? No other performance that year took a more profound and meaningful look at the beauty and fragility of the human condition.

Don't listen to the countless naysayers who fail to grasp the greatness of this fine work. It is surely a treat for viewers young and old. A+"
3308,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Okay, okay, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this film isn't the most compelling piece of Art in the film industry, but I actually really enjoyed it! Not as good as Batman Returns (my fave of the Bat series), but my 2nd favorite.

However, Joel Schumacher should stay away from the Batman films, and let original director Tim Burton take over. Burton's films were more dark, eerie and haunting, which is what the original 1939 comic was about.

ER's George Clooney is okay (and that's all he is) as the Caped Crusader, but is nowhere near as good as Michael Keaton (or Val Kilmer, for that matter!). Chris reprises his role as Dick Grayson/Robin, which is fine, but could do better; Mr. Freeze is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger - the bigger villain out to 'blanket Gotham City an endless winter'. Yet despite what Arnie said (that he assumes all his characters are the most memorable), I think Uma Thurman as Pamela/Poison Ivy steals the show as the vampy ultra-vixen out for revenge.

Alicia Silverstone is cast here as Batgirl, and while her scenes are pretty cool (especially when she first arrives to kick Ivy's butt), her character, probably should've just been a normal girl, until maybe the 5th movie - they're are too many villains and heroes in this, that it gets a bit confusing. Michael Gough (the only person to survive the 4 Batman films) as now-dying Alfred returns, and it's his neice that turns out to be Batgirl.

However, moans aside, I thought this movie was pretty cool, I've seen it many times, and still agree that as an action movie, as a Batman movie, this wickedly-cool. 6.8/10"
3309,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"This film has but one saving grace - that it was so bad it brought about a rethink toward the franchise and led to the subsequent filming of Batman Begins. George Clooney is by no means capable of taking on the complex character that is Bruce Wayne and is far more suited to gracing the pages of celebrity magazines, the costume and set design were atrocious and a gross departure from the comics and original vision of Batman. And look for the scene where Chris O'Donnell appears from the water and the footage is actually reversed to make him seem to submerge - editing at its worst!

3310,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"There are some things that you should NEVER do in ANY MOVIE that isn't made by someone with nothing to lose. BATMAN & ROBIN does more that a few of these things, and I really can't believe that this film (using it loosely) was even released.

One of the GOLDEN RULES of cinema is NEVER alienate your fanbase. I don't consider myself to be a die-hard Batman fan, but like millions of other people around the world I have some general knowledge of the character and an interest in the comics that spawned him. BATMAN & ROBIN absolutely BUTCHERS everything that Batman was before, and leaves virtually nothing to take its place. I mean if the horrible acting, dialogue, and absolutely no plot weren't bad enough, they go and throw in BANE who is from a completely different era of comics, and change his character from a fearsome and powerful ex-con (who cripples Batman in the comics) into the missing stooge, or maybe the bizarro world version of arnold? (just a guess). And they put NIPPLES on the Batsuit, make a reference to the 60's series (which was campy as hell but still way better than this mess), and give Mr. Freeze great one-liners like, ""everybody chill!"". A developmentally challenged chimp could have written and directed a better film."
3311,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"This movie is so bad it's good. Absolutely iconic. I never want it to end. Im sure I could quote every line, all the actors are some of my favorites from the era. Gosh what a time to have been alive I was definitely born a decade too la"
3312,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Many people would beat down those who would give Batman and Robin a 7 out of 10 stars. However, the latter proves to be worthy of an average score in this viewer's opinion. In this day and age, it is difficult to find critics who have room in their hearts for goofy movie fun, that is if the film has some form of redeeming factor.

There is no denying that Batman and Robin is technically one of the worst movies ever made. From it's ice/plant puns, innuendos, bat suit nipples and buttocks, constant grappling hook saves and George Clooney playing George Clooney dressed as Batman, it is something that feels like an attempted advertisement to sell action figures. The bright and colorful aspect of the film gives it that appearance. Though if people look at it through a more positive perspective, they'll find the film accomplished setting out what it wanted to be from the start. Now that is not to be confused as giving Joel Schumacher credit for putting together this film, turning it from Batman to Power Rangers.

The cast really can't be blamed entirely for the film's failing results. They were directed to acting the way they did after all and some of the performances were acceptable while others, one cannot say the same thing. Michael Keaton played the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman for the original 1989 film and Batman Returns decently until he was replaced by Val Kilmer for 1995's Batman Forever. Kilmer wasn't the most amazing Batman by any means, but he made an effort to as best he could since that film was about as campy as this one. As already mentioned, George Clooney was playing George Clooney through the whole film. Never once could an audience viewer who is a Batman fan could look at him and say ""This is the Batman of my imagination!"" Clooney goes around without showing even the slightest bit of emotion, the kind that the character of Bruce Wayne is supposed to be feeling constantly, especially when he is Batman. He spends most of the time looking after Robin making sure he doesn't get into trouble and while that's good, even then he does not demonstrate fear for his friend/brother.

To add on to that, Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze is the king of camp and ice jokes in the film. Mr. Freeze was never the Joker. He's not very complicated as a character to figure out. He was always a dark, vengeful and hateful man who wants nothing more than to revive his wife from her terminal disease at any cost. Not only does Arnold succeed at being himself as usual, but it's as if he intended to play a Joker/Two-Face knock off of Jack Nicholson and Tommy Lee Jones' performances. Additionally, Batgirl's presence in the film wasn't great either. Her character felt out of place from the start being introduced as the niece of Alfred, Wayne's butler. Her transformation into Batgilrl didn't feel legitimate as it did random and unconvincing.

On the other hand, Chris O'Donnell's performance was possibly the only performance in the film that felt legit. All throughout, Robin's motivations for doing the things that he does rebelling against Batman are believable. He clearly outshines Clooney's Batman whenever the duo are on screen together. In addition to Chris O'Donnell, Uma Thurman, as campy as she was, did surprisingly well with her role. She was a perfect choice to portray the villain Poison Ivy in this viewer's opinion, even looking great for the part. It is unfortunate that her performance was hindered as a result of being casted for the wrong film. Had she starred in a Batman film directed by Christopher Nolan, she could have excelled. The actor who played Alfred (may he rest in peace) provided the film some heart to heart moments with George Clooney's Bruce Wayne, which were some of the film's best.

In conclusion, that is the cast. If we all can just take the film for what it is, as basically a cartoon in live-action, we can find it isn't as bad as the critics say it is. Check out the following youtube address for more insight on what makes the film great https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXHskZCqhiI.

It is clear that the film was not meant to be Christopher Nolan's the Dark Knight trilogy. Had Tim Burton, who directed the first two Batman films with Michael Keaton, directed this film, it may have turned out differently. For what it is, it is entertaining. It's one of those cases where it is so bad it's good or so good it's bad. The point being that the film doesn't fail at being the action comedy it is. While it may be a matter of persona opinion, the film contains great humor. Mr. Freeze provides humor related to ice. The character of Bane, while butchered as a villain character, gives a few laughs as Poison Ivy's oafish muscle incapable of speech. The action in the film serves as continuation for the film's camp factor, at the same time quite well done. Beneath the film's campiness is a good message about family and trusting one another, something not many would appreciate but deserves to be recognized.

Finally, just because the critics say it's atrocious doesn't make it true. For Batman and Robin, this viewer does not agree that it is the worst thing to ever happen in film. Maybe for Batman but people tend to take movies way out of hand forgetting it's all fiction and not reality. Batman Forever felt like more of a fail than this film for the way it handled it's two villains who turned out obnoxious. The villains felt amusing for this film but people can always agree to disagree on anything. Credit where credit's due for the film creating inspiration to take the superhero movie genre to a whole better level that has continued to progress today."
3313,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Everyone is being rather harsh on this movie, so let us break it down and have a look into why it isn't actually that bad. Firstly you have to look at the fact that this is a kids movie, it is not a movie for adults. A lot of fans are looking at this movie with the idea that the main character should be a certain way. Personally I find that quite pathetic. The intended audience is very clearly children, so why would the film contain strong adult themes like Batman normally does. When I was a kid I remember absolutely loving this movie because it was less serious. Don't get me wrong the darker versions are far more entertaining, however that's only because I'm grown up now, therefore I have no interest in the sillier side of superheros any more. my point is that we shouldn't say it's a bad movie simply because it isn't aimed at our demographic. jk it's "
3314,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"This is the only Batman who came around late enough for me to go see it in theaters. Afterwards, my company cursed me straight to the inferno for having them dragged to such a brainless kid's movie. Even at the time, i couldn't blame them entirely.

The Batman series had passed the revue in chronological order so i was well aware of the profound cleavage between the first two installments and the rest of the quadrilogy. The first two Batman movies marked themselves by a dark atmosphere and the importance of the Batman/Wayne duality , which, through themes as vengeance and love, provided much of the human element. From there the screenwriters and set designers injected an incredible amount of cheese instead. The villains became even more colourful, while the superhero himself lightened up his appearance with an arsenal of groovy tools and by putting nipples on his rubber suit.

All of this reached its climax in ""Batman and Robin"", which pretty much explains why the greater part of humanity condemns it. The X-ray eyes of the B movie addict, however, can see the good within the bad, so here goes.

the GOOD

Although they defy every first principle of architecture, gravity and related laws of nature, the decors of Gotham City are a visual feast. I have a weakness for antique sculpture so giant Greek studs rising in between the skyscrapers as the background for a car chase were a treat (**). The best things about this movie relate jointly to the actors rather than their characters. Clooney is indeed the best actor in the series to portray the philanthropic Bruce Wayne ( but Micheael Keaton remains the baddest Batman on the block) & lovely Uma Thurman just can't do anything wrong as long as she gets an attitude to toy with (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill).

The award, however, goes to Michael Gough, whose Alfred gets his greatest role here, compatible with Desmond Llewelyn's Q in ""Licence to Kill"". We all knew they'd change the focus to a secondary character eventually, but the shift is perfectly integrated into the story, not in the least by the arrival of Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl.(nice close-up on her rubber butt, by the way)

the BAD

Almost everything else. The action is everything but captivating. This actually goes for the consistency and pace of the movie as a whole. Surely it follows the routine of creating, deploying and defeating villains but still the whole process is no more than a string of scenes, with occasional sparks of entertainment. Did i mention the suits look ludicrous ?

The whole concept behind reflecting the skies of the opposite hemisphere through the use of satellites can impossibly make sense: to make matters worse, the defrosting of Gotham ... it just won't happen. Using solar rays would a) take more than five seconds to melt the amount of use surrounding a skyscraper b) it'd either cause a giant flood or clouds of steam, both lethal to the little frozen people in the streets. But given that this movie takes it very loose with the concept of freezing and states of aggregation, leave it be.

A word on the villains. The idea behind Freeze is as old as cinema, namely the scientist who's turned into an evil overlord with a noble yet personal goal by some misfortune, usually involving loved ones. To take effect this type of villain requires not only a constant display of an uneasy balance between his thirst for revenge and his humanity, but also a loved one, a cause, that the spectator gives a damn about. Freeze lacks both. Especially his spouse leaves me indifferent as she has no more to work with than a doll and some home videos. Luckily it's STILL Schwarzenegger in a kind of role he'll never reprise, with a funny one-liner (no i'm not giving it away) As long as we have Arnold, we're happy. Poison Ivy would've been great had she preserved more emotion (read: paranoia) concerning Mother Earth after her transformation, but her destructive side is too dominant, except at her very last scene. The seductive element isn't as effective as it could've been with Thurman, either.

the UGLY

The most obvious source of your general amazement was the observatory. The inside can host approximately hundred people and a giant space telescope weighing an equal amount of tons, minimum. Yet the whole building is shaped as a bowl in the hands of an knelled Atlas-like statue. I kept asking myself ""hmm...how are you supposed to get up there ? A connection inside the statue would take a long walk."". Furthermore the list could be endless, as distinguishing the Bad from the Ugly is hard in this movie. Freeze's suit, Freeze's minions, Freeze's transportation fridge, the doctor who transforms Bane and Ivy, the festivities at the diamond auction, the dialog between Batgirl-to-be & a holograph of Alfred (note: he sure knew her measurements when he made her a suit that ""fits her size"") ...

**a special mentioning of the scale on which Gotham is build. The comparison between a human, an observatory, a statue and the surrounding building leads to the inevitable conclusion that the city reaches heights of almost a mile. Fritz Lang might like it, as there is an unmistakable echo of ""Metropolis"" in this urban fantasy.

In conclusion: don't ask yourself to many questions, focus on what works and you'll make it through the Galaxy of ""Batman & Robin"". . How many times do i have to keep saying that anyway ? In the case of Batman, i'm sadly not in the position yet to write a more in-depth retrospective comment on the series as a whole. From where i stand, ""Batman begins"" goes back to the grim roots. To be continued."
3315,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"And you know what? It still works. George Clooney steps into the batsuit, replacing the troubled Val Kilmer, and makes the role his own. In my opinion Clooney is by far the best of the Batmen. Chris O'Donnell is back as Batman's trusty sidekick Robin, and the beautiful Alicia Silverstone enters the mix as Batgirl. Once again the caped crusader is called upon to stop evil villains from taking over Gotham City. When are these bad guys (and bad women) going to learn that you can't beat the Bat? Is it some sort of ego trip? Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze, and Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy, are the villains-du-jour this time out. Mr. Freeze was a scientist trying to find a cure for MacGregor's disease, the disease that took the life of his wife. Sadly, he fell into some stuff that turned his blood cold and really pissed him off. Poison Ivy, the botanist with a kiss of death just wants to let plant life take over the earth. Two different people, with one goal, to rule the planet, and get rid of Batman and Robin.

Without a doubt this movie does what it set out to do, entertain you. It has the same brooding atmosphere as the previous three. A gothic look that makes you wonder why people live there at all. Good guys vs. Bad guys in a battle for the planet. All the usual Batman melodrama, but the one thing that holds this film together is the true family feeling you get from watching Clooney, O'Donnell, Silverstone, and Michael Gough as Alfred. This movie is more about friendship, trust, and family. Before I saw Batman and Robin, I wondered if maybe having another actor play Batman, coupled with Robin from the beginning, and then throwing in Batgirl, would bring down the power of Batman, but it does the opposite. It does what really good movies do, it makes you want more. Instead of just comic book action, there is a feeling of a real family, fighting together as one, and that's what makes this Batman stand out from the rest. People you can feel for, not just root for. Watch out evil doers of the world, Batman and Robin (and Batgirl) are flying high, ready to take a bite out of crime.

By the way, when watching this great flick, please note the opening scene. The heros and villians are ""supposed"" to be skating on ice with iceskates. There are many cut-shots where the viewer can clearly make out 4 wheels on their feet as opposed to blades. Too funny to not mention."
3316,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"This movie is great, i don't understand why people bash it so much. You have to like it for what it is and its a Batman movie, a FICTION movie. There is no way you pretend to take seriously some guy who dresses as a bat and fights villains with ice powers like Mr. Freeze or with plant-like powers like Poison Ivy. What did you expect? see it as a live action cartoon. If you want a more serious approach go see The Godfather or something like that because there is no way you can fit all these fantastic characters in a realistic plot, even Nolan attempted it and failed though most people praise his work in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight i think it tries to be so serious so much that ends up being pretentious and ridiculous. Batman and Robin doesn't pretend to be serious or realistic but to provide you with an enjoyable story and nice visuals and does the job very well.

I didn't like Batman Forever that much, specially because Joel S. destroyed all the darkness from the previous 2 films and the atmosphere Burton gave them, but in this film, despite being flashy and campy like its predecessor its not as ridiculous and has a good plot, nice characters, good action and its highly entertaining. If you liked the 1966 series you don't have reason to dislike this because its pretty much a modern version of that show.

Im very disappointed we didn't get to see a sequel to this. I would have loved seeing the bat-trio in a new adventure against any of the villains that were yet to appear such as Scarecrow or even a comeback by Catwoman or the Riddler."
3317,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Swedish television star Arnold Schwarzenhoffen is very decent as the Man Of Ice, the best villain, indeed.

George Lazenby is very nice as the Man Of Steel also. He is my favourite Batman ever.

This movie is the most realistic of the series. I am liking the way the ice man is squirting his weapon over everyone. Very amusing. N plus ice = nice.

He is squirting it at Batman And Robert. They must escape. Tension! N plus ice = nice.

Joel Burton is a very nice director and his vision is an impressive one.

Uma Thermal is very nice as Poison Dwarf and so is Alicia Silverback as the Boy Wonder's girlfriend, Catgirl. Much sexings indeed. N plus ice = sexings.

Anyway, Man Of Ice is escaping his mental home and begins squirting the people of Metropolis with his ice gun. Batman and Roger must fight the Man Of Ice very urgently. I am liking this! N plus ice = nice.

Also, lots of plants are threatening to eat the citizens and a gang of underground maniacs join forces with Poison Dwarf to encourage the plants. Spooky. Nice! This is the best incarnation for Batman and is a vast improvement over Tim Schumachers original with Jack Nickelsun. I am sorry, I am spelling wrong, Jack Nicksenson. I apologise for my spelling. I shall try to spell it one more time - Jack Nikksonen. Oh forget it.

I love Arnooold Schwarzenneger and he is the star of this great epic. I recommend it to all Batman fans to see.

When I say ""The Master Piece "", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact, the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say its name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw Batman & Robin. A friend of mine came to my house a few years back. He burst through the door and slammed the DVD onto my bed. I had heard of the movie, but I had heard that it was pretty awful. So, having the expectations to want to kill myself after it, I reluctantly watched it. When the final credits rolled and the sun glazed upon my bed sheets, both of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Louie and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"". This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so in movie history! How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the puns in this movie are flawless as well, and the loyalty to the early years of batman make it a ""must buy"" for any comic book fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theatre, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!"" There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my ""favorite of all time"", but they've all fallen far short of ""Batman & Robin"". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately. You're guaranteed to find it in the ""employee picks"" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should Kill all the employees there because there is something seriously wrong with them. If you have seen this movie, go see it again. If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in your bag so you never leave the cave without it. :o So, you want a 1-10 rating???

Joel Schumacher's infamous re-imagining of the iconic Batman may just be one of the most genius remakes yet. This movie on surface level is complete bunk, filled with horrid one liners, poorly written villains, and a Chris O'Donnell's confused character motivations.

3323,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I saw this film a couple of times when it played cinemas June 1997 and actually had the pleasure of meeting George Clooney when he came to Australia for the premiere at Planet Hollywood Melbourne ( now defunct restaurant). Batman 1, Burton's Batman will always be the best, except perhaps for Begins ! However, compared to Forever, this is a much better film. Yes its campy in bits ( thats Schumacher's gay influence), yes most of Arh-nuld's lines are one liners and get annoying, however the action was good, the colours vibrant, and there is actually numerous witty lines throughout the film, and some strong acting by Clooney, O'Donnell , hingle and support.

This is Definitely not the worst movie ever, and should not be in the bottom 100. There are plenty of worse films for that. ( Amityville remake was a disappointment, as was xXx 2, Tomb Raider 1, AvP and more , but i cant be bothered thinking... you get my point.

I would really rate this about a 7.5/10, however, due to the ridiculous low scores of others, i have over rated to make up for it..

My kids will love it in years to come, as a 19 year old when i saw it in 1997 i had fun, and saw myself as a kid again... Big sets, big colours, big musical score and action set pieces, its definitely worthy of a look if you haven't seen it...

PS> the reason i think Schumacher & the studio went lighter & humour for B& R was because Forever was so successful and was already heading down the campy/fun path, so when its popular, they followed the trend, obviously too much..

Bear in mind I'm a big fan of the 60s TV series, and this is the only film that recaptures that atmosphere. (Of course nothing can beat the 40s chapter serials, but it's a bit unfair to compare them to any of the feature films.)

Don't take the movie too seriously and you'll enjoy"
3327,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"BATMAN & ROBIN has a reputation of being one of the worst movies ever made. It's currently #68 in the Bottom 100, it has a score of 3,5 and for many this is the movie that killed comic book movies for a while (along with STEEL starring Shaquille O'Neal that came out in the same period). After I saw a while ago I could understand why everyone hates this movie and many of the rumours are right, but strangely enough, despite being a horrible movie it managed to earn about the cost... making it one of the highest grossing movies of the year. Unfortunately the Batman franchise was killed and it was only revived in 2005 with BATMAN BEGINS with Christian Bale.

When the movie begins, it can be seen clearly why this movie bombed. It looks more cartoony and brightly colored compared to 1989's BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS. It looked like the director only saw the old and campy 1960s TV show and put it in a modern contest. And I can only imagine audiences in theaters enraged with the sight of a beloved franchise dumbed down in a cartoonish version. And at times there are even the sound effects from the old TV show.

The acting is atrocious by everyone. George Clooney, despite being a good actor, is too good looking and charming for the role of the Dark Knight. Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy overacted terribly through most of the movie, despite being also very seductive. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze comes off as the most laughable member of the cast, giving terrible ice-related puns every few seconds. But the worst performers in the cast are Chris O'Donnell as Robin and Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl. O'Donnell is whiny to the point of annoying and is so grating on the nerves, while Silverstone is very bland and emotionless throughout the movie (and it's no wonder that this movie killed both their careers).

If Joel Schumacher wanted to make a good movie he should have learned lots of things from 1989's BATMAN. It should have been darker, with only one good villain instead of three lousy ones and with more effective acting. Instead it looks like it was filmed in a carnival house, with lots of colourful sets and funfair-like objects (especially in Mr. Freeze's HQ).

Overall, a truly wretched and dull movie. It manages to earn a 3, but only because of the sets and also because if given a better director and a better script, it could have been better."
3328,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Batman & Robin unfairly gets trashed. I think people become purists and demand that the Batman story needs to be dark. I think adding diversity to the franchise isn't a bad thing. It gives choice to experience a different type of Batman.

A less dark Batman story was actually done before. The 60s show was pretty goofy. Honestly if you think about it then why not? Batman is a comic after all. This movie is so over-the-top and goofy that you got to know it's aimed at a young crowd. And they love these silly stories. The sillier the better. I avoided Batman & Robin when I was a kid because people said it was bad but honestly seeing it now I think I would have loved it. To me how you like this movie depends on your expectati"
3329,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"An American action film; A story about Batman, a caped crusader, and his sidekick Robin, who take on the villainous Mr Freeze who plans to destroy Gotham City with an icy doomsday weapon unless his demands are met. They also contend with femme fatale Poison Ivy, who is determined to cause trouble between the dynamic duo crimefighters. This superhero film came in for a bit of a hammering in recent years from some film critics writing retrospectives and compiling lists of 'worst movies ever made'. This one topped one of those lists. I saw it on its theatrical release and came out thinking it was gaudy and meretricious. With the passage of time I find myself assuming the role of witness for the defence because it is in fact better than many films lauded by critics since which rely on overuse of CGI and toe-curling dialogue. Clooney was well cast as Batman from the outset, delivering on the promise of some well-timed jokes and looking the part of a billionaire playboy philanthropist. Unfortunately, he never seemed to get his teeth into the role. Vibrant Chris O'Donnell, as the vigilante Robin with a partnership problem, fits his part well. Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy potently steals the show with her sly menace and staggering voluptuousness, entering the spirit of pantomime wonderfully. Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers another character seemingly written for his angular delivery, packed full of comic tropes on the words ice and cold. In recent years there has been a tendency for fans of the comic book characters to look for provenance and accuracy to what were two dimensional characters in comics. Director Joel Schumacher treats the subject matter honestly and employs pure kitsch fantasy, harking back to the stylisation of the mid-60s TV series. The budget is mostly up there on the screen in a frenzy of garishness, vibrant colour, action, and bizarre stage sets. Most of the action is in the form of real stunts. If one enters the spirit of old fashioned British stage pantomime, of baddies being bad baddies with twinkles in their eyes, it is perhaps not the worst couple of hours you've wasted."

3340,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Of the Burton/Schumacher movies ..

Batman, Batman Returns, Batman Forever, Batman and Robin

this is the best of the four. You heard me: the best. It's not a perfect movie, by any means, but it has some really wonderful moments that I'll get to in a minute. I think that those who disliked this movie so intensely went into it expecting something else. For what it was, it was fine enough ..

Surprises in this movie:

Arnold Schwarzenegger can act.

Elle Macpherson can act.

Alicia Silverstone can really act

Michael Gough can really, really act.

His Alfred Pennyworth steals this movie out from under the bigger-named stars and super-heroic derring-do.

Vendela Kirsebom Thomessen looks good, even pickled in brine. Two Sports Illustrated swimsuit models in one movie not about Sports Illustrated or swimsuits has to be a first ..

The movie's best moment is the introduction of Poison Ivy ..as an instrumental version of the Coasters' hit played in the background! Now, *that's entertainment*! Ivy was the only character that didn't work for me. I loved her as the femme fatale who charmed her admirers with the pheromone dust, but she was a bit too psychotic. Nice stems, though. And buds.

Schwarzenegger was fine as Freeze: too small, maybe, but he caught the sense of the character as I saw him just fine. When I looked, I saw Mr. Freeze, not Ah-nuld playing at being Mr. Freeze.

This movie reminded me of Superman I in a lot of ways. The super-heroic derring-do and the super-villainous nefarious schemes were played to the hilt as cartoon-ish as possible. Outlandish, bizarre, too warped to be believed: freezing an entire city with an overgrown ray-gun .. Come on!

But, where this movie redeems itself is in its moments at Wayne manor. Those were touching, warm, funny and very moving. I bought into the relationships of Bruce to Alfred, Bruce to Dick, and Barbara to Alfred. They seemed like real people.. a strange thing to say about a Batman movie to be sure .. that I cared about. Bruce calling Julie ""Ivy"" at one point was a nice touch.

Director Schumacher has been caught up in the fan angst over this movie, because I've heard elsewhere that he has badmouthed his own movie. I don't share his feeling, or that of the rest of the IMDb. I've been reading comic books for five decades, and seen all the iterations of Batman. This one wasn't bad. I have the DVD, and I'll watch it again."

3342,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"This is one of those bad movies that are plain bad and should only be watched to make fun of. The acting, direction, and f/x make it look as the cheap Batman series from the 60's but with a bigger budget. But the worst thing about this movie are the painful, non sense dialogs. Mr. Freeze delivers the worst lines in the Batman series I must add.

The situations are plain cartoonish and wouldn't even work for a video game. The demise of Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze is beyond bad. First of all, they were terrible villains. Arnold's performance is over the top and it hurts. Uma Thurman's performance is quite good and she's very sexy. Our heroes are just okay. Chris O'Donnell looked very uncomfortable as Robin but did what he could. Mr. Clooney seemed to enjoy the character because that way he could exploit his sex symbol image.

On the positive aspect, Alicia Silversonte is absolutely gorgeous. She's a delight to watch. But that's not enough to get this movie.

Director Joel Schumacher ruined the series that years later, Christopher Nolan resurrected with the brilliant ""Batman Begins""."

3345,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Staunch fundamentalist fanboys have declared 1997's ""Batman & Robin"" to be a blasphemous blemish in the superhero's chronicling, but it's easily the most entertaining of the four Batman films that came out between 1989-97.

Let's face it, all four of these flicks have the same cartoony tone. They were a couple rungs above the 60's TV series in campiness, but with better costumes and a super budget. And ""Batman & Robin"" was the most entertaining of the four. I'll admit that I'm not a big fan of the goofy/surreal style of these movies; I prefer Christopher's Nolan's raw realistic approach in the Dark Knight trilogy (""realistic"" to a point, that is). It's just that ""Batman & Robin"" is the most entertaining of the earlier series. Which is why I never got the whole ""Tim Burton's Batman is a masterpiece"" mindset. Really? Not to me. It LOOKED great, but the story was tedious.

Again, all four of these films have the same general cartoony tone and there's simply no validity to the position that Burton's ""Batman"" or ""Batman Returns"" are more serious/realistic in approach compared to Joel Schumacher's ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman & Robin."" I've seen 'em all back-to-back and they each have the same colorful we're-not-taking-this-too-serious style.

For anyone to enjoy these films you have to be willing to accept the comic booky world the filmmaker's have created. If you're willing to do that, these can be fun, half-serious Batman movies. You can't watch them expecting the tone of ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" or you'll be severely let down.

With this understanding, ""Batman & Robin"" is my favorite of the four. Here's why:

It has the best Batman/Bruce Wayne in George Clooney. Although Val Kilmer has the better Bruce Wayne demeanor (i.e. grimmer), Clooney just LOOKS like Wayne. In addition, he's charismatic and entertaining in the role from beginning to end.

It has the best sense of family between the inhabitants of Wayne Manor. The warmth and camaraderie of Bruce, Dick/Robin (Chris O'Donnell), Alfred and Barbara/Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) is a pleasure to behold.

It has Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl. Nuff said.

It has Uma Thurman shining in the role of Poison Ivy. I usually don't find tall, thin women appealing (I'm more attracted to females akin to Silverstone), but I have to admit that Uma completely owns the over-the-top role of Poison Ivy and is thoroughly alluring.

Arnold Schwarzenegger is great as Mr. Freeze. Yes, every time he merely opens his mouth you know it's Schwarzenegger, but he's amusing and he has a great look and costume.

The film has heart. Although Poison Ivy is truly ee-vil and gets her comeuppance, you can't help but sympathize with Freeze's love for his wife and desire to resurrect her. Batman is able to see under his icy veneer and see a warm heart that's willing to accept redemption and make restitution. Furthermore, as noted above, you really feel the love of Bruce and Alfred and the others at Wayne Manor.

Lastly, the film is full of vibrant colors and goofy over-the-top thrills. It's just a fun movie, if you're in the mood for a half-serious/half-campfest superhero flick.

I also like that Smashing Pumpkins song that plays over the end credits.

The film runs 2 hours, 5 minutes.

GRADE: B+"
3346,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Move over Grinch, we have The Schumacher Who Stole Batman...

After all the bad reviews from the previous film (Batman Forever), I figured that since Schumacher was allowed to do the next one (Batman and Robin), that it would surely be an improvement.

I didn't like BF too much, but it's a cinematic masterpiece given to us by the gods upon high compared to B&R. There just has to be room to give his film a negative number, since other horrible films that get ratings way below 5 aren't at this level, because there's no such thing as ""none more black"".

As I sat through the screening in 1997, I thought that maybe I had gotten old (I was 34) and just couldn't enjoy films of this nature anymore. After the screening I overheard some teenagers talking about how pathetic and awful it was - I felt like joining in! I have since seen quite a few comic-book movies (X-Men 1+2, Spider-Man 1+2, V-Vendetta, Batman Begins, Superman Returns, Hulk, Sin City) and I guess I don't feel too ancient anymore because these all range from good to excellent films!

3349,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Batman has long been seen as one of the greatest heroes of all time- Gothic, mysterious, cool, clever- then why, Joel, did you take that image and ruin it? Joel has never been one of my favourite directors, but even I did not believe he could sink so low. Joel Schumacher has taken the batman franchise and transformed it into a live action cartoon- Over the top performances, silly superpowers, and worst of all, the worst puns in history.

With these bad points, you may be wandering why I awarded the film 3 rather than 1 out of 10. This is because it does have a few good points- namely, some of the best special effects ever(for the time, anyway) and also features some great and authentic costumes and locations.

But thats where any good points end. The rest of the film, for the over-10 year old's watching it, is simply a humiliation to sit through. Featuring some of the most over the top, hammed up performances ever, none of the villains fail to convince the audience of their evilness. After all, how can a villain terrify when Mr. Freeze says 'Chill!' and 'Cool party!'? The villains cause more laughs than anything else in the film, and are the biggest insult to batman fans everywhere.

Even the heroes are awful- with the clean cut, smooth ladies man George Clooney playing the dark, haunted Bruce Wayne, Batman himself is ruined by a woefully bad miscasting.

So, all in all? If you want a movie to laugh at, then please watch this movie- it is quite simply hilarious in parts ('My condition has left me cold to your pleas of mercy'). But, if you came to watch a batman film, and not a pun ridden mess, then avoid this like the plague."

3351,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Batman and Robin: A Manifesto

1. When I was a small child, I had nightmares about monsters under my bed, kidnappers, alien, etc. To tell you the truth, I wet my bed frequently until the age of six. After seeing Batman and Robin, the nightmares returned. So did the bed wetting.

2. The acting: What acting? In fact, it's worse than bad. The english language can't describe how bad it is. No language can. George Clooney turns the dark and brooding Batman into a happy crime fighter with spunk! I don't ever want to see a man in that much rubber smiling at me again.

3. The plot: It's bad. Every hollywood cliche is thrown in. To make you feel sympathy, they threaten Alfred's death. ""Oh no...the only likable character is dying..."" HE WAS TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE MOVIE! Save yourself Alfred. Kill yourself, and you'll go warp speed to eternal happiness. I'm sure God will forgive you for being in this ""film"".

4. The special effects: They're really bad. Gotham is now lit with neon pink and blue lights. EVERYTHING is in neon. Batman and Robin show a blatant disrespect for the laws of physics. I'm not talking about standard movie stunts i.e; riding a shockwave, jumping off a 100 foot cliff, living through huge explosions, etc., etc....They surf through the air, falling thousands of feet through the air, sometimes moving STRAIGHT UP. Batman falls, then moves upward, completely defying gravity.

5. The flaws: they're everywhere. At one point, Robin is being pulled underwater. The shot goes like this: Robin is floating in the water-the villain pulls him under the water briefly-he resurfaces. Simple, right? Well instead of ACTUALY SHOOTING THE SCENE, they simply reverse the film halfway through the shot, so it looks like he's coming out of the water, when in fact you're seeing him go UNDERWATER backwards. ALSO, Alfred (just off his deathbed) whips up a batsuit for Alicia Silverstone in a matter of minutes.

6. The rubber: Alicia Silverstone doesn't have nipples on her batsuit, but Batman and Robin DO. THere are butt-shots and crotch-shots GALORE! What is wrong with Joel Schumacher? I think we all know...

7. In one scene, Mr. Freeze wants to freeze Gotham, so he goes to the city observatory, and plants little plastic icicles all over the telescope. Then he goes to the top, and it's magically transformed to some kind of freeze-ray. Does this make sense to you? THis sounds like it was written by a tow year old. It makes about as much sense as the scene in ""Kindergarten Cop: where the little boy puts his ""lazers"" (actually balls of tinfoil) all over a power line near his house.

8. There are too many characters. There's Batman, Robin, Batgirl, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, and Bane. That's six characters with twelve personalities. This film gives new meaning to the word ""filth"".

9. It's a testament to the stupidity of the american viewing audience that movies like this rake in millioms of dollars, while great movies like ""The Spanish Prisoner"" and ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" wallow in relative obscurity.

10. There is no plot, character development, intelligence, or thoughtfulness behind this movie. No story, no uniqueness, no artistic touches. There aren't any clever camera techniques or special effects. Just a bunch of ever-larger explosions.

11. This movie has nothing good in it, so they try to fill the gaping hole with loud special effects, more characters, and more one-liners.

12. This film insults your intelligence.

13. It's too stupid for adults, and too empty for kids.

14. The horrible truth is, there are some people who like this movie. These are the kind of people who watch WWF wrestling. These are the kind of people who will never experience the joy of reading a good book (Fahrenheit 451 for instance), or spend more than two seconds in deep thought. I feel sorry for these people.

15. The music: They didn't even bother to score new music for this movie, they just reused the music from the last Batman movie. The music is apallingly bad. Good movies have music that fits the scene, that enhances the movie, but doesn't overshadow it. It completes the movie. Films like ""Schindlers List"", ""The Truman Show"" and ""The Hunt For Red October"" all have music that perfectly fits the movie. This has recycled junk thrown in.

16. Joel Schumacher, this is a message for YOU: We (the viewing public) don't want to pay seven dollars to see garbage. WE want to see movies that make us think. When you leave a good movie, you can't stop thinking about it. When you leave this movie (this could happen as quickly as two minutes after the opening credits), all I think is ""I want my money back"". When I left this movie, my ears hurt. My brain hurt. When I left this movie, I left a part of my soul in the theater. It was stolen by the mind-blowingly bad crapfest that is ""Batman and Robin""."

Now, the last movie in the old Batman series of movies. And what do I think about it? The word that the dictionary would use is probably: DISGRACE!

This movie is so bad not even the director (Joel Schumacher) liked it. Everything is wrong, bad or worse.

The story, just kidding ya, there is no story. The plot, or bad excuse for one, is this: Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy teams up in order to shape Gotham after their vision. That doesn't make sense since Freeze want's to freeze down the city while Ivy want's it to be full of wild plants. Yes, the artic is well known for it's exotic plants. All acting is beyond horrible. Uma Thurmans Ivy is high on her own supply. Arnold is so wrong as Mr. Freeze. If you wan't to see a good Mr. Freeze go watch the Batman: The Animated Series episode Heart of Ice instead. The only reason he was cast was because Joel thought that Mr. Freeze should be like carved out from a glacier. That's the most corny thing I've ever heard. Batgirl and Robin are just pure crap and not done probably. This movie is a disgrace to Bob Kane, Frank Miller, Burton, The animated Series and everyone who ever loved Batman.

With Joel Schumacher in full control all hope of a long awaited respectable installment is lost in one swift, ridiculed and utterly appalling excuse for a Batman movie.

Disappointment is present within every aspect of the films shameful creation, as the narrative surpasses the foolishness of the previous two productions, as it is evident that Schumacher had learned nothing from the disturbing lack of seriousness in ""Batman Forever"". In this installment Batman and Robin face a trio of adversaries, as with Mr Freeze hellbent on putting Gotham City on ice in attempt to cure his wife, Poison Ivy intervenes with her own agendas with the assistance of a reckless super solder otherwise known as Bane. The plot is severely flawed, as the idea of a temperature restricted super villain attempting to transform Gotham into a work of the arctic is simply ludicrous. What is even more frustrating is the lack of development or reasonable origins for the three villains, as they are all unsubstantial and quite frankly inexcusable. Furthermore the absurd style in which the plot is delivered for the matter results in viewers caring little for the damned city of Gotham regardless of how far Mr Freeze progresses with his villainous plans. Besides the main plot, aspects of the sub-plot bring forward several undeveloped issues to the viewer all of which lack consistency in terms of the focus upon them, as all of these disappointing factors result in a plot unworthy of any recognition due to its disregard for seriousness and inability to fully develop characters and minor aspects of the plot.

Visuals remain a key issue from the previous installment, as Joel Schumacher's personal touch to various elements of the films visuals in particular only serve to worsen the production further. With the artificially luminous colour pallet still in use it tends to negatively coincide with the poorly designed and endless ice based props all courtesy of Mr Freeze's reign of ludicrous terror. The most stupid of all however is the inclusion of not only Bat bums, but nipples, skates, surfing and a bank card designed specifically for the Caped Crusader, as these pointless props add to the ridiculous style and the excessive number of goofs.

Standing as the 3rd Batman in just 4 films the lack of consistency in the casting of Batman evidently leads to the shambles of a performance that George Clooney forces upon a now disappointed fan base. Clooney simple exceeds the disappointment of any past cast caped crusader, as he obtains no heroic qualities leading to an unauthentic performance due to his lack of belonging in the production. With Chris O'Donnell's unfortunate return as Robin, the reckless, young and inferior sidekick has become an even more unlikable character as his arrogance allows him to be utterly disliked and irritable throughout. Furthermore the on screen chemistry between the two is abysmal at best. The pair simply squabble or fill the air with ludicrous solutions and shameful one liners that are undesired to say the least. The epitome of casting however is evidently seen in the reckless decision to include Batgirl, as this ridiculed hero sums up everything that is wrong with Batman and Robin. Alicia Silverstone portrays an arrogant and spoilt teenage girl who's arrival as Batgirl is not only unwelcoming, but disturbingly spontaneous.

Unsurprisingly many of the casting choices in terms of the villains are severely flawed, yet a successfully comical performance from Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze stands as the only pleasing performance. His performance is surprisingly enjoyable thanks to his trademark and significantly strong Austrian accent dominating lines from the literally puns personified iceman. Where there's room for one pun Schwarzenegger gives you two and regardless of how inappropriate they may seem you can't help but laugh and at least enjoy one aspect of this painfully awful production. Unfortunately in terms of the casting and presentation of the remaining 2 villains nothing could be more insulting to the films comic book origins. With a ridiculous costume design, Uma Thurman's performance is simply diabolical. With a tendency to irritably and spontaneously narrate in a form of poetic verse, her actions in the film are simply repetitive and unbearable which evidently accounts for the film's equally poor narrative. Considering his origins are that of a super soldier high expectations were certainly set for Bane who originally stood as a diverse villain, however such a poor representation of such a superior character disgraces the honoured work of Bob Kane. Bane is reduced to a giant, grumbling, slow and motionless character, a representation completely opposite to his first appearance in a Batman comic in 1993. If Bane is unable to break the Bat he can certainly contribute in breaking this formerly admired franchise.

It is evidently clear that since Schumacher's hijack of the Batman franchise upon his arrival on the scene of Batman Forever has ensured its utter deterioration. Surpassing the disappointment of previous installments, this horrific and disgraceful production is undeserving of any major credibility and is unlikely to be forgotten in the painfully reminiscent years to come."

3363,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"If Batman Forever was like a bad parody, Batman & Robin is a parody from hell. It seems as if they intentionally threw all credibility into the wind and TRIED to drive down the franchise. The plot is the weakest so far, and the villains leave much to be desired. The main character castings are again a case of highly reputable names, but with performances that are subpar compared to their usual level - and Clooney simply isn't Batman material in my books, and especially not with this ""performance"". As the only positive note of sorts I have to say I feel kinda sorry for Michael Gough, as he is the only one putting in a respectable performance with nothing bad to say about it.

What is also painstakingly evident is the horrid extras. The acting is just so bad and over the top that it rivals the worst B-class movies I've seen, and this apparently being an attempt at comedy/parody is simply no excuse for it. The guards, the crowd noises, the telescope event hostess... it's painful.

How Schumacher managed to go so low with his Batman interpretations is a real mystery to me. I'm glad I never had to pay to watch this (aside from TV permit). But even the time spent watching this (and spent making this comment) is more than this sad husk of a movie deserves."
3364,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"""Batman and Robin"" is the disaster of the century- nay, the millennium! This movie was terrible to say the least. The opening sequence began promisingly, as Mr. Freeze (Schwarzenegger) tries to steal a diamond, but Batman and Robin (Clooney and O'Donnell) interfere with his plans.

However, the movie goes downhill as soon as the scene shifts to South America. The introduction of Poison Ivy (Thurman) and Bane (Swenson) was poorly executed to say the least. (In fact, Bane seems to have been raised by monkeys or something. His communication is limited almost entirely to grunts or growls.) Having said that, Schwarzenegger's portrayal of Mr. Freeze is sacrilegious. He is now a man armed with a big gun, constantly speaking a never-ending river of puns involving ice or cold. And Clooney's Batman is TERRIBLE! For example, he tells Robin that Alfred is dying. And when the camera cuts to him, he has a ridiculous grin on his face!

However, there are two bright spots, as far as acting is concerned. The first is Michael Gough as Alfred, Bruce Wayne's ever faithful butler. As with every movie, he really makes the character his own. It was tragic to see him in such a disaster, but he tried his best. Second, I was quite surprised at Alicia Silverstone's acting. Sure, her character was completely ineffective and unnecessary, but she seemed to be the only one who CARED that the movie was a disaster. Ineffective as her character was, she still did a decent job. But not even their Heraclean efforts prevented the movie from being a disaster.

As to the plot itself, it is very poorly written. It has all the elements of a good superhero movie... NOT! The childish romantic triangle between Batman, Robin, and Poison Ivy is so terribly executed, you begin to wish Ivy'd just kiss them both and finish the movie.

In short, if anything happens to prevent you from seeing the movie; if your television breaks right before you press ""Play""; heck, if you're run over on your way to the video store, you have been saved by a miracle! The movie is awful, to only scratch the surface."
3365,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"George Clooney moves in as Batman, and is the least-lookalike of Bruce Wayne of the three Batmans, but also refreshes by talking more like a regular person, less monotone. He is a rugged Batman, but not overly dynamic, something we don't fully ever seem to get. Poison Ivy was a very good villainness, to me a bit better than Catwoman in Batman II -- maybe I'm spoiled by Julie Newmar, maybe I'm just a man. But I enjoyed the kiss and die, in which Uma Thurman's sexiness worked well, and the alluring botany theme. Something about botany, about flora, makes all of us more relaxed, one with nature? Comfort in a film. But this contrasts with Arnold Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze. Wooden and blah accent and rigid, the only more wooden thing being his puns (they are bad and poorly delivered). There is something new as always: Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone), giving us, interestingly, more heroes than villains. All in all, enough to keep the Batman series interesti"

You'd have to be mentally deficient to not understand that all the stuff you criticize it for is done on purpose. This movie is an obvious tribute to the old comic-books stories and to Adam West's Batman. Like the tv-series featuring Adam West, what makes it so fun is the fact that you never truly get if it is intentional comedy or not while you watch it. I mean, like I said you do get it if you have a functioning brain, but it's the kind of comedy that works because they don't throw a bunch of lame jokes at you (*coff-coff suicide squad coff coff*) but they keep it really subtle and you actually have to use your brain a little bit to really get all the absurd and nonsensical stuff that happens and laugh. I also loved the settings, the colour palette, the over-the-top villains and the pacing of the movie.

So if you don't have a sense of humour and like to watch hearthless, soul-less movies that feature a bunch of people talking in colourless settings and 3 minutes of actual superheroes doing stuff, go watch suicide squad, the amazing spiderman or batman v superman. If not, enjoy this masterpiece."
3371,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"This movie pits ""Batman"" (George Clooney) and ""Robin"" (Chris O'Donnell) against a new villain named ""Mr. Freeze"" (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his band of ice skating thugs who are out to wreck havoc on Gotham City in order to collect a huge bounty and destroy the dynamic duo in the process. To further complicate matters another super villain comes upon the scene by the name of ""Poison Ivy"" (Uma Thurman) who not only has a powerful henchman named ""Bane"" (Jeep Swenson) to do her bidding but also has an insane plan to eliminate all diesel fuels which threaten the fauna of the world-at the expense of all human life on the planet. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie started off okay but as it progressed-and more subplots were introduced-it went downhill fast. For example, although I happen to like Alicia Silverstone, I honestly didn't care for the addition of her character (""Batgirl"") at all. With everything else going on I thought it was simply too much. In short, while I don't consider this movie to be terribly bad necessarily, I must admit that it was rather disappointing overall and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average."
3372,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Stop blaming Schuacher! I am sick to death of everyone bashing Schumacher for his run on Batman and then saying that he's a bad director because of it. Schumacher had little to do with anything except yelling 'action', sure the art design was his but you'll notice that the art design in this movie is even more garish and over the top then the last one but that's because the studio was putting pressure on Schumacher to make it even more family friendly and safe then the last one, not only that but the toy company had a heavy involvement in the art design and concept art was apparently being ripped out of the artist hands so it could be sent to the factories in China. Rather then blame Schumacher I consider this movie a warning; Batman Returns was a parable on what happens when you give someone too much creative control but Batman and Robin is what happens when you have too much studio interference. This film is a mess, the production design has gone from so bright it irritates your eyes to so bright and garish that it distracts you from the film, none of the actors are taking this film seriously and so the acting is actually kinda funny (it does bring the 60s series to mind), the action is tame, the humour is bizarre, and the serious stuff they try doesn't work at all. This film is pure fluff, it's so odd that it's mesmerizing, I love every second of it, the bad puns, the garish production design, the bad acting, it all comes together to make on of the funniest films I have ever seen."

I didn't really enjoy George Clooney's performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne. I also kind of liked Alicia Silverstone in her role as Batgirl. I also thought it was a little sick when two prison guards in one bit where making Mr. Freeze suffer in a cell.

Although I kind of enjoyed it, I didn't feel the respect I had for the first two movies, which I thought were great Batman films.

There's not a lot that I can say for this movie, but I feel that if you want to watch a more decent Batman film, watch the newer ones or the two Tim Burton directed. You'll mostly be disappointed with this movie. My rating: 3 out of 10.

3376,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs

Gotham City is in the grip of a new enemy: Mr Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger). A former noble scientist thrown into despair when his wife starts dying, an accident in a science lab has turned him into a super-villain intent on turning the city into a massive block of ice. But he's about to find a new ally in the shape of the beautiful, sexy Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), also a former scientist killed after discovering a secret she wasn't supposed to. Her plan is simply to callously illiminate man-kind so her floral kindred can make the world theirs. Of course, the caped crusader and his side-kick must stop this, but as Robin struggles to mature to find the strength and restraint to be Batman's ally, can the two work together in time to make an effective partnership against evil...

Easily the most critically mauled movie of the Batman franchise, the final part in the old series is again directed by hack director Joel Schumacher and continues with the awful Forever's lighter, more family-friendly turn. And it's dogged by the same problems the last film had: the story is lame, the dialogue clunky and poorly delivered and basically having the feel of a loud, garish, overly-colourful nightmare production. But, in my personal opinion, I would say it is just a step away from being the worst movie of the franchise.

There is at least an engaging sub-plot to this one concerning Alfred, his deterioration into illness and the arrival of his grand-daughter (Alicia Silverstone), unlike the last one which was just a non-stop assault of loud, colourful, vacuous nothingness.

It's also helped (very mildly!) by some fairly good performances. George Clooney has a genuine presence as Batman (I'd pick him over Kilmer, that's for sure!) and Thurman has a genuinely sexy presence to her as Poison Ivy (appearing in some figure hugging sexy suits and pouts that certainly raise the temperature a degree for a PG movie!) as well as giving a good turn as a nasty, well-spoken bitch with a genuine contempt for humanity. As for Schwarzenegger, he looks cool (forgive the pun!) in his Mr Freeze costume, but he's really at his bad-acting worst in terms of his performance here. Chris O'Donnell is as hopeless as ever and thankfully faded into oblivion shortly after this movie was made. The same fate, it would appear though, fell to Silverstone, who didn't deserve it as much, but her role as Bat-Girl here is pretty pointless and a rather tacky marketing gimmick aimed at keeping the franchise going longer (which failed.)

Overall, I can kind of see where the detractors are coming from with all their criticisms of the movie. Like Schumacher's previous effort, it's a loud, colourful, pretty vacuous experience, just not as much so as the last one. You could at least see it on a 'so-bad-it's-good' value just to try and make your own mind up. **"
3377,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"My Rating: ** out of ****.

Batman and Robin is easily the worst of the Batman's. But one of the worst movies of all time? Thats kind of pushing it. Sure not a good movie but not quite bad. Nevertheless, this is a money-driven sequel that Hollywood is more than capable of giving us. The three Batman's combined would have made a solid trilogy but this Batman has sort of stained the Batman name.

The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was pretty good. My taste has matured and I can see whats wrong with it. It is simply an overdone movie. It overuses special effects to the point where they take over the story. The action sequences are not expertly done and it shows.

Batman and Robin is an overproduced movie but its real problem lies in the script. This script gives us some really stupid dialogue. But it also tries to build a complex character out of the villain, Mr. Freeze. However, it doesnt work in the movie. This is because Arnold Schwarzenegger has limited range as an actor. He wouldn't be able to portray a complex character.

The rest of the cast is disappointing. George Clooney is easily the worst Batman. Chris O'Donnell is flat as Robin. Alicia Silverstone is irritating as Batgirl. There really is no need for Elle Machpherson here, except to admire her beauty. Uma Thurman is the only one to do a credible job. She is effective in an over the top performance as Poison Ivy.

The best thing I can say anout Batman and Robin is that its not really boring. If it was well made it might have been an entertaining action film. But its so screwed up that its no better than mediocre."

I sat there wondering whether or not to try to drown myself in my $3.50 medium soda (which yes, everyone has made perfectly clear that 25 cents more would buy me the tub size).

I wanted to end the pain, the misery, but I was only 25 minutes into the worst torture of my life . . . watching George Clooney and Arnold Schwarzenegger trade off one liners.

Arnold was the worst: ""Everybody freeze"" ""Hey Batman, Chill out"" ""It doesn't work on the cold hearted"" ""Always winterize your pipes""

I'm sure glad he had a cold reference in every line because I was really unsure he was Mr. freeze and not one of the gladiators from Running Man (ya know, like Dynamo, the human Las Vegas Strip).

Clooney practically burst into fits of laughter upon saying Alfred (you know, the one who actually attempted to act) was dying. Too bad the audience was already dead at this point - the first real casualty of the movie.

The dialogue and action are not very serious, this movie does not take itself so serious, it's fun and a little cheesy, as if Schumacher had taken inspiration from 1960s Batman and Robin.

Indeed, Batman & Robin tries to make homage to 1960s era Batman live action series, and cartoon, while not undoing what Tim Burton had made in 1989's Batman. That's the best possible combination of both stiles of Batmen, the Burton's claustrophobia nightmare, and the colorful cheesiness of 1960s comic boo"

3386,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"BATMAN & ROBIN

Unanimously deemed the worst BATMAN film in the franchise, the fourth installment is crushed by the weight of Joel Schumacher obsession with glitz and superfluous sequins. BATMAN & ROBIN follows the Dark Knight as he embarks on a partnership with Robin. There partnership is tested as they take on the evil Mr. Freeze (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) and the seductress Poison Ivy (played by Uma Thurman). BATMAN & ROBIN has received more flack from critics and audiences then I would ever lay upon it, because to me the film is a good deal of fun to watch. It certainly could have used a dose of tranquilizer or something to calm down the manic camera-work and the over-the-top production design. However, at times BATMAN & ROBIN is a very entertaining movie... sometimes as a decent action movie and something as a ""so-bad-it's-good"" movie.

The thing with BATMAN & ROBIN is that it's drenched with the stink of Schumacher's awful direction. What audience did this man think was going to see this film as he filmed close ups on Batman's ass in the suit... or Robin's codpiece? Did he honestly think fans of Batman needed to see all the campy razzle-dazzle in a film about someone known as the ""Dark Knight""? And what was Schumacher thinking when he cast Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl? Watching this movie I feel bad for the girl as she looks like a deer-in-headlights at every turn.

But while half of the blame for this film's failure should be blamed on Schumacher... the other half should be blamed on the script-writer. If ever there was an unbalanced Batman screenplay this is it. The script creates villains that couldn't be played as anything other then camp. But meanwhile, it creates such a dramatic storyline regarding Batman's butler Alfred that requires the heroes to be played in a very serious manner. Unfortunately, as a result, George Clooney and Chris O'Donnell offer the most awkwardly inhabited performances of their very different careers.

Nonetheless, the saving grace of the film is Arnold and Uma. As Mr. Freeze, Arnold Schwarzenegger clearly has fun playing an incredibly exaggerated version of himself. There is nothing subtle about Mr. Freeze, from the costume, to his abilities, to dislodge like ""A storm is coming"" and much more. However, Schwarzenegger pulls it off with a genuine sense of fun. And Thurman as the seductive Poison Ivy has never been this fun before or since. Granted, Thurman has offered better performances in other films... but she has never succeeded at capturing such a sense of fun abandonment. Her Poison Ivy is incredibly one-note, but that one-note is the most captivating piece of entertainment in the film.

The villains are so much fun they make the entire movie watchable. But watchable does not equal satisfactory. It goes against all logic that the audience for a comic-book film would root for the villains, and yet that's how Schumacher's BATMAN & ROBIN plays. In a way, it's so easy to write a bad review for this film, and yet it's the kind of movie I can watch over and over. Because the film's faults are so blatant, it adds to the camp factor. However, watching BATMAN BEGINS, it becomes clear that any quality Batman movie should never be defined purely by ""campiness"".

3388,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I know all the freaky, pseudo-Goth, Tim Burton fan boys love to trounce on this movie, but it does have many good points to accompany the bad. Since the other reviews cover the bad adequately, I'll stick up for the good points:

For starters, George Clooney made the best ""Bruce Wayne"" out of anyone to play him. In the much exalted animated, Bruce is a rich, handsome celebrity attending many gala functions amongst Gotham's social elite, and so he is portrayed in this movie. Far better than the quirky, curly haired nerd that no one in Gotham recognizes in Batman 1 and Batman Returns. However, Val Kilmer looked far more intimidating in the Batsuit than either George or Michael Keaton.

The cinematography from B&R and Batman Forever trounces Burtons movies. Seeing Batman falling through the air with cape flowing looks cool, and is a Batman trademark. Either because of technology limitations, or Burton's lack of vision, all we see from Burton's movies is one scene of Batman hang-gliding. I love the enormousness of Gotham in the Schumachers movies. Contrary to Burton fans whining, GOTHAM CITY IS NOT ONE HUGE DARK GHETTO! No major city, such as NY or LA is. While it's okay for Batman to hang out in the ghetto to beat up tw0-bit thugs, I can't really see him doing battle with anyone in his rogues gallery there. Can you picture Poison Ivy, the Riddler or Mr. Freeze hanging out on dark alley like Skid Row???

Some scenes involving Bruce & Alfred, and Freeze & Nora are actually quite on the money, and have much more depth than anything seen in the other 3 movies.

The movie was not a box office bomb. It made more than GoldenEye. This obviously isn't the movie most batfans were looking for, but was meant to be more of a comedic, lighter toned interpretation of Batman. If you judge it by what it was trying to be, it's actually a pretty okay comic-adventure with some stunning visuals. However, this isn't the direction the production should have taken: It should have been a more well balanced action/drama/tradgedy/adventure with some clever humor here and there, like the animated series.

Still this movie is better than either of Burtons. They had just as little depth, a quirky unintimidating Batman, and none of the stunning visuals from the latter two Bat films."
3389,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I have always thought that George Clooney looked more like the comic book Bruce Wayne more than Adam West or Michael Keaton. Given the right script and the right direction,he could have played the Caped Crusader just as dark as Keaton,much more straight than West and a heck of a lot better than Kilmer !! If I was to lay the blame for this fiasco on anyone's feet, it would be straight at Uma Thurman. Whoever told her she was good-looking ? Whoever told her she could act ? Poison Ivy is supposed to be played regally,haughty and earth-conscious - not stupid,obnoxious and idioticly.She is a car crash as a would-be comic book come to life.The role could have gone to Emma Samms,Markie Post or even Roma Downey.Part of the blame may have to rest at Alicia Siverstone's feet.Her costume,much like everyone else's, is too over the top and should have looked a bit more aesthetic. She tries hard in the role which has been adjusted for the sake of the plot, but the role should have gone to Louise Robey from ""Friday the 13th,The Series."" Arnold S.,Michael Gough and Pat Hingle try their best,but are continued to be upstaged and thrown off by Uma's hammy high school-level acting........if you can call what she does acting.I give it 7 out of 10 for effort."

You really have to see it to understand just how awful it is as words can't describe this fantastically pathetic film. What in the world happened to Tim Burton's dark vision????? It was replaced by Ernest Goes to Gotham City!!! The plot is moronic, the one-liners must have been written by a 5-year old, and the action makes The Three Stooges look like Barishnikov. The acting is also beneath contempt, who in their right minds can ever believe again that Alicia Silverstone can act??? (Ok, did anyone actually believe it in the first place?) Right from the outset, the director does not pull any punches. He firmly establishes that this movie will be dumbed down to the lowest common denominator, that it will be the Mel Brooks of superhero movies. From the ridiculous stunts, poor camera work, terrible CGI, there is nothing good about this film! Even the Batmobile looked like a Tonka toy! It now has a disco ball for an engine!?!! And what got into Robin? He wants his own signal like the Bat signal??? HAHAHAHAHAHA! Who is ever going to say, ""Commissioner, the Robin signal!"" HAHAHAHA! Robin is such an incredible wimp, such a baby, I wish Mr. Freeze had frozen him permanently. And taken BatGirl with him! What a travesty. What was Clooney thinking? He must have known the movie was terrible... And the incredible groaners, one after the other, these lame puns throughout the movie, all of them were incredibly obvious with absolutely not a shred of wit. It was simply sad that a director could actually release a movie this poor. And what idiot green lighted 110 million for this tripe????? There were so many things wrong with this dismal effort, that I simply don't have enough room to list them all. All those terrible puns about things cold; cold heart, sending me to the cooler, hell freezes over (twice), the snowman, he's hibernating, the entire evil hockey team?????? etc... ARRRGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!..... Gotham city looked like a joke! It was incredibly poorly rendered. And the entire scene racing down some giant statue's hand in the middle of the city, about 100 stories up??? What was all of that about? Or the whole surfing down from outer space? What the f....??? And did the Freezemobile not look like a big hair dryer? There was NOTHING at all good with this movie!!! NOTHING! It stunk! It's a dog! It's pure and unadulterated CRAP! It makes Pluto Nash look like Gone with the Wind! 1/10 (why can't I choose negative numbers?) R."
3393,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Schumacher sold his sole to Satan when he inflicted this garish, neon-lit florescent pantomime on the world - as divorced from the source material and the spirit of the original film as anything could be, in fact the cartoon Batfink has more in common with the Batman comics than this noxious, overblown, infantile adventure into crude commercial interest. Broadly Batman & Robin is a remake of Schumacher's ever so marginally superior Batman Forever, a sequel which was fairly popular despite being the virtual clone of this reviled photochemical filth. So just why IS it so bloody dreadful? For a start it's astonishingly patronising to fans of the Dark Knight and fans of comic books in general. Akiva Goldman's screenplay, because I suppose we have to call it that, seems to assume that the audience will go and see absolutely anything provided its loud enough and bright enough. But as Tony Benn once remarked ""I don't believe in scapegoats"" so I'm afraid the people who are actually to blame are people like yourselves. You who went to see Forever 3 times, you who bought the video and the tie-in U2 single and yes you, the one who said it was all much more fun than the previous one. In fact everyone who partook in the process of making Forever the biggest box-office hit of 1995 was consciously and complicitly creating the commercial space in which this barely nourished and puerile spectacle would gestate. Schumacher said that it was the first film in which he's ever cared more about the money than the material, an hilarious assertion given that there isn't any material just cringe inducing puns, unbearable witless camp and a lot of white noise. In a rare case of life imitating art I knew a man who was actually a human cartoon, as witless, camp and overbearing as this movie and he rushed out to buy the box-set version on video, spending a fortune in the process. Proof that it isn't just owners and pets that sometimes resemble each other, it extends to people and bad movies too. Please, please please Warners, delete this. Do it tonight, you'll sleep better."
3394,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"This is if possible the worst rubbish I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad casting and bad directing. Shame on you.. The dark arena of our black knight has been transformed into a cartoon-esquire disco fantasy world very badly constructed. I was so disappointed... I hope the next thing can deliver the dark fear full anger that from all time was the driving force in Batman... George Clooney is awful as Batman. He is to much of a funny guy charming cream muffin to be a tormented soul driven by darkness and fighting for justice and so is Chris O' Donnel. A very bad screen couple indeed I'm afraid. Arnold Schwarzenegger was also a total miscast for the role as mister freeze, as there ain't much of a scientist over him and he speaks like a stupid Austrian bear.. terrible.. all in all a big waste of time which isn't worth of much discussio"
3395,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,Warning: Spoil
3396,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"I really enjoyed Batman & Robin. Having seen the prior 3, this one would rate number 2. Michael Keaton did an excellent job as Batman. He had the mysterious & serious side that Batman needs. Also, Jack Nicholson was an excellent villain. Batman Returns was good with Keaton, but was a little to ""gross"" for my taste. I don't care for Val Kilmer or Nicole Kidman, so I didn't care for Batman Forever. Chris O'Donnell was the best in that movie.

Now, for Batman & Robin: George Clooney was so much better than Kilmer in portraying what I ""remember"" of the original Batman (Adam West). He gave Batman the same mysterious & serious side, along with a more of a sense of humor (than Keaton) and a more human aspect (than Kilmer). The one-liners and his simple grin are excellent and seemingly a trait with Clooney. It allows him to suggest a lot more emotion than Keaton and Kilmer. Clooney also ""updated"" the character/movie since he was on the rise as an actor at the time. I would like to see him again as Batman.

Schwarzenegger & Thurman portrayed their characters well. They did a good job, but were not integral parts of the movie - meaning, they could have had any villains. Silverstone did herself well since Clueless. She showed us that she has more capabilities than a ""ditzy blond""."
3397,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"If like me, you felt that the first two Batman films were cramped by the relentless Gothicisms of Tim Burton's tedious style, you may find this fourth in the series a refreshing change. Burton has been ousted in favour of Joel Schumacher, a chronically underrated director who added a good deal of sophistication to such otherwise mundane vehicles such as The Client, 8mm and the mediocre Batman Forever.

Here he demonstrates his mastery of audience wish-fulfilment, piling on well-executed action sequences with wonderfully wacky visual compositions and some very touching moments which really add new dimensions to the franchise.

The introduction of a new character in Bat-girl is perfectly timed. Silverstone's understated performance of feminine grace and physical strength provide a much needed counterpoint to the machismo of Clooney and O'Donnell. Clooney may not be as strong a Batman as Val Kilmer was in Forever, but he does hold the screen for the most part, proving just why he is so popular among viewers of all ages; he can handle a quip better than most leading men you could name and generates a sizzling chemistry with supermodel Elle Macpherson, stunning in her first screen role.

Certainly this film is not without it's flaws. Schwarzenegger so relishes his occupation of the bad guy role that he threatens to detract from Clooney's heroism, whilst Uma Thurman looks far too attractive to convincingly suggest she could hurt anyone.

But babes and villains have never been the lynchpin of the Batman films; it is always the plot that is the star and it is here that B & R delivers with aplomb. From the opening which deftly pits the protagonist against killer ice hockey players (and neatly establishes the fractious relationship between the titular duo) to the sky-high finale, the overall feeling is of being taken on a roller coaster ride where you have no idea when it will stop and if you will escape with your life.

The generally negative critical reception was undoubtedly due to a certain prejudice on the part of those who felt that the film would not be able to escape from under the shadow of the poorly scripted Forever. This is a vehicle ripe for rediscovery on a VHS system as it may well be in years to come. Perhaps only then will audiences realise just what viewers of the mid nineties were taking for granted."

3399,Batman & Robin (1997),3.8,Joel Schumacher,"Batman & Robin is one of my all time favourite movies! George Clooney and Arnold Schwarzenegger deliver the performances of a lifetime! Okay, jokes aside, this movie is pretty laughable, Joel Schumacher directed a far more brighter and colourful Batman movie compared to the darker Tim Burton approach. When I was around 7, this used to be my favourite Batman movie! Not even gonna lie, then I got around to becoming a film-lover and realised how bad this movie really is! The only reason it gets an 8 is because Schwarzenegger actually makes the movie funny, George Clooney's suit is kind of nostalgic for me in all honesty and some of the camera angles are pretty dope, ngl. This is also the movie that brought us the Nolan Batman trilogy which is 2000 times better than this piece of... *masterpiece* (of) cleverness and absolute genius! A serious R.I.P to the man, the myth, the legend, Joel Schumacher, who should not be remembered for this.. ahem, *masterpiece*, but for his other brilliant work like Batman Forever (yeah, to be honest I kinda love that movie), A Time To Kill, Falling Down, 8mm, Phone Booth, Phantom of the Opera and many more. The guy didn't only direct this, don't take the 8-rating seriously, it's just because it's nostalgic and brought us three other movies that were a f*** ton better than this one!"
3400,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"I went into this expecting a bad movie, you could say I was hoping for the best but expecting the worst. I'm a fan of Jason Statham which made me want to see it despite my expectations, plus I work at a theatre and see movies for free which makes me less picky about the movies I watch.

Now I don't typically leave reviews for movies, but after seeing this I felt that I needed to warn people. Up until tonight, I'd never seen a movie directed/produced by this Uwe Boll guy and believe me, as I write this I wish that was still the case. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie and you realize it within the first ten minutes. The cast is brutal, Statham, Liota and Reynolds are all laughable as the main characters. The evil army of 'Krug' reminded me of the dudes in monkey suits in the early Planet of the Apes movies. During action scenes you see the same shot over and over again as if they only had one shot of 'bad guy hit by arrow'. Even the props were bad, Stathams sword looked like something you'd give a six year old on Halloween.

I don't even know if I can accurately put into words how bad this movie is. The best way to describe this pile is to piture you and your friends trying to remake 'lord of the rings' in your backyard, because what you ended up with would be of similar quality.

If you read this review, don't make the same mistake I did. Don't watch it to see if it is as bad as the guy on the IMDb said it was. This movie should only be shown to criminals in jail as further punishment for their crimes."
3401,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"OK, first off, all of the glowing, gushing reviews here were obviously (OBVIOUSLY) planted by someone doing PR for the film (which is shameful in and of itself). There is no way that anyone sane would think this movie was anything more than laughable tripe.

I saw it at a preview, and have to say that I was expecting much more. I didn't realize that Ewe Boll was directing, otherwise I would have skipped it altogether (he should never be allowed near a camera, ever). However, I like nearly every star, enjoy the genre and have been a big fan of the video games for years now, so I figured that this would be worth seeing (nothing will ever compare to LOTR, but it sounded promising).

So yeah, there's not much I can say that hasn't been said here already. Horrible dialog, two-dimensional characters, lousy cinematography, cheesy effects and a plot which is nearly impossible to care about makes this one worth skipping.

Seriously, don't pay to see this. It will only encourage them to give Ewe more projects."

3403,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"The movie is garbage. If you've seen ANY Uwe Boll flicks in the past, you know exactly what to expect. It's not that the actors are bad per say (most do what they can given the limitations of the terrible script) but the whole film just reeks of bad editing and worst direction. It's bad. Really bad. Almost bad enough to be considered a guilty pleasure just so you can writhe and cringe at how awful it is. Granted, it's not as bad as last year's Eragon, but don't expect anything close to what Lord of the Rings offered us in terms of epic fantasy adventure.

Oh, and those ten star reviews you keep reading? Uwe Boll has to be paying them. I can't imagine anyone out there (even on the internet) is THAT stupid to consider this a good movie."
3404,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"Don't really know how he gets great actors in his movies. Uwe Boll does it again, a cast of some of the best actors in one of the worst movies ever made. The story is bad, really really bad, the acting wasn't good either even with the presence of Burt Reynolds, Ron Perlman and ray Liotta.

I have sworn that I won't watch a Boll movie again, they've proved to be a waste of time and money even if it comes in the shape of a 1$ pirated DVD. Never buy,rent, download or even think of borrowing it from a friend. Its a waste, and a huge one too. And be advised never to watch a Boll movie again, its enough already.

EDIT: I've posted this a while back and I just wanted to add something.

If you're reading this and you happen to work at a store where you sell video games, please and I beg you memorize the name and face of Uwe Boll and if you see him crossing the street immediately shut your doors and windows and put that close sign.

Boy was I wrong. It must have been a slow week in Hollywood for them to sign on. I should have known when I hadn't seen any press or reviews for it that it was going to be a stinker. As we sat through the entire movie, we watched others leave and never come back, listened to the boys behind us comment on how bad it sucked, and I was wondering if there was a money back policy for bad movies. I could have done something better with that $16 and 2 1/2 hours of my life. Watch this only if you have nothing else to do."

3408,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"We went to this film intentionally (knowing its reputation) as a means of escaping a really busy and stressful Friday. We don't recommend the film to anyone with serious cinematic intentions, However, as kitsch this film almost succeeds. So, OK, we tried to come home and convince our ""knowing"" kids that ""In the name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"" was worth the Friday opener vote, but broke down laughing about five minutes into our rave when they just were not having any of it.

So let me add a few cogent notes. For 'entertainment' value, given what we were looking for after a long Friday, we were very satisfied, though we worried at times that our guffaws and groans, and open commentary, might have disturbed some of the other 30 or so people in the theater (but for their own laughing). King Burt Reynolds? Oh well. We have to admit that Ray Liotta's ""Goodfellas"" reprise as an evil mage was the most amazing thing we've seen since Jack Lemmon's service as Horatio in Branagh's ""Hamlet."" Of course, this mention of Uwe Boll's effort alongside Kenneth Branagh is totally appropriate, except that Branagh's ""Hamlet"" had little entertainment value of any kind. School is still out on which of these two can make the worst film of a decade.

If Matthew Lillard's over-the-top contributions to ""In the name o..."" (which is all of the title that fits on the ticket marquee at the theater) served well in a film with vine dangling amazons, synchronized ninja archers, prolonged out-of-focus long shots, granular irrational close-ups, and some of the most inane dialog in the history of film, one wondered in that case why Scooby Doo didn't put in a cameo in one of the dungeon or castle scenes.

Nonetheless, many of the second tier characters were convincing and well acted, amidst all the mish-mosh of incongruous effects and disaffects. So there were moments when one, though not entirely forgetting how bad this film was, felt sorry for many of those who found themselves in it. Or should they all have known better?

But laugh! Oh my, did we laugh, to the extent that it became uncomfortable laughing at a screen strewn with dead bodies and actors struggling for motivation. Oh, we could have seen high drama or thought-provoking art, but this way our Friday night was pure poetry...

the dungeon it was dark and dank the bodies in a pile and there atop the smelly heap was Ray Liotta's smile.

his polyester wizard suit bespoke a man with guile but then behind a squeaky line was Ray Liotta's smile

when Uwe Boll directs a film the casting's done with style that's why for evil, nothing's like sweet Ray Liotta's smile

and though we hoot and holler at such feckless goofy bile now laughing all the way to bank is Ray Liotta's smile"
3409,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"Okay, a crap script. Serious problem with that. But some good acting, beautiful sets, nicely shot, good special effects. If you want to see a fantasy movie, and you have seen all the good ones, this is worth a spin. Loads of action. Well choreographed. The trailer movies on the DVD imply you are an idiot man who likes to watch movies for the boobs and violence, which doesn't set the mood, I admit. But there is no exploitation of women in this movie, and some of the women even take up swords. So, okay, this isn't Shakespeare. If fact, prepare thyself for character arcs that are vapid and almost theme-less. It's basically a medieval/supernatural revenge tale. But if you're just looking for a no-brainer fix of non-dragon fantasy and action, especially on a weekend afternoon, you will enjoy this. Jason S. is excellen"
3410,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"I went to see this movie because I needed some time to kill, and at over 2 hours in length, this seemed like a decent candidate. Boy, I was wrong.

Like previous reviewers that have posted before me, I would say that this movie was ""choppy,"" in that you never are watching one scene/actor for more than 5 minutes at a time. The back and forth between all the characters makes you feel a bit overwhelmed at first, but after a while when you get to grasp the plot it just becomes annoying. It's like the Director is saying ""Okay, now we've got to show you what's going on with these characters right this second,"" even if what they're cutting to is inconsequential.

The acting itself is underwhelming, as is the script. The script calls for the cast to sound noble or poetic at times, but it just comes off as cheesy. The plot was a bit outlandish, but I cannot complain here as I knew it could be as this was a Fantasy. So you'd think that the special effects would redeem this as it's a big Action/Adventure/Fantasy type? Sorry, the monsters didn't look more than a pile of mud wearing mud colored armor, the battle scenes weren't anything special, and the magic special effects weren't anything we haven't seen before with a few twists.

Pros: Jason Statham finally shows that a Boomerang can be a deadly weapon. Much Better than Paul Hogan in Crocodile Dundee. Cons: ""Choppy,"" too long, bad acting, bad script, sub-par effects."
3411,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"First: Burt Reynolds is the king! :) Cool and cheesy like a Shatner marathon.

Secondly, there is enough eye candy for everyone.

I didn't think I'd find a hidden Oscar-worthy film, but I knew I might have a great time hootin' at bad lines of overwrought dialogue. I did, but I also found myself following a nice B movie story with various nits to argue with friends(Why the women are mostly wasted in their roles, another talky villain?, mostly dropped plots suddenly found, but only for fight scenes), but still? I'd recommend this for a weekend matinée or a dollar movie selection"
3412,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"Please do not waste your money on this movie at the theatre. Rent it if you must. Ray L. & Jason S. are the only good things in the movie. Jason is always good to watch in his fight scenes. Burt R. & Matthew L. are both big jokes. They should stick to comedy. Claire F. has ""one"" moving scene which I'm pretty sure she brought with her from her Harlequin Romance days. This strange mix of TV actors with A & B list movie actors just doesn't work. There were too many characters, too many plot lines. The fake backgrounds were too obvious and made you forget the beautiful scenery in other shots. The ripoffs of matrix scenes and Lord of the Rings make you laugh. Hopefully Jason S. will do a Transporter 3 soon"
3413,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"I really don't know how people can be so harsh. The movie is entertaining, and good fun for most of it. Nearly all of the actors in it are good, and well known. The CGI is very impressive and i was surprised. The fight scenes are good and fun to watch. I actually enjoyed it.

Things that let it down are: 1) Matthew Lillard is a joke - he really cant act, and makes you cringe when he speaks its so bad. 2) A terrible music score - people talk about how music can make a movie - imagine Jaws without the theme, and Halloween without the tense music!! Well the music is so bad in this film it spoils it. I wonder how well it would have done with Hans Zimmer or the late John Williams behind the music 3) Nothing particularly new in the story, very similar to parts of LOTR and Eragon

Overall i liked it, and people who gave it such bad scores must not be into this sort of genre, or are being too picky, as its an enjoyable movie to watch."

I like Statham as an actor, the man has amazing charisma as an action hero, so I decided to watch this despite what I had read about it. I was very pleasantly surprised.

The movie I saw was very entertaining fantasy story with a great cast, great scenic locations, engaging battles, outstanding costumes, that kept me thoroughly entertained for it's entire running time.

I would describe the acting as ""adequate"". Some of the characters seemed over the top and the worst by far was Ray Liotta (I've never been a great fan of his), but overall they got the job done.

I liked the magic in this movie. It seemed very ""physical"" and hands-on. The fight near the end with the floating swords was very nicely done, and all the magical effects seemed ""believable"" as far as magic goes.

The scenery and costumes were fantastic, it gave ""dark ages"" feel to it, dirty and gritty.

All in all, I really enjoyed this movie. I'd give it a 7, maybe an 8, but I'm giving it a little extra considering how pleasantly surprised I was due to all the negativity, ending up at a 9."

Thrilling and spectacular movie full of fantasy that introduces us a brave hero and appointed to juvenile public and full-blooded adventure aficionados. Sword-and-sorcery saga with stirring action , spectacular images and fantastic scenes including witchery ,witchcraft and necromancy . Set in the kingdom of Ehb, the tale tells a good man called Farmer (Jason Statham), who was adopted by a family . The man married a gorgeous woman and a son sets out to rescue his abducted wife named Solana (Claire Forlani) and revenge a death , two acts executed by the Krugs, a race of monster-warriors who are dominated by the wicked Gallian (Ray Liotta). When Farmer's wife and his son leave their hut to sell cabbage at the village of Stonebridge, Farmer's farm is attacked by strange creatures called Krugs. With the help of his neighbor Norrick (Ron Perlman) he travels to Stonebridge; however, the Krugs capture his wife. With the assistance of Norrick ( Ron Perlman )and Bastian (Will Sanderson)Farmer's brother-in-law, and a magician (John Rhys Davies) he tries to encounter and save his wife. Furthermore , they are helped by an intrepid Amazon woman (Kristanna Loken) . The Krugs are being submitted by the sorcerer Gallian with the collaboration of the King's nephew Fallow (Matthew Lillard) who intend to amass an army to overthrow King Konreid (Burt Reynolds), being supported by his commandant (Brian White). At the end takes place an impressive battle between wizards (Ray Liotta , John Rhys-Davies and his daughter played by Lelee Sobieski) and Farmer .

This exciting movie displays unstopped action, thrills ride, spectacular fighting, violence and is pretty entertaining , though mediocre .This is a tale of magic , imagination, blood and wizardly set in a mythical world from Middle Age full of barbarisms . It packs large amount of fights in ¨Lord of Rings¨ style , there's a huge body count, this one actually knocks off an immense several struggles in which the warriors are staked bloodily in the chest, beheaded or slashed . There's really savage decapitation, plenty of bodies ripped in scraps and half, including some of the most tears ever, that spill lots of blood . Most of monsters called Krugs and humans victims are relegated to being stabbed in the chest ,throat or neck. Breathtaking images , spectacular battles and duels and lots of amusement and entertainment . Made on a fairly big scale with spectacular set design and glimmer photography . Quite budget for a German/Canada/US co-production and lavishly produced by the same Uwe Boll. Magnificent special and visual effects as well as excellent make-up department. Bone-chilling and atmospheric musical score and colorful cinematography ; furthermore spectacular production design . The motion picture is regularly directed by Uwe Boll . All four of the films he has realized that were based upon video games, House of the Dead (2003), Alone in the Dark (2005), BloodRayne (2005) and BloodRayne II: Deliverance (2007) were listed on the bottom of barrel by the reviewers. Most of the other films he's directed, including Heart of America (2002), and Blackwoods (2002) are not widely available in America, but have received similarly low ratings among those who have seen them. Having directed 25 movies up to 2011, Boll is panned by the critics and he has received below average reviews. Recommended to those who amuse those kind of adventure films or those enjoy in general.The film will appeal to fantasy buffs with action enough to make it worth looking in on . In other words, it seem likely Sword-sorcery genre enthusiasts and juvenile viewers will be delighted because action and adventures are thrillingly presented and edited to offer the maximum impact. Rating : 5,5 ; average though some moments is amusing."

The actors do their job. Some with more enthusiasm than others, I grant you, but all in all the cast seems to have a good time and it shows. The sets are decent enough and the FX are certainly not abysmal.

This movie is OK i think. The bad guys and the good ones. Is true that the details are a little bad and is true that seems everything is too rushed but just don't think like the herd. I can find many errors in The Gladiator but that doesn't mean is BAD. If you like fantasy movies you should see this movie.

3426,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"Let me first say that I am a huge fan of Fantasy movies so would normally cut any film of this genre some slack. However, this movie is so terrible on so many levels that it doesn't even have hopes of making it as a ""bad"" cult classic. The script was poorly written, the acting (even by an all-star cast) was terrible and ran the gambit between lack-luster and over-acting. The dialog was boring and, depending on which character was speaking, ranged widely from having a stilted ""old-style"" tone to nearly modern - which was jarring. Also jarring were the horrible costumes and prosthetic monster make-up, both of which looked like they came from a local, cheap Halloween costume store...the special effects were slightly better and the backdrops/settings and set dressings were truly of good quality but this is about the only thing that can be said in favor of this film. The movie didn't know whether it wanted to be a comedy or a drama and mixed elements of both...poorly. There was virtually no character development and two of the main characters (played by Jason Stratham and Ray Liota) did not even feel like they fit in the time period/genre of the movie. Jason still had the look of a modern-day action star caught erroneously in a medieval setting and his martial skills were way, way under-used. In fact, the fight scenes in general were long, boring and poorly filmed. And Ray's modern-style haircut (complete with styling gel) was distracting and made him look as if he just stepped out of a salon - and his performance was so over the top as to make the main villain of the movie appear ridiculous and pathetic. Only three actors are worthy of mention as providing consistent and worthwhile performances: Brian J. White, Claire Forlani and John Rhys-Davies(in that order). Ron Perlman was also not bad....but unfortunately, none of them are the main focus of this film which just drags on and on and on..... Wow...what else can be said....the music was bad, ranging from melodramatic to Saturday-morning cartoonish - all of it noticeable and distracting. The editing was poor - some scenes were blurry or had a totally different color tone from other frames - again very noticeable. Some of the special FX were good but they too were few and far between. Lastly, the plot is entirely predictable with every cliché imaginable being used and nothing new or memorable to look forward to. As a lover of fantasy movies (and games) I felt compelled to sign-on and warn others about this movie. I am a fan of Conan, The Barbarian Brothers and many other ""B-Grade"" Fantasy movies...this one is an F-Grade!! It is not as good as Eregon (which is not saying much) and is nearly as bad as Dungeons and Dragons! Don't bother!"
3427,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"This movie isn't as bad as Space Mutiny; I'll give Uwe Boll that. I'd just have to say that its only downfall is that it really doesn't have anything to do with the game besides include similar characters and locations. Beside that, it's your basic mediocre fantasy movie. Not ""good,"" not the absolute worst, but in between somewhere.

The movie also tends to skip around plenty, but the plot was at least easy to follow as well amidst all the battles and dialog. It may be cheesy, and it may be clichéd, but at least it has some decent effects here and there and alright fight moves.

If you have to see this, and you played the Dungeon Siege game, go with a friend, as I did. It should make for a good laugh.

3428,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"This movie has Jason Statham drop-kicking orcs, has flaming orcs used as catapult ammunition, has Burt Reynolds in a ridiculous oversized helmet looking exactly like an imperial town guard from Morrowind (his King's Guard also consists of domino-wearing dual-wielding ninjas who always enter a scene with special fanfare), and many other goodies too: John Rhys-Davies playing Gandalf, Ray Liotta as a very campy villain with a funny accent, a whole gang of forest-dwelling... er... amazons??... with vine-commanding powers Tarzaning around the woods, and Ron Perlman too, leading a pig on a leash before kicking orc ass himself. C'mon people, give Uwe a chance. This movie is awesome.

We also get Claire Forlani as Statham's wife, Leelee Sobieski in plate armour, why not, a comic relief secondary villain who wants to be king, and Mike Dopud -- Stargate fans, for one, will know his name -- doing his best bearded impression of an Anglo-Saxon warrior. Oh, and let's not forget that Jason Statham, who is so very important in the final act, is never given any armour and fights in the thickest of mêlées in a cloth shirt. I guess the armour might hamper his ability to drop-kick orcs and run on their shoulders... or was that some other film?...

This movie is Uwe Boll's masterpiece. With a very high budget (especially compared to its atrocious sequels), it's Boll's ""Lord of the Rings"". Massive battles with actual actors, costumed orcs in fairly large numbers, sweeping shots and good matte paintings. Don't get me wrong, this movie is very far from the quality of the actual LotR films, but still manages to be truly entertaining and fun.

Don't take it too seriously, don't go in expecting a cinematic masterpiece, and don't let Boll's infamy cloud your judgement. This one is worth a watch... even two in my case, as I rewatched it years after seeing it for the first time, and was thoroughly entertained throughout; I'll probably rewatch it again after a few more years and enjoy it greatly once again.

I swear to God, it's ridiculous how much Burt Reynolds looks like one of the guards in Seyda Neen in Morrowind (that's ""The Elder Scrolls III"", a game from 2002, for those not in the know). It's glorious and I can't take him seriously at all.

This film is much, much better than people give it credit for. The same is not true for other Boll movies, I concur, but this one is pretty entertaining -- a perfect storm of ludicrous and wonderful. I thoroughly recommend it."

But they do not tell you that in the previews often and all I saw were the dazzling array of great actors. But actors are often the product of great direction and great writing. This movie lacked both. If I were Jason, or John, or Kristen, or Bert, I would gladly give back my fee and even a little extra to have every copy of this go the way the George Lucas wants the Star Wars Holiday Special to go.

It is sad how much I wanted this move to be great! Some of the back ground shots, the cgi, is amazing.

The real story: The player participates in a quest to save the land of Ehb from the forces of evil. The player controls the main character from humble beginnings as a farmer to a powerful hero or heroine. As the game progresses, the main character may be joined by other adventurers, who the player also controls. The background is based in a fantasy medieval world with a great geographic variety in open and closed environments (dungeons). The graphics are very detailed with intelligent environment changes.

But, it was sort of like they called these people up and said, ""How much to show up and stay till the final cut?"". Then paid them just that amount, gave them the scripts, started filming, but the had the director or producer work on something else. The acting was terrible. How do good actors act that poorly?

3438,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"Quote from the movie's opening lines:

Muriella (Leelee Sobieski): ""I knew you'd come."" Gallian (Ray Liotta): ""I told you I would."" Muriella (Leelee Sobieski): ""I mean, I felt it. I felt it before you came."" Gallian (Ray Liotta): ""You are developing your powers well, Muriella. Our time together is paying off!""

Pretty much encapsulates what's wrong with this flick. The dialogue is horrible, the script and director give the actors nothing meaningful to work with and the setup is completely cardboard in its appeal.

Don't get me wrong, cardboard can be entertaining, so long as some of the other elements of successful filmmaking come together, as well. No such luck, here.

As other reviewers have pointed out, the action choreography is lame, the camera work weak, the editing often insane, the art direction and cinematography limited or nonexistent, the musical score pointless at best...where to begin?

Well, I have nothing personal against a silly, anachronistic, amateurish action movie script that is concocted as a means of wiling away a harmless hour or two, even when it results in bad acting because of the director's complete lack of vision. It's kind of fun to observe how certain actors manage themselves in such a void. And as bad as he was in his role as King Konreid, Burt Reynolds was quite entertainingly cardboard, in my opinion. He walked right through the role playing his bored, wig-wearing self, and he was the only thing I could readily remember, months after I had seen this movie. He was so bad he actually stood out amongst this filmic muck...for the wrong reasons, of course.

A friend of mine had loaned me the DVD, along with several other movies he owns, but I couldn't be sure, months later, whether I had returned this one or something similar. So after searching my place recently to no avail, I was racking my brains for the name of the title, and I finally resorted to searching online using Reynolds' name and the word ""king."" That was all I could remember of this dud.

Pretty sad, huh? That my memory seems to be failing me. Or that Burt Reynolds in a miscast role is the most memorable thing in a movie starring Ray Liotta, also miscast, with Matthew Lillard, also miscast. The list of miscast actors taking away career embarrassment and (presumably, hopefully) a hefty paycheck in exchange for their participation in this $60m stinker continues most of the way down the line.

A possible exception, and what stands out in retrospect for me the most since my memory has now had a chance to be prompted by IMDb's cast listing for the movie, is that I was barely able to recall John Rhys-Davies or Kristanna Loken in their respective, fairly substantial roles here. I think this may be a compliment to the jobs they did, because it may mean that they turned in acting performances that rose above the level of outright ridiculousness, and they thereby avoided the WTF stare I was giving the rest of the cast.

I can't be sure, though. 'Cause none of this movie was memorable for the right reasons."

The movie is packed with second rate actors and lots of choppy scenes. It seems like it would make more sense if this movie was a made for TV movie. I like Jason Statham movies, but this one does not do him justice. Leelee Sobieski looked great and super hot in her armor, but she barely did anything in the movie. Yes the movie was a fantasy and there is no time period for the movie, but Burt Reynolds has a Texan accent leading a lot English knights. His part as king is not believable. Ray Liotta is the bad guy, but his acting did not fit his character either. He has a Brooklyn accent,and he is more comical than evil. I feel that James Marsteers would have made a better Villain. The coolest scene Ray has is when he fighting John Rhys-Davies's character. Matthew Lillard, the goofy Duke, kills the movie with some really bad acting as well. You are better off waiting for this movie to be on DVD and see it as a rental."
3442,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"Fortunately, I read a few reviews before watching this. I had already ordered it as part of my mail-in DVD program, so I was stuck with rental, even if I had been thoroughly warned by the folks here. At least I had low expectations now, so I wasn't disappointed when I discovered - yes - it's certainly was not up to what you'd think by looking at the famous names in the cast.

The actor who astounds me the most is Ray Liotta. What has happened to him since ""Goodfellas"" fame to do something like this? Has his career plummeted this bad, or did he just make a poor choice of roles to play? I can see Burt Reynolds taking anything since he's peak days are long gone, and Leelee Sobieski, because she's never been a star, but Liotta?

Actually, to present both sides, the action scenes, the costumes and the story overall are not boring and not the worst thing I've ever seen. Some of the special-effects were a lot of fun to watch, so it's not all bad.....but the dialog is horrendous. It totally ruins the film and makes the whole movie appear like some B-grade cheapie. It's why I also was disappointed to see Ron Perlman and John Rhys-Davies being part of this.

The worst acting performance in here, by far, was not Liotta but Matthew Lilliard as ""Duke Fallow,"" the son of the king. How Reynolds, who had a fine career, could work opposite this over-the-top guy and keep a straight face, is beyond me. Lilliard overacted so bad, it was embarrassing to watch. I can only hope he was supposed to act that ludicrously, but if that's the case his character is so annoying, it's not fun to view.

Jason Statham: well, I've had it watching his movies. I loved his early work (""Snatch,"" ""The Transporter,"" etc.) but now he's just a ridiculous action-freak-character, one of these guys who can beat up 50 people by himself in every film, especially this one, as ""Farmer."" I have to admit, however, I did like him using a boomerang as a weapon. I thought that was pretty cool. I like Claire Forlani, too, who played his wife.

Sadly, the dislikes far outweigh the likes and I can see why so many reviewers here panned this film. With this cast, I guess all of us expected a better film."

Knights in shining armor, castles, wizards, peasants... and a big war with humans vs ""Krug"" (Krug are a little similar to Orcs in Lord of the Rings).

Ron Perlman was hamming it up on autopilot, but at least his ham act wasn't half as objectionable to the ones put forth by Matthew Lillard and Ray Liotta, which were grossly annoying. Leelee Sobieski basically sleepwalked through this thing, reprising bad bits form her St. Joan effort of several years ago, and Jason Statham frowned and grunted his way through the film, whereas Burt Reynolds couldn't even bother to be conscious for it and stared his way through it all, projecting the most godawful monotone and excruciating boredom with the whole thing (remind me again: **WHY** does anybody consider this fossil an actor??!).

Im convinced that the writers took a good script for a fantasy epic, ate it, crapped it out, and wiped with the film and sent it to the theater. Thats would explain this atrocity to the genre.

Of course he'll be kicked in the balls again by hordes of geeks, but don't lead that fool you.

There are two kinds of failures: bad ones and boring ones. Boring movies are just unwatchable tedious, just like White Noise 2. Bad movies are just plain bad, like Boa vs Komodo. I seriously don't know how anyone could place Boll's flicks in the same league as they're clearly better. Dungeon Siege is not great, but neither bad nor boring.

The plot was ridiculous, everyone had different accents, and the dialog was some of the cheesiest garbage I've ever heard in my life! Plus, could it be any more obvious that the Krugs were just men in costume? And, who did the sound editing? Something would happen on screen, and there would be no sound to go along with it. Did anyone else notice that?

3459,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"I have scarcely the words to express how much I had wished that the presence of Reynolds, Rhys-Davies, Statham and Sobieski would have shielded the now proved tragically ephemeral majesty of the Dungeon Siege saga, from the influence of Uwe Boll.

Undefined characters, haphazardly thrown together for no apparent reason in randomly pieced together storytelling void of passion or heart, flailing aimlessly in and out of unchoreographed combat sequences with no apparent motivation, to a music score that seems as clueless about the plot as any other aspect of this movie. To cap it all off, some desperate unheard creative voice pollinated this putrifying corpse of a movie with surprisingly good special effects by comparison, perhaps in a last ditch effort to scrounge any scraps of production value.

I made myself sit through this movie, and the sequel, start to finish, as I had done with the Bloodrayne movie. I can honestly say I believe Uwe Boll neither glanced at the games, nor had the remotest intent to convey them in these works. In fact, if I'm perfectly honest I can find nothing in either movie to dissuade me from the conclusion that Mr. Boll created not only these two, but all his game-derived works, out of some malicious spite or searing hatred towards gamers and fantasy fans.

I pity any actor that is forced to have their life's work poisoned by this odious malcontent, and any story that must suffer the indignity and torture of being made into a lampshade in Boll's personal Buchenwald of film.

Unlike many others however, I would advise people watch at least as much of this film as they can stomach, to gain a deeper appreciation for the artistry of producing and directing a film. And, if for no other reason, as a warning. A warning that when stories as marvelous as the Dungeon Siege saga are brutalised and ravaged by Mr. Boll, silence.... is as bad as the crime."
3460,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"OK, I now understand the basis of all of the reviews of this movie take on the video game Dungeon Siege.

If this director ever chooses to do a movie version of Call of Duty its going to be a show stopper. I love how truly awful this movie is and I feel like a deer caught in headlights. I just can't look away. The cast is amazing yet the acting in wooden. Jason Staham and Ray Liotta star in a battle of good versus evil with sword fights with Matrix effects of Ray Liotta levitating, then floating. Clearly Liotta is a perfect ""devil"" with Matt Lillard playing his bitch with actual scenes of hell in this film and then Liotta has the audacity to knock up Jason Staham's wife Claire Forilani. Even the young and actually attractive Helen Hunt knockoff Leelee Sobieski and who could forget Burt Reynolds as the king.

A Uwe Bowl production unlike any I have seen in a very long time. Maybe after a few more shots of bourbon, I will figure out why I watched the entire 2 hours and 10 minutes on Showtime. At least it's Jason Statham and I guess they paid the actors really well."

Apart from Matthew Lillard, well sort of, nothing whatsoever works. The way the film is shot is in an incredibly shoddy and repetitive manner, and the film is one of the most ineptly directed films I have seen in years. And if that wasn't any worse, just listen to the dialogue, which is so clunky and juvenile. The story is too thin for the running time and the pacing is constantly on and off, while the characters are clichéd and I felt indifferent to every single one of them. The scenery is gaudy, likewise with the costumes, while the props look like fancy dress items more than anything else. The acting is also dreadful, Burt Reynolds and Ron Perlman can't do anything with their roles, Jason Statham is handsome and charismatic but his acting range is limited here and I have never seen Ray Liotta overact so embarrassingly than he did here.

The movie is meant to be a larger-than-life picture such as Lord of the Rings, but falls terribly short. So short in fact, that it is gut-wrenching hilarious. I have watched this movie more than almost any other movie I have seen. The acting is either overdone or underdone for most of the film. The script is bland and doesn't usually fit into the anticipated atmosphere of the scene. Jason S. uses a boomerang to kill ""Krug"" which are supposed to be like Orcs on LOTR. They look more like dirty Power Rangers. Burt R plays an emotionless king and is such a golden aspect of the unanticipated humor.

That is just hyped hate. I watched the movie last week on TV, knowing nothing about it. Did I think it was a good movie? No. But it certainly wasn't terrible either. It was just an okay movie like there are so many. But this one in the quite rare fantasy genre. It had bad parts in acting, fake scenery and generic story. But it also had decent to even good parts in the same area's, and the bad parts are not as bad as people here will have you believe. There was not much wrong with the fighting scenes, good fun I thought, and camera and directing were certainly not great, but I've seen much worse.

All in all it's a somewhat generic fantasy movie that does some things bad and some things good. I quite enjoyed watching it and was surprised to see all the hate in reviews. I sense a lot of bias though. People seem to love to hate this director, but I don't know him.

So as a completely neutral unbiased viewer I rate this film a 6.5/10 Quite alright for when you feel like watching a fantasy flick some night."

All these reviews on this film mentioning lord of the rings should watch this film as its own film and stop comparing it to a series of films that will never be matched in its genre (even tho I think they all sucked) I enjoyed this film, its was never going to be Oscar winning but its alright. Ray Liotta, Jason Statham and Ron Pearlman are all good actors and that alone gives you a reason to watch this. Burt Reynolds is king!!! That's genius in itself. I will stand up and say ""I ENJOYED THIS FILM"". Fight scene's are well done, the story is passable.

Then as I suffered through minute after minute of cheesy dialog my husband reminded me that it indeed was released in theaters?!? I was shocked! How could such anyone have ever payed to see this?! As I watched the poorly edited fight scenes with the Krug army, I was reminded of the slow-no-impact fight scenes of such laughable shows as Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. (The film quality was comparable) I kept laughing to keep from going into a rage! I've seen student films that had more depth and dimension than this waste of time.

The acting is bad, the cast is bad, Ray Liotta is bad acting and cannot even succeed to laugh naturally...

3473,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"I really have a love/hate relationship with Hollywood. So much in fact that I sometimes fantasize about going all-Rambo on the ""suits"". Film is not considered art anymore nowadays. It seems that whenever some lame-ass hack like Uwe Boll brings a film based on a video game to the big screen, the result is excremental (albeit from either his mouth or the other ""thing"" that, fortunately for you moviegoers, I won't mention to spare you the insanity). Boll's resume of films should have indicated to moviegoers that this ""film"" is gonna suck. And I can never understand why the hell Ray Liotta and Burt Reynolds are in this POS? I guess money goes a long way of snorting cocaine at the end of a ""hard days work"" should suffice but the latter states the obvious. With that being said, doing that provides ""remedial"" relief for the actors and critics who presumably were subjected to Boll's unique brand of ""film making"" which I'm sure gave them the feeling of being like Alex DeLarge in ""A Clockwork Orange"" forced to watch unspeakable horror.

If you are a bright, meek, intelligent individual, skip this excrement of Uwe Boll. If, however, you've never understood the meaning of ""curiosity killed the cat"" and went to see this anyway, you may suddenly find yourself in a catatonic state were there's very little chance of recovery.

3475,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"I'm sure this movie sounded like a good idea on paper. Why else would anyone bother to even attempt to put this mess together? It's pretty apparent that they were going for the whole Willow meets Lord of the Rings meets Kingdom of Heaven meets...you get the point. The end result is pretty abysmal to say the least. I've seen some really bad movies in my day, as I'm sure we all have. In the Name of the King makes a serious push to climb atop ""worst movies I ever saw"" lists everywhere. Bad story, bad acting, bad special effects, bad costumes, and hell, even the DVD menus suck. For about the first 10 minutes I was actually fooled into believing that this might not be a total train wreck. My optimism soon turned to despair as I got my first look at the evil creatures referred to as The Krug and I cringed for the first time of many as I immediately realized what I had gotten myself into. The Krug are a race of animal warriors but remind me more of villains from Power Rangers and thus lead to laughter every time you see them which I'm sure wasn't the intent of the filmmakers. Unfortunately this was only the beginning of my nightmare. Despite the fact that there is some decent acting talent in the movie, none of them really belong in this movie. I would be very surprised if whoever did the casting on this film still has a job. Burt Reynolds as the King? Ray Liotta as a sorcerer? Matthew Lillard as anything other than the quirky funny guy? The only thing worse than Lillard's horrible English accent is everyone else's complete disregard of one. Even Claire Forlani who is actually from England, decided to forego her natural way of speaking for this role. I guess she didn't want to show anyone up. I have to admit though, it is pretty funny to listen to how out of place Ray Liotta sounds with his Jersey accent in what's supposed to be some medieval time. When it comes to the fight scenes in the movie, they're actually not as bad as everything else, but I guess that's not really saying much. The fights could be pretty entertaining to look at if I could actually see them better. Bad camera angles and quick cuts negate what seemed to be respectable choreography but I guess we'll just have to take their word for it. The story is basically non-existent. If someone told me right now that this movie was 95 percent improvised, I wouldn't be shocked. Actually, I'd probably be a little bit relieved. The movie jumps around scene after scene not really doing or saying anything different from other movies of it's kind and not nearly as good. The dialogue will remind you of a junior high school play and I can probably say this again, not nearly as good. Altogether I'd say you can probably get a more enjoyable story by reading a kid a fairy tale at bed time. As if the movie wasn't bad enough, you really get nothing else on this disc. I don't know if there were different versions of this released but the version I got from Netflix has very poor special features. Then again I guess that's a good thing because once you're done watching this movie you probably don't want any more. Fact is, you're probably gonna want to stick it back in it's envelope, run to your nearest post office and make sure this gets back to them as soon as possible. I would've over nighted the thing to them if I could've. On another side note, this did not come to me in Blu-Ray as most of my movies do. I guess this movie looks so bad that Netflix did not want anyone to see this atrocity in high def. Speaking of Netflix, this teaches me a lesson. I am no longer gonna add everything they recommend to my list, especially when the first 15 to 20 movies in my queue are all on ""very long wait."" That's how you end up with a movie like this in your mailbox and disappointment in your heart :-( Sorry, veered off the review for a bit. In closing, from the outside looking in this movie might look like it deserves a chance. Epic battles, burning villages, hideous creatures, Burt Reynolds' ninjas (yes, I said Burt Reynolds' ninjas), and tree dwelling lesbians led by Kristanna Loken. Sounds fun but truth is I was looking at the clock the whole time and at the end I wasn't sure if I should be glad it was over or disappointed at the precious two hours of my life that I'll never see again. Honestly, I felt a little of both. If you feel the urge to watch this kind of movie just do yourself a favor and watch one disc of any of the Lord of the Rings movies and get on with your day. In the Name of the King gets half a star out of pity and another half a star just because Jason Statham is so freaking cool, even in this piece of garbage. Best line in the whole movie, ""Are you gonna fight, or talk me to death?"" So a grand total of one star or if you don't understand the star system, it's really, really bad! Rent at your own risk, buy only if you're 8 years old, stoned, or a really big Dungeons & Dragons fan."

Anyway, don't bother watching this. Don't even watch it for free, because you'll still want your money back.

3477,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"Ah, director Uwe Boll. How this man keeps on getting money to make movies is one of the great mysteries of the modern age.

Dungeon Siege is a terrible movie. What's surprising is that for the first time in a Boll movie, I at least found myself laughing at (some of) it instead of just wincing in pain. That's not to say bad movie lovers should go see it, but it might be worth a rental some time. If you're planning on being drunk.

The most astonishing thing about this piece of trash is the cast. True, many of them have seen better days in their careers, but have they really fallen this far? A good chunk of my amusement at this film was seeing a new actor/actress show up and laughing that they were even in this thing. I divided them into four categories while watching- horrible actors, apathetic not-even-trying bad actors, over-top-hammy bad actors, and Jason Statham.

Picture, if you will, Burt Reynolds as the king. Yeah... it was obvious even Burt couldn't picture it, and he doesn't even try. His nephew and heir? Matthew Lillard! How could anyone possibly take a fantasy epic with Burt Reynolds and Matthew Lillard as the only royalty in evidence as anything other than a joke? Lillard plays himself, and his hamminess is only outdone by Ray Liotta as the evil wizard villain. Liotta is so amazingly bad it's hard to believe he ever had a career.

Jason Statham actually appears to be trying, and the sheer amount of physical effort the man puts into the endless fight scenes and stunts is astonishing. Maybe he just doesn't know how to not try. He does a good job, but he certainly can't save this turkey from everything else that's wrong with it.

At over two hours long, the movie seems more like three or four hours long. To give Boll some credit, at least the score was decent. The plot and dialog are laughable- quite literally at some points. Whether or not you'll want to sit through the whole thing to laugh at those parts is kind of questionable.

One more thing. I almost forgot the synchronized ninjas. Amazingly enough, Uwe Boll even manages to make ninjas suck."

On the evidence he has provided (ie his films) he does not know how to evaluate a script, or cast actors, establish or develop characters, or anything else that relates to the job of 'Director'. Bearing in mind that his movies are produced with money from his own investment fund, he is obviously a highly skilled fund-raiser.

Many these days are clearly made for TV films but the values on this are far beyond the average. Since 'Lord of the rings' the film makers have seen that there is a place for these type of film. The only down side was the creature makeup let it down some as it was clearly basic masks with no 'hero' character with better makeup.

Now for the good parts,The locations were amazing to look at and a lot of work had gone into the buildings (should have aged the thatch though)the fight scenes are all you could want,up close and in the large fights you see the chaos of mêlée fighting between armies. I had no problems with any of the acting even though some people have knocked the dialogue its a d&d type of film and its what you would expect (thankfully its not full of thee's and thou's). At about 2 hours it has the time to tell the story well but do not expect any big surprises if you are a fan of this type of film as it ticks all the box's that you would expect.

I rate this movie way higher than The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emporer for instance.

Let me emphasize that this is no great movie, but a an okay fare for DVD with its beautiful (if once again unoriginal) images, okay effects, wooden acting and neat production design. It looks expensive as opposed to other Boll flicks.

Also the fight sequences are mighty fine with above average choreography."

Bert dragged out of mothballs and propped up on a horse? This movie was so truly terrible that my ten year old and I actually had fun pointing out the plot failures, the scene failures, the parts that were stolen from other movies....Ray Liotta looks like Wayne Newton trying to play a villain. Did I mention that SHAGGY was one of the bad guys? And what is with the ninjas and the acrobats with cleavage on ropes? There there was the Jolie look alike. The choreography for the fight scenes was pretty entertaining. Seriously, I loved the pointed feet on the flying leaf vixens and the ninjas, well that was just cute. This was a cross between Lord of the Rings, Die Hard, Jackie Chan and Dude, Where's my car. But I don't think that the director intended this to be a comedy.

Although the plot seemed to be multi facetted, it was obviously a well written script as everything falls in place as the movie progresses. It is inevitable that one compares this movie to the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy, however, one has to bear in mind that what LOTR accomplishes in three movies, Dungeon Siege has to in a short two hours. Unlike LOTR, Dungeon Siege also incorporates some well known actors and familiar faces of the silver screen. For those that found LOTR to be slightly drawn out, you would definitely love this movie. I see that this movie has not received the rating it deserves. However, that is because of the genre this movie falls place into. If you are a fan of fantasy novels growing up and adventure epics such as LOTR and the Chronicles of Narnia, then this movie deserves my utmost recommendatio"

He joins the king to fight evil wolfhounds and magicians because they killed his son and kidnapped his wife. The acting is pretty good as least for most of the actors. Jason Statham and Ron Perlman are the best. Matthew Lillard was upright annoying. He did good in Scooby Doo, but this kind of genre is not for him. Ray Liotta is so-so, might have been miscasted. There is some good scenery to look at. I also liked the music in the film. Not Lord of the Rings like, but still good. There are some holes in the plot and things that are misbelieved.

3493,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"OK, you know what? We've all had our fun with Uwe, and I'm no exception. I consider Uwe Boll movies to be a unique experience in cheese cinema, but I say this sincerely: I liked this movie. There.

It was MUCH better than Bloodrayne, which was laughably bad, and in fact I'd say Uwe was starting to get a handle on making movies that don't cause eyes to roll .

I know it sounds silly, but I liked these characters, the acting wasn't so terrible and the dialogue wasn't painful.

Flaws: The film ends too abruptly, and there are story details sort of pushed through in a clumsy way, and some of the acting is over the top.

It IS a cheesy movie (look out, there are NINJAS!!!), but this movie was much more fun than Eragon or Dungeons and Dragons. Plus, I can certainly appreciate Uwe's shaping of a fantasy world, it's mythology. I also appreciate how he went all out on the action and fantasy element.

The actors handled themselves very decently. I was very impressed with Burt Reynold's restraint as the King. I really had doubts about his part, but he did a decent job and did it subtley opposite Matthew Lillard's more frantic pacing (Lillard was having waaaay too much fun, lol)

Leelee Sobieski was adorable and John Rhys Davies was a joy to watch (and he's done some truly bad movies) Jason Statham, Ron Perleman and Will Sanderson were fun to watch as a trio of brothers in arms, and they carried some nice chemistry. Brian J White was particularly good also. Overall, the cast was not bad.

If you are one of the many that crusade against Uwe, my review will not make much of a dent, and it's a shame because maybe, just maybe he is getting better in small steps. But I have to be honest, I enjoyed this film."

3498,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"Uwe Bol has made some terrible films. I certainly won't defend his making crap like ""House of the Dead"" and ""Alone in the Dark"". And, I noticed that quite a few of his films are on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List...including this movie. But I also noticed that ""In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"", despite it's pathetic score of 3.8 that it's really NOT a bad film. Flawed, yes...but overall rather enjoyable if you like fantasy films.

The story is about an evil sorcerer (Ray Liotta) who is in league with a pathetic wiener, the King's nephew (Matthew Lilliard). And, using the sorcerer's power, he is able to make the brainless Krug attack the people of Ehb and in the surrounding countryside. Amazingly, the fate of the people all rests on the back of a simple farmer (Jason Statham) and his small band of allies.

So what are the film's weaknesses...other than having Uwe Bol's name on the picture? Some of the characters (in particular, Statham) are underwritten and wooden and a few of the casting decisions are strange...though they mostly work. Some of the dialog is a bit silly. And, sometimes the film was very easy to predict. But, if you turn off your brain and just enjoy the story, the great music and the lovely BIG cinematography, there is a good movie here. Great? Certainly not...but not a bad film at all...and one I found I enjoyed even though I was totally expecting to hate it.

By the way, I noticed some reviewers called it, essentially, a bad ""Lord of the Rings"" knockoff. Despite having John Rhys-Davies, the film really didn't seem to be trying to copy the trilogy. The closest movie to this one might be one more like ""Krull"" or ""Conan""...which is also quite watchable."

I have to admit that I was extremely disappointed on many levels. Ray Liotta...OMG. I have a Blu-ray and it doesn't do him any favors. And please explain the Liberace ensemble? Boo to casting and wardrobe.

Secondly, Leelee...should stick to independent films. She is the most boring actress and completely manly.

Then...the guy that plays Bastian looks like his next gig is the WWE.

Tarish...the black army commander...well...the guy is nice to look at (loved him in The Family Stone) but during the speech on the edge of battle, he completely lost his fake British accent and sounded like was doing a VERY bad impression of the great Martin Luther King, Jr.

And they casted SHAGGY!!!!! How the hell do you use the same actor from Scooby Doo and pick him above all the others that auditioned? Burt Reynolds...another bad casting choice. He looked like he has had some MAJOR work and didn't quit while he was ahead. He also looked like he was in a spoof movie...almost like he belonged in another Mel Brooks History of the World Movie.

And for every woman out there that loves Jason Statham...where was the gratuitous no-shirt scene?? His manager should be fired for EVER agreeing to this mess of a movie. Thank god Death Race rocked.

This one fooled me and I supposed a lot of you (judging by the high number of negative comments) because it had some really good actors on the cover- John Rhys Davies, Ron Perlman, Ray Liotta, etc.

The plot is boilerplate fantasy, but who cares. The director spends a huge amount of time on slow moving, boring sequences that don't move the plot along in anyway.

3506,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"This is my first Uwe Boll film. I have deliberately tried to keep an open mind on this director until I have actually seen one of his films. It sounds like a lot of people trash his films before they see them just because it is directed by him. I think that is both insane and unfair.

So I really had no idea of what to expect. After a few moments it was clear that this was a LOTR clone, with an infinitesimally smaller budget and done in a ""B-movie"" style. Taken on that level, my wife and I really enjoyed the film.

I honestly cannot fathom the hatred for Dr. Boll. The film was competently directed, and I found some of the photography breathtaking, the music beautiful, some really cool stunts and fight scenes, and found at least some of it really suspenseful. Whatever one may feel about this movie, to say it is done by someone who has NO talent is - in my opinion- a grossly unfair and unreasonable statement.

Yes, some of the acting was poor (the mother in particular), but most of the acting was fine and I took Liotta's role as a hammy-over-the-top performance that it was meant to be and really enjoyed him chewing up the scenery. You really can't take his scenes seriously - and I don't think they were meant to me.

The plot was decent, and made a lot more sense than the National Treasure 2 disaster I saw. And the movie experience was infinitely more pleasurable than sitting through any of the Star Wars prequels or Matrix sequels. And those were done by some of the most respected directors by both critics and audiences alike.

Personally, I think Dr. Boll was having fun with this film. And if I could fault him for anything it was to be too ambitious with a modest budget in a genre that has films like LOTR associated with it. But that can be viewed as a complement for a man who obviously is trying to stretch himself as a filmmaker.

I understand his other works may be turkeys (I will refrain from judgment until I see them for myself), but each film needs to be judged on it's own merits. Personally I found the Hulk, Matrix Reloaded and Phantom Menace to be real turkeys- so does that mean it's OK to call those directors 'the worst directors ever to have lived' and sign a petition to have them stop directing? This film struck me as a Saturday matinée experience - at 2pm with a bunch of friends and a big bucket of popcorn. A ""B"" movie to be sure, but one of the better ones to me.

No, this isn't a great movie, but an enjoyable one if you can let go of comparisons and previous comments about the director. When I see reviews start off with ""just like any other Boll film, you can expect garbage.."" it makes me wonder how many people really gives his films a chance.

Count me as a minority of one, but I look forward to seeing more of his films. Certainly more so than another film by Lucas or the Wachowski brothers.

I gave this a 7. If you want to take into consideration all the unfair crap this director has gotten, I would bump it up to an 8 just to help even out the score."
3507,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"Based on the PC game ""Dungeon Siege""; In the Name of the King takes you on a wonderful journey through your imagination You imagining that your 10 year old brother could have made a better movie than this film. I wanted to give it a solid chance because I have a guilty pleasure of enjoying fantasy/science fiction ""B"" movies.

Story  (this is the writer's first story) weak, uninteresting and no character development at all.

Screenplay  (this is the writer's first screenplay) the same problem as the story. It's a mess and a amateur attempt at that.

Dialogue  Dull, uninteresting, and just plain silly most of the time.

Directing-Producing- it's Uwe Boll; well known for getting sucker investors to fund his film work.

Casting  The miscasted actors are (in order): Ray Liotta, Burt Reynolds, Jason Stratham, Matthew Lillard and Claire Forlani. These respectable actors must have needed money to pay their delinquent taxes, child support or alimony.

Acting  The actors must have laughed off camera to have to speak such ridiculous dialogue. I would have loved to seen the out-takes. These are talented actors that appear talent-less in this film. Exceptions are Kristanna Loken and John Rhys-Davies who do pretty well in their roles.

Music  The score is underwhelming at all times. Completely dull and forgettable.

Color  The color is so washed out it almost looks like it was shot with 3 colors; black, white and brown.

Location  Lackluster location used for this film. Apparently, all the good locations in Canada were being used.

Camera work  At times, it seems like they have a child running around with a hand held camera. The camera is jumpy and does amateur like zoom ins.

Fight Action scenes  Fair to poor and at times, silly. (Not sure how the main character appears to be the best fighter in the land without any training).

This is the worst movie I've ever seen.and perhaps; the worst movie ever made. I couldn't get this rented DVD back in it's NetFlix sleeve fast enough. I sincerely believe Producer and Director Uwe Boll is the Ed Wood of our time. Now I just want the 2+ hours of my life back please."
3508,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"I hate admitting that I wasn't drunk or high when I rented this. I like Jason Statham, Ray Liotta, Matthew Lillard, and several other cast members. Although I had my doubts that any of them could pull off a fantasy movie, I was willing to give them a chance. What I failed to notice was that Uwe Boll was directing this steaming pile of crap. My bad. So so my bad.

Even if you were willing to give it a try and suspend a lot of disbelief (Like how did people have those haircuts in that time period), the next clue that you made the wrong viewing choice comes pretty quickly -- the moment the ""movie"" starts, the ""score"" starts, and it is so obnoxious and distracting that I'm sure it was intended to cause sensory overload so viewers wouldn't notice everything else that was wrong. It was nothing short of aural rape.

I really can't find a single positive thing to say about this movie. Whoever is still giving money to Uwe to make movies, I urge you to stop."

I love action/violence in movies, even the cheesy ones, but this was simply unbearable. Burt Reynolds as the king was unbearable. That guy that is Farmer's friend (he played Hellboy) has the worst dialogue and mannerisms in any character of a movie I've seen. I rented this for $1 and I actually regret it....

This film has the worst plot line ever and follows many of the same old story lines used over and over. Same old breaking gender roles. The script writing? Phenomenally bad. I don't care who you are, no actor could pull off lines like that.

Actors: +1. If you want an evil doer in the film, find someone other than Ray Liotta. No matter how hard he tries, his voice sounds as if in a perpetual childhood. For a more kingly venture, follow in the footsteps of Sean Connery. Or get Tom Selleck for crying out loud. But, Burt Reynolds? Dear God, no! The only actor worthy of any praise is Jason Statham whose fight scenes are entertaining to watch.

Sets: -10. The imagery is CG and so obvious my 2 year old nephews would believe ""Labryinth"" before this film. It's very much Lord of the Rings on a $10 budget. That or he paid the middle school tech guys in coffee and donuts.

Costumes: -5. Who fights with a cape? Since when can a peasant afford nice clothes? Be original! Honestly, there is not one redeeming quality or aspect to this film whatsoever. It was boring, far below mediocre and, quite frankly, painful to watch at times. I'm actually embarrassed for the actors.

Instead of watching this movie and wasting your time, pick up ""Last of the Legion"" which is too short to really get into the detail it needs but at least is entertaining. And they all have Colin Firth's accent at least."

Does anyone know how to make a decent fantasy movie? LOTR was great, it had drama, suspense, and a thrill here and there; however it took YEARS to make and it shows the hard work. This movie was like how to edit in the worst possible way, how to completely make something that isn't worth being laid in a cat box.

It is almost as bad as the rash of ""DVD-Camera"" movies I have been seeing lately. Do studios have a QC Department or is it about have fast can you drop dribble at your local AMC Theater?

3512,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"This movie was probably the worst movie I have seen in many many years. I have unknowingly seen Uwe Boll films before this one, but did not know this was the same director as those other flicks while watching. So, I can say truthfully that I am about as un-biased as I can get with this review.

That being said, where do I start? The horrible score? The amazingly childish dialog? The half cooked story? Or the incredibly poor character development?

First off, the person responsible for writing this story seems to have ripped off nearly a dozen different fantasy films without bothering to veil the attempt. And the screenplay appears to have been written by a 13 year old. For example: Each scene simply jumps from one thing to another without any connection at all. They show you something, and say ""here are these people and this stuff, look at them for a moment"". And a second later they show you something else and say ""here look at this now"". No continuity or connection at all! I truly felt lost after the first 20 minutes. And believe me, I am not at all easy to lose in a movie. Even really bad ones! The dialog is choppy at best, at worst it's moronic. And integral characters pop up randomly, say ""Hi"", and then vanish till they are needed. Like flash cards before a test. If this had been a book before it was made into a movie, I would almost think the screenplay was written from the Cliff's Notes of that book.

And now for the Score! Oh my god! I have never seen a movie scored so badly. I mean I have heard 8 bit video game music more compelling and better placed than this. There are parts of this movie where you are watching and you want to feel something, but you can't! And it is because the music is either utterly goofy or far too weak. And you are left with this empty ""why am I bothering"" feeling that makes you want to just turn it off.

And I truly feel so very bad for the actors in this film. One of the big draws for this movie is the tremendous star power it holds. OK, I know a lot of you are snickering at Burt playing the part of the King. But I really think he would have been great if he had been Directed right. There were scenes here that really screamed for that Burt Reynolds charm, but instead he had an almost robotic dialog that I couldn't believe was coming from him. Oh, and Ray Liotta. Holy moley! Ray, you could have been awesome as an evil mage! I was sooo disappointed by the lack of character development there. I have to say one of the major reasons I wanted to see this movie was, Ray Liotta as the big evil. On the plus side, John Rhys-Davies held up OK in his roll. But then, having so recently done the ""Lord Of The Rings"" films, he had something of an advantage over many of the other actors. But still, his character again suffered from that really poor development. The only character the writers and director seemed to have felt it necessary to put forth any effort on was Jason Statham's. And that was poorly managed at best. Where there should have been mystery, there was half said lines. Where there should have been epiphany, there was apathy. And the point at which there should have been a profound sense of justice, there was lack of surprise and tired, overused, one liners. A third of the way into this film I was bored. Towards the end I simply had a very mild curiosity about how it would finish out.

The only real compliment I can give this movie is, the well choreographed fight scenes featuring Jason Statham. But to tell you the truth, I think he's done better work in his other films myself.

So in short, if you wish to see a really bad film. Or perhaps you are really incredibly bored. Quite frankly, I would say watch something else. This wasn't worth the time it took to watch. Much less the slot on my Netflix schedule."

Give it up already!

Im just tired of unintelligent internet community slating good enjoyable films. OK so this film wasn't Lord of the Rings, was it advertised as LOTR? Apart from John Rhyss Davies did it have any other connections with LOTR? NO! It was a completely different story. I found this film to be enjoyable, OK not Oscar material but this film was entertaining none the less. The characters were good, and completely in line with the Game. The whole film felt like Dungeon Siege. I have played the game and completed it, and I can say that Uwe has captured that feel in the movie. The cinematography is very good, especially where Merricks daughter is riding away from the Duke. This film also has a kicking soundtrack, some great actors, and its a lot of fun to watch. The only bad thing about the film is Matthew Lillard, he hammed up his role the way only he can, he should be shot! If you want an entertaining film that will delight the family this is it, if your after a multiple Oscar winning film (The voting was rigged!) then watch LOTR.

3516,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"I'm not going to bore you with any of the plot mainly because there was no plot. If you saw Bloodrayne then you know exactly what this film is like. No character development at all. No exposition or explanation of any key plot point. The dialog is forced and hackneyed. The performances of virtually every cast member are disjointed and senseless. There is not a single time in the film when a character reacts to anything in a way that makes any sense at all. I personally saw hints of what might have been a few decent performances,(namely by Ron Perlman and Leelee Sobieski) but there is no way to know because if there was originally any good in there it was edited out.

My recommendation, do not see this movie. I do have a few questions though. How does Uwe Boll keep getting work? And why do seemingly decent actors keep agreeing to work with him?

3518,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"Set in the medieval kingdom of Ehb, a man known only as Farmer is caught up in the battle for the kingdom. A powerful magus by the name of Gallian is using magical powers to control the orc-like Krug. Also working with him is Duke Fallow, the King's nephew, who wants power for himself. Farmer wants nothing to do with the war but when his son is killed and his wife taken he has no choice if he is to save her. He heads off in search of her with his friends Norick and Bastian; together they face various difficulties and are ultimately separated. Farmer later learns a hidden truth about himself before helping lead the fight against the Krug and ultimately facing Gallian.

I was surprised to see just how negatively reviewed this film has been; it may not be great but it is far from terrible. There is plenty of impressive action; this is exciting and stylishly choreographed by Siu-Tung Ching. The story may contain many clichés but just about every film in this genre does to some degree. Jason Statham does a solid job as Farmer and there is solid support from Ron Perlman as Norick. Some people weren't too keen on Matthew Lillard's performance as Duke Fallow but I rather liked it; the character was never meant to be heroic in anyway. Not all the performances impressed though; I never bought Burt Reynolds as the king and the less said about Ray Liotta's Gallian the better... he was more camp than commanding; certainly he never looked a match for Statham. While the highlight of the films were the battle scenes there were other impressive moments; I particularly liked the mysterious women of the forest and the way they moved on long vines. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the genre; it may not be the best example but neither is it the worst that I've seen, by quite some way."

3520,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"A good surprise. I knew Dungeon Siege not from the video game, but from the comics, and I enjoyed this movie version. The script is nothing particularly new, but the acting is decent and the photography (which wants to imitate Peter Jackosn's ""Lord of the Rings"") is not bad at all. I liked Ron Perlman and to see Burt Reynolds as a sort of old King Arthur was a pleasant surprise. Statham is not Mortensen, for sure, but he's not a bad choice for the role. Orcs like creatures, castle's dungeons which remind very much Saruman's tower, magic forests and an evil sorcerer (even if Ray Liotta is the only one I would not have chosen to play this part)gives to the movie a Tolkienanian air which I liked. The secret is not to take the whole thing too much seriou"
3521,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"Got the film through a friend and thought why not have a look, it couldn't be that bad. I was watching it while I worked on my computer so not paying that much attention, but when ever I sat and watched a few moment I was struggling to figure out why it looked so bad. I came here and found out why. Uwe Boll has done it again. No one man can completely ruin a film more successfully the he can. Lets list the problems for fun. The lighting was atrocious, no grading to add depth. Special fx weren't that spacial. The script was well lets just say a room of monkeys could do better. The actors I thought could save this but they didn't, it looked as though in each scene they were repeating a mantra in their heads ""think of the money, oh god just think of the money"" Cus their performances looked phoned in at best. The worst part was the mains are all decent actors to begin with so this must have been directing that failed them.

Oh well at least I didn't pay money to see this. haven't seen the ending yet and doubt I ever will, as I have no desirer to finish this steaming pile Of sh#t. Uwe Boll please oh please do us all a favor and stop making films, even the worst films out of film school are leaps and bounds above your's. Uwe Boll I know you think you can direct but I wouldn't let you direct traffic. don't watch this film unless you have to."
3522,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"Well, I've pretty much read a lot of reviews and comments about Uwe Boll and his series of game to film adaptations, I have seen I think five of them, namely House of the Dead, Alone in the dark, Bloodrayne 1 and 2, and this film, and I have also seen one of his earlier films before he began with his game to film trend, a film called Sanctimony, and to be honest, I wouldn't call Uwe Boll the worst director of all time, but I will definitely say his more of a lazy director, by that I am referring to his idea of casting.

Take for example if you go back to Bloodrayne, it was more like Boll just picked a few names off the top of his head, instead of really thinking who would really be able to bring the characters to life, I mean come on, I'll bet even a first year film student wouldn't put someone like Micheal Madsen in a film where he doesn't belong, and this film where even my parents, who are not even big movie freaks, said that Jason Statham, Ray Liotta and Burt Reynolds didn't really belong in this film, although Uwe does show that he does want to make films, but he seems to have a knack for taking shortcuts.

My advice to Mr. Boll would be if he wants people to stop writing such reviews that are so harsh, that Niagara Falls won't be able to wash him clean, and trust me I have read some really harsh reviews, he should stop with this lazy ass B.S of his and make a film the way his suppose to, but hey he doesn't have to take me seriously I am just another film geek who posted another comment on IMDb, but keep in mind and this I know for sure, guys like Peter Jackson, Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese never took shortcuts with films they made, and thats why they have tasted Oscar gold.

Finally, I am going to issue a dare and honestly, I hope somehow this part finds its way to Uwe Boll, either start making movies the way your supposed to or go back to Germany and think about taking up a career in filming wedding receptions, just be careful not to screw that up, because you wouldn't want to be at the front end of an angry bride's fist, because no boxer can pack punch when it comes to a brides special day.

So, Uwe Boll, your choice, think about it."

Another question is who let Uwe Boll direct - the blighter should not be let within 10-mile range of any major film studio. The acting in the resulting... err... product is more two-dimensional than that of the computer-generated characters in the game, the costumes and props are worse than those you'd expect to see in a Sci-Fi Channel Saturday night special, the CG is laughable... and again, what the HELL is Leelee Sobieski doing here?

The actors are all pretty good, but the editing seems to have been done by a complete beginner... it really spoils everything, as you end up getting confused by some bad transitions instead of getting interested in the story.

The story, mind you, is very plain. It starts with a Lord Of The Rings graphical touch, you can almost see the Hobbits coming... then it turns into Gladiator, almost to a complete rip-off, even the music, then it plunges into Star Wars when you can almost hear ""I am your father, Luke""... so nothing new at all, which isn't always really a problem if all the rest of the movie makes up for it, but nope. Here we have dreadful unprofessional editing combined with what must have been bad directing (since the actors seem competent from their prior work I'm familiar with) and a boring story. The special effects are decent, but some bad transitions manage to spoil them too.

Overall one of the least enjoyable movies I've seen in a long time. Watch it if you want to see for yourself how good movie editing usually is!"

3536,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"Apart from the fact that we know Uwe Boll as being one of the worst directors of all-time, we also know him due to the fact that he likes to copy the likeness of other films ( That are actually successful ) in a blatant rip-off kind of fashion. He has many times ripped off the Matrix with many hilariously terrible slow motion sequences and has copied Alien a few times with his design and name for monsters. It seems now it is Lord of the Ring's turn to be made a fool of.

For some unknown reason i cannot quite put my finger on Uwe Boll keeps being able to cast grade A actors like Burt Reynolds, Ron Perlman, John Rhys Davies & Ray Liotta. However, this is combined with absolutely horrible B movie actors such as Matthew Lillard ( Yeah, Scream was an exception ) and the horrendous Will Sanderson, of which the latter is in nearly every one of Boll's films. It is a weird combination of great and terrible actors and it doesn't work. None of the grade A actors deliver a convincing performance in the film except for possibly John Rhys Davies. However, none of them seem to be truly touched by the 'Boll' syndrome of acting. It seems more like these great actors could not convince anyone because of the poor script, Spouting out lines no actor could have said convincingly such as: 'Life.... has never been more exciting!!'. It does mean, however, that this is one of Boll's better films ( Or shall we say, 'least bad'? ) because of the fact the acting is ever so slightly less terrible than a lot of his previous efforts. I still have to mention that performances like Matt Lillard's, Will Sanderson's & Leelee Sobieski's in this film are still absolutely atrocious and beyond the concept of 'horrible'.

Jason Statham is, as always, Jason Statham. That unfazed dead eyed rock of masculinity. Unfortunately, this is a role that requires some emotional depth, and the scene where Statham is burying his son is laughable due to Statham's performance because he shows absolutely no emotion whatsoever. Once again, i get that Statham is supposed to be this tough guy that is too 'cool' for crying, but this moment really makes his character cease to be human. Was Maximus in Gladiator a wimp? No, he was the definition of cinema 'masculinity', but what did he do when he saw his wife and son dead? He gave an extended sob fest which is exactly what every human being would do at this sight no matter what your personalities are. It made him human, and it never felt out of character for a minute. Ofcourse Statham doesn't have any emotional range, so he could never have pulled off a scene like that, but it does make you wonder about this horrendous casting. Let us also not forget the hilariously wooden responses of both Sobieski & Sanderson after seeing a loved one die. There is not an ounce of emotion in their faces at all during these scenes.

There are too many obvious greenscreens in the wideshots. Especially one in particular with Burt Reynolds setting out with a small army outside his castle has terrible CGI and special effects, which is also one of Boll's trademarks. Some of the side shots of this sequence seem to be filmed on location without CGI, and the visual change between edits in this scene are just ridiculous. Also let us not forget to mention that a couple of particular catapult 'firebombs' also look like absolute garbage. The lighting is many times much too bright and the sets look obviously artificial.

The enemies in are 'Krugs', which might aswell have been called 'Orcs', because this seems like a blatant Lord of the Rings ripoff. Gallian ( Ray Liotta ) is the villain. We do not know why he is the villain, but he is the villain. His motivations or reasonings for his actions are never shown. It looks like Henry Hill entered a multi dimensional time machine and ended up in a fantasy medieval world, which really goes to show how miscast Liotta was.

Action sequences are a bit better than a lot of Boll's previous films but there is still loads of quick cutting and shakycam action going on. It is still a difficult task to tell what is going on during a fight sequence. The film doesn't really have a narrative, and there are a lot of these extended fight sequences that take up the entire runtime, so the lacking choreography and mediocre editing really does become even more noticeably as time goes by.

In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale has poor and wooden acting, a terrible script with horrendous dialogue and many blatant LOTR ripoffs, ( A lot of the still frames look like ugly & cheap copies of the beautiful stills of LOTR ), terrible characters & ugly production values. Even though as stated before the acting is wooden ( Particularly when friends or family of characters die ), performances of John Rhys Davies do still shine a little bit and in combination with its scale and the pretty decent music it is still one of Boll's greatest efforts.

I saw other people saying : "" In dungeon siege u start as a Farmer and what did Uwe Boll think lets name the main character Farmer"", or at least something like that, the fact is that it is explained at the beginning of the movie why they called him Farmer, it was popular in those ages that a man would be called by his craftsmanship, Blacksmiths where usually called by that name, and not many ppl gave importance to what their real name was. About the story, it's pretty much classic, girls gets in love with the wrong guy, a traitor relative, a lost son of the king, bla,bla,bla....

About the only positive thing that can be said about this movie is it's not the worst thing Uwe Boll has directed. I am dumbfounded how he was able to assemble a cast of otherwise reputable actors. The film can't decide if it wants to be serious or a comedy. I understand the sword and sorcery aspect but can't figure out where the ninjas or Cirque du Soleil performers fit in. Its also interesting that the only person not wearing armor seems to come through without a scratch. Despite a reputable cast the lines are delivered like the actors can't wait to pick up their paychecks and go home. It might actually have helped if there was some continuity. You pretty much have to figure out on your own how the different plot line and scenes m
3551,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"It seems to be very popular among reviewers to pan this film. I think it depends on what you value as a viewer. If you are a fan of the fantasy movie realm (eg. Lord of the Rings) and especially if you are a fantasy role-play gamer (eg. Dungeons and Dragons, Warhammer Quest, etc.), I think this movie has a lot to offer. I have to say that I enjoyed myself thoroughly the whole way through.

Firstly, the setting is sublime - I think everyone would have to agree with that comment. Vancouver Island has never looked so majestic - the mountains tower over gorgeous lakes with a rugged pastoral quality mixed in for good measure. The castles are extremely well done as well. Overall, I think Vancouver Island stands up nicely to the epic landscapes of New Zealand in this film.

The armour and weaponry are absolutely first rate. Again, if you're not a fan of medieval constructs, this might not hold much sway for you, but for me, it was sublime. The armourers did a tremendous job of creating a unique look for the different ranks (from royalty to elite guard to the rank-and-file), and the Krugs had that nasty kind of raw iron look to both their armour and weapons.

Next, the fights were extremely well done. I would say that the fights were more varied, more realistic, and more skillfully done than those in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which is high praise indeed. The sheer numbers involved in the mass battles were also awe inspiring. I think they actually had several hundred actors playing those scenes out, not just 20 or 30 and CGIing the rest. Speaking of special effects, the budget wasn't huge, but what was done was effective and fairly original.

As for the acting and storyline, it wasn't of the same calibre as Lord of the Rings. Several actors in the cast put in wooden and amateur performances. However, I found myself drawn to several of the characters: John Rhys-Davies, Burt Reynolds, the head of the royal guard, and the main character (Jason Statham). Statham was convincing in his ""First Blood Rambo"" sort of way - a super proficient fighter who just wants to be left alone to his simple ways. The storyline is not grandiose or particularly original, but really, there are very few original story lines in film; for audiences to connect with a theme, it must strike familiar chords. This plot touches on many of these well-worn archetypal patterns: the long-lost son returns, the good mage turns mad with power, the honest man overcomes, the power-hungry entitled nephew gets what's coming to him, the peasant outdoes the royalty, etc. I don't see this as a negative - these plot lines are part of the greatest stories in history as well. Are they brilliantly pulled off in this movie? I wouldn't say so, but they are not badly done either.

Anyway, this is certainly not a perfect film, but there are many very fine elements to it. If you love seeing this type of world put into film, I think you will find much to enjoy."
3552,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"OK I am glad I did not pay 9 bucks to see this in the theater.

But for an afternoon watch it wasn't bad.

Kinda like a long episode of Xena or Herculese. Krugs look silly and totally inept yes, acting was so so. Story was cliché yeah. (Find a story thats not people, and if you do managed, find a good one thats not.

If you expect LOTR do please use the gray matter between your ears. LOTR based on the premier high fantasy by the master author, JRR Tolkein.

Dungeon Siege, based off of a computer hack and slash (a good one mind you) It far outshines Beowulf, and Earagon. Personally I put it better than willow too.

Another positive was the fact that the women did not all run around dressed in bikini's through the entire flick."
3553,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"This was extremely painful to watch, more than the norm. Everyone thats in this movie are entirely wrong for it. I knew I was in trouble once Burt Reynolds appears on the screen. And what in the world was Jason Statham thinking of when he decided to do this. It is COMPLETELY out of his element, so much so that you would think that this is some sort of Lord of the Rings spoof. It is horrible and a complete mess. The only one who wasn't Over Acting was Claire Forlani! Lets face it, people, its just not a good story and at times I wanted to stop the DVD. I had no idea that this was based off a video game and now that I know that (from the credits), this inspires me to never play that video game. Ray Liotta is his usual over the top self as the bad guy with that crazy laugh of his and yet it doesn't work for him here. Other than playing a wonderful Shaggy in Scooby Doo, Matthew Lillard is just a plain bad actor and an annoying one at that. How does he still get roles? Did he make a deal with the devil? Leelee Sobieski may have decided to do this because she wasn't getting the roles she wanted. she has to be better than this picture. Ron Pearlman was completely flat and just looked as if he was going through the motion and wanted to get this film done in a hurry. Everyone, even the two decent actors (Forlani and Rhys-Davies)were just out of place. It was like watching bad actors at a Reinnassance Festival. Jason Statham does not belong in the middle ages. He is his same old deadpan self and that deadpan delivery doesn't fit here. He only real role is to speak until it time for action and in films like Crank, War and The Transporter, it works, in this film that deadpan delivery just don't cut it.

I clearly blame the director, who's movies that he directed have all been bad (Alone in the Dark, BloodRayne, House of the Dead). It is clear that he doesn't have command of the English language or he wouldn't have accepted these wooden, lifeless, lines deliveries that the principal actors all gave. I am telling you, you will get bored with this movie before you get a third, heck, a quarter of the way through. Do yourself a favor, when you reach that point, just go ahead, eject the DVD because it's not worth seeing this movie to the end.

3555,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"Uwe Boll has gotten a lot of flack. All of it deserved. I had no idea this was his movie until the film started. However, I found that it proved that he CAN make a decent flick. As soon as I found out it was a Boll picture the bar dropped considerably. The cgi was stunning for the most part (admittedly, there were a couple of bits that could have used a touch of refinement), and the action sequences were quite well choreographed. I was definitely surprised at such a large, well-known cast of heavy hitters, all of whom put in a good performance (though I don't think any of them will be getting awards for this film.) Jason Statham is one of my current favorite actors, and I find that he did a great job in a non-modern piece. Give it a try, go see it once, and don't hold the bar too high. It's a good film, just don't expect it to be gre"

She should be riding with the boys, but instead they throw her in the trunk. There's something wrong with the world when a girl like her has to work in parts like this. I say, get her out of the pit pronto. A good-looking girl would surely befit a good-looking movie, and good-looking it is. With the help of drifting dust, changing light and twinkling stars (both heavenly and human), producer-director Uwe Boll and cinematographer Mathias Neumann have created an atmospheric epic that keeps viewers engaged front to back. The tree-dwelling forest elves with sometime Terminatrix Kristanna Loken in the part of saucy elf queen Elora are my personal favorites. I recommend the sequel explore her fling with the magician's daughter (Leelee Sobieski) in more detail. Fine performances by Jason Statham as the not-so-reluctant warrior and Matthew Lillard as his well-oiled rival. All in all, a lot better than expecte"

3559,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"In the Name of the King, the latest film from Uwe Boll. Boll the whipping boy of film fans everywhere continues to make movies despite the fact that people ""hate his films"", which they go to even though they hate them. Yes I've disliked a number of his films, House of the Dead is one of the worst films ever made; Alone in the Dark is horrible, but plays better if you come in 25 minutes in and can make up what you've missed; and BloodRyne I liked, despite performances that ranged from good to nonexistent because it reminded me of the Italian Fantasy Films of the early 1980's. Boll is back in theaters with one of four films released world wide in 2007. (2007 is a busy year and included his boxing, literally, critics who despised his films-he won)

The plot of the film has something to do with Jason Statham, a farmer going off to take revenge after an evil horde invades his town, kills his son and kidnaps his wife. He travels with Ron Perlman and several other in a quest that leads them into several big battles and to the castle of the evil wizard Ray Liotta.

Watching the film I came to a rather odd conclusion, this is actually a pretty good, if very dense little film.The film looks good. the actors are all pretty much on the same page, the action is nicely staged, and the story is light years better than most of the direct to video films that were spawned by Lord of the Rings. This plays very much like we are in a real place so is unlike the dress up/ Ren Faire we've been getting lately (the Dungeons and Dragons films anyone?) I liked the film enough to look forward to getting it on DVD and the hunkering down and watching it on a rainy Sunday with my brother.

To be certain the film is not perfect. I could see tell at the outset that Boll's means of casting (through lots of money out close to the time they shoot in order to get any actor in need of quick cash to get bigger names then he has a ""right"" to) was going to be a problem in a few places. First off its going to produce a cast with accents all over the place, Ray Liotta, Jason Stratham, John Rhys-Davies, Leelee Sobieski and Burt Reynolds are all in different places vocally. Its also a problem in that the acting styles clash, with Liotta seemingly out of place and Reynolds, whom I never ever expected to see in a film like this, a bit too knowing.(I won't discuss the hair styles of any of them because that would take too long)

If the film itself has any problems its that its a long dense haul.A great deal happens and is discussed and after a about an hour I did begin to wear down. I'm sure once this hits DVD or cable it will play better where there can be breaks.

Boll is growing as a director. He's made a decent little fantasy. I look forward to seeing this again, and I'll even go see the threatened sequel.

never thought i'd say this but i actually enjoyed the movie. its very average and very cheesy and yes, once again he managed to pull pretty poor performances out of fantastic actors. But something about it kept me watching and ended up with me actually having a pleasant taste in my mouth for a change.

nothing ground breaking and a very run of the mill sword and sorcery adventure but fun and worth a watch.

well done Uwe you didn't completely ruin a movie...finally! There may be hope for you yet although i don't think we'll ever forget alone in the dark!"

3562,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"I just managed to get through this god awful movie. Absolutely horrific.

Again with the video game adaptations.When will Hollywood learn its lesson? I must say Uwe boll has once again managed to scam money from somewhere, then convince a fairly decent cast to play in this awful movie that tries to be like the lord of the rings but fails miserably. I suppose Boll has his own little obsession with Lord of the Rings , every shot in the movie looks like its been stolen from the trilogy of the rings. The Krugs or whatever they are called are a miserable attempt to look like Orcs. Gallian's domain also tries to look like its Mordor but also fails miserably. The worst of all were those female forest warriors who remind you of the Elves but stupidly are swinging about like tarzan and while doing it they have this silly pose you expect peter pan to have and not the elves.

I always hated Uwe boll movies but this one takes the prize. Why do they keep letting him direct this stuff? Its not like Hollywood is running out of good scripts and good directors.

Don't watch it. Nothing in this movie is original or even close to that. don't waste your time on a piece of garbage that has no characters no plot and certainly no entertainment value what so ever."
3563,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"This is absolutely the most gawd-awful piece of cinema I have ever seen. The only reason to even classify this as cinema is because of its medium. This ""project"" is an example of something that should have gone straight to DVD. Almost all of the actors simply drew their past experiences from other movies they have participated in to help define their roles in this movie.

Jason Statham - Imports his role from the Transporter into this film.

LeeLee Sobieski - Imports her role as Joan of Arc, reluctant savior of the Kingdom of ""Ed"".

Burt Reynolds - Imports his nonchalant attitude from just about every movie he has ever done. The only thing missing is his half winded giggle.

Matthew Lillard - Imports his persona from the first Scream movie.

Ray Liotta - I don't know where he tapped into to get ready for this role but it was simply ridiculous to watch. Ray, I know Saruman, I've worked with Saruman and Ray you are no Saruman.

John Rhys Davies - Actually the only actor to give a decent performance in this movie. I think the only reason he signed on was to give it some credibility following his success from Lord of the Rings.

The costumes weren't too bad but the getup that Ray Liotta had was just nothing short of idiotic. He looked like a wanna be Liberace. I half expected him to start playing the piano as he described his plans to his captives.

Some of the dialogue was half-assed as well. In one of the scenes towards the beginning, I heard something like ""C'mon over here"". I swear I almost expected that phrase to end with Dude. The mishmash of accents or lack thereof was pretty horrid too.

Overall if you are masochistic and want to see a movie that tries hard to be LOTR meets LOST then you will not be disappointed."

It was like they took one of the writers from Lord of the Rings, and one from Troy....held a gun to their head and said write me a movie in 30 minutes or else you will die.

With that said, some of the fight scenes were cool, but it is hard to take either Ray Liotta or Burt Reynolds seriously. They seem to play the same character as they did in previous movies...only in mid-evil clothes.

I can't imagine anyone out there (even on the internet) is THAT stupid to consider this a good movie."" How I wish I was paid by who? Uwe Boll? For giving this movie full stars. I don't care who made it, who the director was, the producer, the writer, or if it was original, based from some game or book, I don't care either who the actors were. I criticize movies based on what it is, a movie. And with that said, ""In the Name of the king"" is a good movie if you look at it as it is.

Compare it with Lord of the Rings? I can't imagine anyone out there (even on the internet) is THAT stupid to compare this good movie to Lord of the Rings.

C'mon! Comparing this movie to LotR is like comparing apples to oranges. Two totally different league. This movie's simplicity earned my full star vote. Yes there are some miscalculations and bad editing, but overall it is a good movie if you look at it as it is."
3567,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"When I saw that this movie first, was inspired by a computer ""role-playing"" game, and, second, included Burt Reynolds as a supporting actor, I went in with low expectations. Those expectations were unfounded, and those two factors were both deceptive: the plot and characters were surprisingly well-crafted, and Reynolds put in what may be the performance of his career. (That may not be saying much, I'll admit, but it's something.) The acting all around is quite good, particularly at spots (most of them Ray Liotta's) where the action lent itself to over-the-top bravura but the performers opted for a more subtle approach. Some of the plot twists you can see a mile away, and others come out of nowhere, so while you know things are going to work out in the end the viewer can't be quite sure how it's going to get there. The only part I didn't care for, and that not by much, was seeing, without comment or explanation, two black men in charge of the army in what is clearly a society based on medieval Europe -- Brian J. White and Ron Selmour are both fantastic and deserving actors, but as out of place logistically speaking as the equally distracting lin-kuei (Chinese ninjas) who also serve in the King's army. Despite dead-on performances from both Reynolds and Leelee Sobieski, the film isn't going to win any Oscars, except maybe for the completely natural-looking visual effects or the dead-on costuming (lin-kuei notwithstanding), but it's definitely worth going to see."
3568,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"OK, let me get something clear. House of the Dead was ridiculous. I was so angry when Boll Butchered Bloodrayne(one of my favorite video game) and was even more angry when the sequel came out, even with the beautiful Natassia Malthe as Rayne the movie was 3 time worst than the first one that was really awful, so you imagine what I'm saying.

But here we are with this movie, honestly i rented it because i always liked these kind of movie(Troy, Dark Kingdom: The Dragon King, Tristan + Isolde) are all movies i liked. And Jason Statham was in it so it couldn't that bad. I was not expecting much because its a Uwe Boll movie.

But then i watched it and i was like...huh its really a Uwe Boll movie? I liked it, I'm not saying its my favorite movie of all time, but i really enjoy it and didn't have the impression it was a Boll movie(they always look cheap with terrible acting and poor special effect) I was greatly surprise and the only big complain i could put on it was that it was not very violent, a lot of slashing with swords etc and still not much blood sadly. But the storyline was nice, character where good, i will say it, I DID ENJOY THIS MOVIE even tough its directed by Boll. Of course it won't excuse him for these horrible Bloodrayne movie but a least he will have do one nice movie."
3569,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"I've seen a few Uwe Boll films. Most of them have only one redeeming quality: Unintentional humor.

This movie, however, was different. For the first time, I was almost impressed by the movie; not just the amount of money wasted, or the number of otherwise-decent actors inexplicably recruited into it, but the actual story and execution.

While watching, I couldn't help but feel that there was a good movie here, hidden underneath the satirically inept directing and bafflingly awkward dialogue. It's as though Uwe Boll would periodically say, ""People, the movie is coming along far too well; everyone do something stupid for a scene or two. Can't go raising everybody's expectations of me."" Despite the Uwe Boll trademarks of stilted dialogue, poor character development, and generally murky storytelling, the movie was entertaining and well-paced. Almost despite the directing, the plot had some semblance of logic, and none of the actors were particularly horrible.

Don't get me wrong; it's not a good movie by any normal criteria, and has a host of problems. The point here is that, for Uwe Boll, this is fantastically good.

With a little polish, and a better dialogue writer, this would have made a solid, entertaining high-budget B-movie, the kind that summer blockbusters and popcorn nights on the couch at home are made of."

Nevertheless I wasn't disappointed by the movie, it had action, a cheesy love story and a partially happy ending...what more can you expect? It was the same as many other action movies; it was a pain to watch, if you expected a prime movie, but that isn't what you get with an Uwe Boll movie.

Dear lord, does this movie stink. The worst thing IS the casting. Individually, all of these actors have their strengths. Liotta and Statham are superb in modern urban situations. But as, respectively, an evil wizard and a medieval FARMER!?! Really? I thought Liotta was gonna pop an aorta, he was EMOTING so hard. Burt Reynolds should never play anything but versions of his own wisecracking self, and he is cast as a king - a medieval king. Experienced character actors like Perlman and Rhys-Davies come off the best, because they can play anyone in any time period. But still, given the execrable script, even they manage to suck at times. I've never seen such tone-deaf casting and writing in my life, and remember, I've seen Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus. If you value your time and your sanity, stay FAR away from his movie.

Terrible movie, actors of the caliber of Statham, Reynolds and Liotta should be able to smell it coming a mile away. It appears that Uwe Boll (director) has his own production company. He'd certainly need to have, because any production executive with a brain in his head would quickly review this across his desk and directly into the waste bin. Uwe, if you are going to make such total rubbish please cast Gary Busey as the lead and cast his penis, which he apparently named 'Big Wednesday' as the villain. So bad, it couldn't have been worse if M Night Shyamalan had directed"
3579,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"Remember how in Dracula, they used existing classical music, which enhanced the mood and the action perfectly, so much so that hearing those themes from Swan Lake brings to mind images of Bela Lugosi?

Well, In the Name of the King seems to have not had enough budget for a proper composer, but the music very often doesn't fit in the slightest. Often it seems almost comical, such as when Farmer is saving his two mates from the river.

Unfortunately, as the score distracts, it is least present at times when it would be nice to be distracted by the poor acting. Look at the credits and you won't expect much acting, but most of the lines are delivered as if they're being read for the first time and the actors don't really know where the story is going. Sometimes it sounds like they ad lib, like saying ""What the hell does that mean?"" in such a colloquial way, just after asking with great feeling ""What games are the gods playing with me?"" and getting a response that sounds creatively zen.

The effects of course aren't special. They pale next to movies of the same era. This is all about budget of course, so I won't criticize too much. Much can be done with little, given the right eye for the look of the scenes, and these scenes stage very well, even if they look like castoffs from the Lord of the Rings prop department.

The story isn't very interesting, the acting isn't very interesting, and the filming isn't very exciting. Overall, it's only of interest to devoted fans of a.) any of the leads, just to complete the chore of watching all their respective works; b.) the fantasy-action genre in general, although this only moderately qualifies as either or c.) movies that are bad in the not- laughable way.

P.S. I find it interesting that IMDb suggests that I might also like movies with much shorter names such as Avatar, Willow and Beowulf. I guess they figure once I've read the unnecessarily long name of this movie I'd be glad for a movie I could talk about."
3580,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"This movie should have been so much better than it was considering the talent. Maybe had this been done by a better director with a much better script, this film wouldn't have been half bad. I don't really know what many of the actors in this film were doing in a Uwe Boll film. Many of them are well respectable and shouldn't have signed up to do this film (Jason Statham, Ray Liotta, Burt Reynolds, Claire Forlani, Leelee Sobieski, Ron Rerlman). In general 'In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale' is just a boring film with rip-offs from The Lord of the Rings. The characters were boring and bland, the fight scenes were bad directed, and the dialogue was just cheesy.

The film runs at a 1hr, 55mins (excl. end credits), but it feels so much longer. I was checking my watch and the clocks quite often while watching this film waiting for it to end. The film was just boring (save for some fight scenes in the forest). Another thing that you could just tell from the start that this was going to be a bad film, is that many of the actors are speaking in different accents. Some were using American accents, while others were using old English medieval accents. Bottom line, don't waste your time watching this."

3588,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"I'm going into this review with honesty- I have only seen about two-thirds of Uwe Boll's ""In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"", and I'll never finish watching it. I simply have no desire to- I kept falling asleep during my previous attempts to watch it, it was so ""blah"" and uninspired! And as he demonstrated with previous atrocities against both cinema and video-games such as ""House of the Dead"" and ""BloodRayne"", director Boll once again proves he simply doesn't have a clue.

Even with capable (and good) actors, and a fairly large budget of $60 million, he delivers a film that looks like it was made for TV, with lame CGI effects and atrocious-looking monsters and villains. There was some nice production design and a few cool costumes, but the cinematography and lighting really took away from them. Plus, I actually laughed out loud when the supposedly ferocious creatures arrived and attacked a village near the beginning- the monster suits the performers were wearing were pure ""Power Rangers""- silly rubber costumes that just make the actors look like actors in costumes and not resemble anything monstrous at all.

The plot: Something about an army of creatures that is controlled by the evil Gallian, and a Farmer who goes after Gallian after his son is killed and his wife is kidnapped by his evil forces. Yeah, something along those lines, I couldn't tell you exactly, 'cause the movie put me to sleep. Although it was nice of Boll to give me an alternative to counting sheep to help me catch some ""z's""! I should have been more suspicious when I saw the film's previews, which boasted a generic font displaying generic catch-phrases, while a generic hero delivered a generic pep-talk to generic allies.

As I mentioned above, the film has quite a talented cast, including leading man Jason Statham (of ""Transporter"" trilogy and ""Crank"" fame), Ron Perlman (""Hellboy"" series) and even Burt Reynolds (no notation needed), with supporting roles by the likes of Claire Forlani, Kristanna Loken and others. We even get Ray Liotta as the villain! In other words, the cast is great, but none of them really seems to give a darn about the film. I never had a feeling of intimacy with the characters that a viewer should feel... I just felt like I was watching people reciting lines. That's about it.

I should mention Boll's direction as well- mediocre in this film, which is actually a surprising improvement over his past few films! He still can't really tell a story visually, but mediocre is a big step from where he was before, which was ""god awful."" I suppose I could go on and on about how bad Boll's films are, but by now you should really get the picture. So I guess I'll say that while still really bad, ""In the Name of the King"" isn't Boll's worst, though it isn't his best, either. (His best, and only, decent film being the so-so drama ""Heart of America"") There are a few nice details here and there, but Boll's amateurish style and the apparent lack of charisma from anyone and everyone involved really shows through.

I really can't recommend this film. It's one of Boll's better films, but that isn't really saying much. Frankly, it's just another fantasy film trying to cash in on the success of ""Lord of the Rings"" by having big battles and lots of special effects. A 4 out of 10 for me. Avoid it unless you need something that will put you to sleep."

3590,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"If you have nothing to do on a Saturday afternoon, this is a great little DVD to pop in and laugh at. I mean, with Jason Statham (thankfully without a toupée), John Rhys-Davies (""no one tosses a dwarf), and Ron Perlman (""Hellboy"") in the cast, you would think this would be a top notch film, right? Don't count on it. I'll even give you the fact that Burt Reynolds plays the King. Good old Burt couldn't even save this one. I think the budget was spent on the cast and special effects so there was little left for a script, let alone to hire a decent director.

The special effects are pretty incredible. The battle scenes are well choreographed and the music isn't half bad but then you find scenes like the one with Kristanna Loken as Elora, a vine swinging tough chick who declares that men are not welcome in her forest and has the screen presence of a stick.

Ray Liotta gets the biggest laughs as he tries desperately to be the insane baddie. I just couldn't take him seriously and I am not sure he could, either. Maybe he needed the money? To my surprise the saving grace of this whole fiasco is Matthew Lillard (""Scream"") who shines as the sniveling, traitorous, Duke Fallow. Yes, he plays it over the top, but in a snooze fest of performances, Lillard can't help but shine."
3591,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"I have heard a lot about how Uwe Boll is the absolute worst filmmaker in the world. I have read how he deserves to never be allowed near any camera and have seen endless assault on him online and other sources. I have had no interest in watching any of his film except that this one was on and there wasn't anything else I that piqued my interest. I had expected it to be bad but I have to admit I've seen worst as a matter of fact the last movie I saw before this, ""Delta Farce"" was even worst.

The movie was supposed to be based on the video game ""Dungeon Siege"", there by itself is a clue as to where it first went wrong. For the life of me I could never understand the desire of any movie producer to make a movie based on a game. It just seem like a bad idea. It's even worse when there's no attempt to make a good movie. This film unfortunately does not even try. There seem to be an idea to just follow a story laid out already. No reason for the actions, no character development, very little background development.

The main problem with this film of course is the script. It just basically plunge us into the action without explanation. I know that the wizard or magi Galien wants to take over a kingdom and we have no explanation as to why other than it's land and that he wants it. We also have no explanation as to how he made alliances inside the kingdom just brief hints at what his allies really wants. The dialogue is cheesy and there are used of phrases and words that absolutely did not belong in a Medieval sword and sorcery film. I mean they were using modern colloquialism like ""Don't be so melodramatic"". It just doesn't work.

Also the characters are underdeveloped. They all are just one dimensional characters that basically just exist to do their deeds on this movie. They're not really characters that you think about after the movie is finished neither are they characters you could really care about. They're about as transparent as can be. There are no surprises in what they're going to do or how they're going to act. They are what they are.

The acting is mixed, the older actors at least gave it a try. John Rhys Davies has done numerous of these horrible B and C grade movies and remains professional, so has Ron Perlman. neither just recite their lines you can see in their eyes that there's something behind them. Burt Reynolds on the other hand just gave up after a few scenes, he was good in a few scenes then it seems as if he just fell asleep. Leelee Sobieski is just not a good actress neither is Matthew Lillard. Jason Statham is a martial artist and you don't expect them to be good actors, he's almost as bad as Steven Seagal. Claire Forlani and Ray Liotta did what they could and it makes you wonder how their careers can sink so low. Mr. Liotta had an auspicious beginning appearing in ""Goodfellas"" and Miss Forlani had appeared with Brad Pitt and was on her way to bigger and better things. Both could use new agents.

As for Mr. Boll's directing his camera work was not bad at all, I would have to say that some of the action sequences moved a little slower than you expect from a film like this. I don't know Mr. Boll's background I would suspect that he was a music video or television commercial director. He knows how to handle the hardware but he knows absolutely nothing about story telling or creating characters. To top it all I don't think he knows how to work with actors."
3592,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"Let me start by saying that I'm shocked Females under 18 rated it a 7.9? Based on what? Set it old England, some of the actors have English accents? I even heard (during the major fight seen at the beginning) after the arrow shot from the grey-bearded man, an ""ancient"" soldier say ""come on man, let's roll"". Hardly old English verbiage with an American accent.

One of the worst films i've ever seen. BTW: During the same fight seen, you see the star actor, a fierce fighter, sprint at full steam into a horse (face first) and fall down. Horrible.

So I came into this not expecting too much. And, truth be told, this movie is bad, but not horrible, surprisingly enough. It is genuinely enjoyable at times, in a dumb sort of way. Jason Statham is a surprisingly good fit, though Ron Perlman was merely okay, which I though was somewhat weird. I expected it to be the other way around. Most of the fight scenes are pretty cool, though the end could have been a lot better, in my opinion. There are plenty of silly little things that make no sense at all (ninjas? What?) but ultimately, everything sorta pans out into an enjoyable, stupid film. This is far from a masterpiece, but it's certainly closer than Alone in the Dark. Maybe this means Uwe Boll is growing as a director? I hope"

3597,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007),3.8,Uwe Boll,"(In)famous for his game-to-movie adaptations, Uwe Boll hasn't earned respect from games all over the world. ITNOTK is a bit better than previous movies (Bloodrayne, Alone in the Dark etc) but definitely not great.

Uwe is a strange dude. Despite the fact that I think he's a straight forward guy and I like his attitude ('I like what I do and earn my living so blow me'), he misses some important things to be taken more seriously:

I just don't get it. How does Uwe Bolls keep getting these actors in his movies. While Christian Slater, Ben Kingsley and Michael Madsen have featured in his previous movies, ITNOTK has the following cast:

Jason Statham as the London bloke trapped in a fantasy world, Burt Reynolds as the US Sean Connery clone as in The First Knight, Ron 'Hellboy' Perlman... well, doing his cool Ron Perlman thing, Ray Liotta in a ... Ray-Las-Vegas-Liotta-magician kinda role, with corresponding haircut, Matt 'Shaggy' Lillard as the kings retarded nephew, and hottie Claire Forlani as the MILF

So that's the lineup... impressive huh? So what about the movie?

Well, the monsters were a bit crappy, the backgrounds and environments looked pretty good, 3d effects were decent, but nothing we haven't seen before. Too bad you can't say the same about the screenplay... what a mess.

The story is very choppy, too many scenes in the movie were completely useless. Over-dramatic acting with the wrong actors make it very unbalanced and unbelievable. The correct timing could have make this movie a lot better.

The action scenes are terrible: it's clear that every scene is built up of 40 shots pasted together. It's like they're not even trying to fit the shots seamlessly. off course Jason Statham and Ron Perlman can kick some serious ass, but the mix of martial arts and swordplay make it too modern.

The thing that bugged me the most were the mix of American English and UK English and ... the Ninjas.

Did you just say Ninjas? Yes, Ninjas my friend... What has Uwe been smoking when he thought of that?

All together, the movie was fun to watch but could have been a lot better. My wife didn't complain about the movie so I guess this one was about the same level as The Bold and the Beautiful or As the World Turns ;)"

3600,Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018),3.8,Steven C. Miller,"I was a little bit worried when I learned that it will skip a theatrical release, but still looked forward to it. I really liked the first one and thought that the cast in this one was decent. Sadly, almost nothing about it works.

The script is disastrously bad. The plot and pace are all over the place, making an 85 minute movie feel long. The cinematography is horrendous. The movie is filled with neon lights that are almost headache inducing. The fight scenes are banal and are there just for the sake of it.There are Sci-Fi elements that serve little purpose and don't really fit. Oh, and Stallone and Batista are secondary characters. This would not be a problem if the leads were interesting, charismatic or well written, but they unfortunately are none of those things.

I enjoy B movies. For me, everything can be forgiven if the movie is fun. But this is just boring."
3601,Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018),3.8,Steven C. Miller,"The acting is mediocre at best. The cinematography is just terrible. most of the movie is filmed with a handheld camera and the cameraman has parkinsons. Imdb has not listed any budget for this movie and that is because there is no budget. CGI is awful, explosions and gunfire is so fake that there are no words to describe how bad it is. There is one cool scene and that is the barfight. Other than that there is nothing good about this movie. One of the worst sequels in history."
3602,Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018),3.8,Steven C. Miller,"I very much enjoyed the original movie and so was looking forward to seeing this. I watch about 30 minutes before I just stopped. Plot jumps all over the place and there is zero flow to the movie. You have no interest in the characters and the whole feel is just hollow and pointless.

Do yourself a favor and spend the 30 minutes I wasted doing something else."
3603,Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018),3.8,Steven C. Miller,"SPOILER: I really enjoyed Escape Plan. It was fun and although a little silly it was well put together well directed. Now I was surprised to see Stallone doing back to back sequels in Escape Plan 2 + 3, but if 2 is anything to go by then Stallone has slipped horribly into Straight-to-Video Hell! Which is quite apt as that's what Hades means (it was the Greek name for the underworld).

So why is it so bad? - Well, firstly we start the film with characters (and actors) we've never seen before: A team on some kind of rescue mission from terrorists. Wait, what?! We don't see Stallone until 10 mins into the film. It's his team. He's the boss of a security firm in Atlanta now. But he's not the main character. Oh.

The main character is Chinese actor Xiaoming Huang. No, I've never heard of him before either. Don't get me wrong, I have no doubt this actor is a big star in China. His martial arts are really good, and he has a certain presence about him. But his character here is so underwritten that you never engage with him as a character. So instead of being invested in him, you become a mere spectator of what happens to him. I'm sure Chinese money & market has a major part in his casting, but this isn't how to do it. Also featured is Cheng Tang, who (I'm sorry), is almost unintelligible in around half his scenes. But I think it's partly the director's fault. We frequently can't see him speaking as the camera is doing something strange. So you get a difficult to understand accent from a disembodied voice.

So, Huang finds himself inside a new mega high-tech prison, where to achieve privileges you have to to win fights in a gladiatorial fight - for no apparent reason. Oh. This is such an old B-Movie cliché that I can't believe they went there, but I suppose they wanted to make use of Huang's martial arts and this is how they do it. It's a bit desperate though. Meanwhile, on the outside Stallone recruits Bautista to help find Huang and another team member who's gone missing. At this point you think this might pick up, but you'd be wrong.

The problem is that none of this is joined up well. You frequently are barely comprehending what is supposed to be going on. There's no real focus to the film as we cut back and forth between outside and inside the prison - which nobody knows the location of. Dialogue is frequently missed or mumbled, especially by 50 Cent, who is so bad I think they could have employed a cardboard cut-out with a robot voice and it would have been a) more intelligible and b) a better performance. Seriously, why do people keep employing him? Bautista is underused, and is just a man mountain who terms up and does things. There's no character. He's just a thing that does stuff.

Stallone, obviously is trying to spin-off successful films in which he was the action hero. Now older, he can't do that stuff anymore, however, when he does a little bit of action you can't help but be impressed. Here there's a good action scene in which he and Bautista waste numerous assassins, but I really don't know what that scene was about. It just seemed to be stuffed in there for a bit of action. Another scene is a bit silly really, where he faces a man at least 30 years younger than him in fisticuffs. Dude! You're in your 70's! Stop it! It's getting embarrassing now.

The special effects in the film are grossly overdone but so low grade that you wonder how they managed to use 90's technology and make them look 80's, and the prison never feels like anything but a rather bad film set. The whole film looks rather B-Movie cheap.

Although the script doesn't work for all the reasons I've given above, I reserve special mention for the director, Stephen C Miller, who seems to think that erratic and inappropriate camera movements is what directing means. This film could have been watchable if Miller was not at the helm. He's dire! It's like an 8-year-old was given a camera kit and tracks. This isn't style, it's mess. Nothing about his direction works. Nothing. No thing. In all seriousness, Miller has killed what might have been just a bad film and made it a very bad film indeed. Producers! Stop employing him! He has no idea what he's doing! Nothing he does works!

Please, Stallone, you are better than this. You can write really good characters and you are actually a good actor. Do some thrillers. Act your age, dude. As for Escape Plan 3: Devil's Station, at least it won't have Miller directing. John Herzfeld at least knows how to use a camera."
3604,Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018),3.8,Steven C. Miller,"What an awful movie this is, I cannot believe this movie hits the theaters. It is clearly a B-movie, very cheap CGI, the acting is poor and the story? Take a stack of cards, throw it in the air, there's your story. I knew this movie would suck but I did not expect it would be that bad. It is full with plot holes, if you see this movie, question marks will be floating above your head during the whole movie. A lot of viewers will leave their seats and some might ask their money back."
3605,Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018),3.8,Steven C. Miller,"Let's be brief. All of the fighting / action scenes are shaky cam nonsense. 95% of the dialogue is expositional. The direction seems very basic.

this movie was so bad and the actors couldn't talk properly, the acting was so wooden and forced, the movie CGI was cheap and nasty and its been done before a 1000 times better too. the first film was a good movie with a convincing villain and the story worked, this one there is no story and to really take the p*** Stallone is in this film for about 10 mins tops and even 50 Cent looked bored.

It blends suspense , thrills, action , twists and turns . it is believed that no one can ever flee from impregnable prison , except for a daring man , Ray Breslín : a senile Silvester Stallone . As he manages an elite team of security specialists trained in the art of breaking people out of the most impenetrable prisons . Years after he fought his way out of an inescapable prison , Ray has organized a new awesome security force formed by brave members played by Dave Bautista , Xiamong Huang , Jesse Metcalf . And his usual colleague , the resourceful technology expert Shu Ren : 50 Cent Jackson , as well as his sweet companion Abigail : Jaime King .But one of his team members goes missing , as he is kidnapped and disappears inside the most elaborate jail ever built : ¨Hades¨ , entirely computerized by a huge super computer called Galileo and ordinarily changing its shape , then Breslín has to return to the hell he once escaped from . As a decrepit Ray must track him down with the help of his former colleagues , infiltrating himself into a futuristic facility with extreme security measures . This is not a prison , it is a Machine . He's back.

This thrilling flick packs intrigue , nail-biting violence and lots of fights . The movie takes place into four walks of a high technology jail with plenty of computers and glimmer lights . Of course , expired Stallone is also locked and equally determinated to get his freedom, using his special skills to break out , as he goes on to push the boundaries of what is human possible , dealing with his preparatives and fights to escape by confronting nasty enemies . Sylvester Stallone plays in his ordinary , but already out-of-date , style as the obstinate hero to get the wished escape .The final confrontation between Stallone supported by his underlings and the baddies is stimulating and violent , including some surprises . In the film shows up some actors from previous installment as 5o Cent Jackson , and Stallone himself , adding others as Xiamong Huang , Dave Bautista, Wes Chatham , Titus Welliver and Jaime King who replaced Amy Ryan as Abigail .The motion picture was badly directed by Steven C Miller and was filmed in 20 days only , and several countries was exhibited direct to video . Steve C Miller is an expert on action and terror movies , usually played by famous actors , but with no much success , such as : Line of duty , First kill, Arsenal, Marauders , Submerged , Extraction , Under the bed , The agression Scale, Scream of the Banshee , Automaton transfusion , among others. Rating 3.5/10. Only for Sylvester Stallone's hardcore fans .

This Escape plan trilogy is formed by the first , original and the best : ¨Escape plan¨ 2013 by Mikael Hafstrom with James Cazievel , Arnold Schwarzenegger, 50 cent Jackson , Amy Ryan , Vinnie Jones ; in which Stallone finds himself set up and incarcerated in the world's most secret and secure prison, ¨The Tomb¨ -a highly fortified prison based on his own design- and he must use his skills to escape with help from the inside . Following a third outing titled ¨The extractors¨ 2019 by John Herzfeld with 50 Cent , Jaime King , Sea Bruckner , Russell Wong , Daniel Bernhardt, this latter concerns a rescue of the abducted daughter of a Hong Kong mogul from a formidable Latvian prison,, then Breslin's girlfriend is also kidnapped."

Why was this movie made? What is wrong with this movie? Boring as hell, A lot of CGI, shaky cam, horrible dialogue, horrible acting, terrible music sound, Stallone isn't even in this movie.

The plot makes no sense. This movie is more a sci-fi film, it has no action. The plot is pointless. Horrible shaky cam jumps up and down. When Stallone fights on the end, that is his stunt double. Stallone is far too old to fight with a younger guy. What the hell Stallone? Why did he went to make this movie? Did he do it only for the money? In this movie Stallone isn't much in it! His character Ray Breslin is useless, he does nothing. Sly is old and his character is old fat sack! Sly even him self is disappointed, I am dissappointed Sly. Hades might boast some decent star power, but there isn't a celebrity in the world who could save this bargain bin nonsense from feeling like a bootlegged ripoff of its own franchise.

3636,Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018),3.8,Steven C. Miller,"Ray Breslin and his crew are back. Same three basics needs remain in play: 1) Layout; 2) Routine and 3) Help from either inside or out. This time, members of his crew are captured for no apparent reasons, initially.

Captured from around the world and sent to an undisclosed location, Hades is said to basically be version 2.0 of The Tomb (see the original). This time, instead of hosting some of the world's worst criminals, Hades is holding prisoners for ransom. Each, in some way, has access to either high level world security details, Fortune 500 companies, etc.

With a running time of 93 minutes, the first two thirds moves rapidly; with back and forth cut scenes of inside and outside of Hades walking through both the plot and the plan of escape, including heavy action. Where ironically, during the climax of the movie, it moved too fast and didn't allow some of the scenes to develop. Overall, a good movie with a few surprises right up to the very end.

3638,Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018),3.8,Steven C. Miller,"I like Stallone, he might be too old for fight scenes and stunts(or should be, who knows how he manages these days?!) but he is one of my all time greats and I am glad he still does movies. So you would think I went in expecting to see Stallone. I was wrong. A team needs a setup, I do not care about any of the characters. The lead Asian man was a nice surprise since I love martial arts movies but his character is like a walking cliche. He does martial arts, meditates etc. It feels shoehorned in to give him weight. His martial arts seem good but that leads me me to the main problem I have with this movie: they cannot keep the camera still at all. Why, oh why is it so hard to keep the camera still? Put the damn thing on a table, the constant movement(AWAY FROM THE ACTION) does not help, it ruins the coreography which seems good, just that I can't see any of it because the damn camera moves so much all over the place. I apologise for cursing but I honestly was really looking forward to this movie, being a Stallone fan but this movie I cannot recommend in any way shape or form. Stick to the first "

3640,Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018),3.8,Steven C. Miller,"This is a very descent film. Maybe the CGI is cheesy and the acting a bit wooden. But it does offer a deeper meaning. In our time and age is very hard to judge a film by the quality of CGI. But that is the whole point. It doesnt really matter. Noone has ever chewed on the wrapper instead of the chocolate bar.

It would be fair to say the CGI is bad and everything else is bad too. But this is not the case. And it is an error to snowball this film by taking account of the CGI.

Lets examine this case in reverse. What if the same film frame by frame had an astonishing expensive super impressive CGI ? You would not be able to see past that. The meaning of this film would be hidden under so many layers of heavy CGI that you would not be able to see the meaning.

The cheap CGI releases the ability of the viewer to receive the meaning of this film. It makes it easier to see past the effects curtain and see what is on the other side. Stallone knows this. He is an extremely experienced actor and film maker, he might not be a Stanley Kubrick but in this case I think the cheap CGI was meant to be cheap from the start. I think it was a wise choice to do so by Stallone.

And that is why we are going to get another escape plan."

Well, this movie was much better than I expected Most of the news I had heard was starting to make this movie would be poor, but it's far from poor I enjoyed it much more than I expected to Sure it's low budget but Sly is in most of the movie, Batista isn't really on the movie at all, even his action scene was very short, he's gets a total screen time of under 10 minutes Which brings me to the action, lots and lots of it, great fight scenes and although the action is low budget it is very satisfying Slys presence in the movie gives him the right to have top billing, no he's not the protagonist of the movie that role is the Chinese character (who was also very good btw) but Slys character Breslin is great and Sly makes a lot of his time on screen

There are direct references of the first movie and references to characters in that movie, they have made an effort to link the movies together and did a good job

There are a couple of excellent Saw esque twists in the movie which of them the twist half way through the movie was excellent I was very pleasantly surprised

The music throughout I really enjoyed and gives the movie a great deal of tension

There was a scene at the end which is clearly added for one reason and that is to give Sly a fight scene, I didn't think the movie needed it but it's there anyway and most Sly fans will like it

The ending is a good open book for the third movie and after watching I think you like myself will be looking forward to the 3rd movie as it ends with a decent little cliffhanger (no pun inteded)

Overall I think the people who are not aware of this movie who pick it up because Sly is on the cover will definitely not be disappointed I also think because of the low expectations on this forum most of you will also be pleasantly surprised at how entertaining the movie is

The prison while a little over the top (no pun) is interesting enough to hold your attention, and this new prison is directly linked to the prison in the first movie

To finish I give the movie 4/10, it is low budget, some characters don't really have much development and some of the tech stories can be a little confusing, never the less it's an enjoyable movie, Sly is great and has his trademark voice and confident attitude, the links to the first movie make a good follow up to the original and I am certainly looking forward to Part III"

But this still has Stallone it's still great and having Dave Bautista it's great to have him in movie i enjoyed him he kicks ass in movie he is very entering to watch in movie, and i didn't expect Sequels for Escape Plan but i saw this i am like what ? really did Stallone escape already ? how many times is Stallone is going to get out of prison ? but anyway for me i liked sequel it's a lot of fun it's VERY Slaright Forward Action, i really understand people got pissed off Escape Plan 2 i understand it but i saw movie i enjoyed it everyone got different opinion of opinion but just because Critics say this is crap just watch movie then at end of day you make choice it's not really bad as what you think of Critics write. now i had a lot of fun with this movie. i knew what was i getting into what it was a direct to DVD sequel of Escape Plan i was ok some people say oh this is REALLY BAD BAD i am like ok at end of day i enjoyed it so far it's just fun, good fun time to watch movie i would not say it's time waster i would say it's a lot fun. it's not as bad what everyone says. i had fun Stallone was their kicking ass a lot of action in movie so as Baustia i didn't like movie just for Stallone and Baustia it was just a lot fun very slaright forward action flick. the action was a lot of fun the script is maybe not the best but it's not silly script or dumb the script is good, it's a lot of fun action in film a lot of it, i rather say it's more quicker then first Escape Plan because first had a lot of action and Schwarzenegger nailed his role but in this movie it's a lot fun, very slaright forward then the first Escape Plan movie just moves on i think it's bit too short for people who wants more of sequel. i really wished this was not a direct to DVD film because this was directed buy Steven C Miller he made a lot of bad, bad, bad movies not this movie, this movie is good a lot of fun but he did kinda ruined Sequel for another people i liked movie all movies Steven C Miller made i liked Is Just Escape Plan 2 and Extraction the rest of movies he did crappy Bruce Willis movies was First Kill, Marauders, Nicholas Cage film Arsenal bad films but this in my opinion sequel of Escape Plan is good but i wish it wasn't direct to DVD film. Plot follows Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) is now manages an elite team of security specialists trained in the art of breaking people out of the world's most impenetrable prisons. nothing after events from First Escape Plan nothing about Schwarzenegger character, you have new Asian character with talented Martial Arts Shu (huang xiaoming) know for IP Man 2, but rest of his movies he made is just Asian movies not well known for everything i wished it could be Donnie yen or Tony Jaa but Huang Xiaoming is eh nothing special about his acting but he wasn't annoying character he is a jail breaker as well, When his trusted operative, Shu Ren, is kidnapped and disappears inside the most elaborate prison ever built, now with prison isn't very huge like in first movie i wished it could be big Exactly like that but the prison is big but it's all feels like the film was set in an abandoned Laser Quest building. but not as what you think watch movie then you know what i mean. Ray assembles an elite team to assist in the rescue Shu in prison, i love Action scene in movie Trent Derosa (Dave Baustia) Guardians of Galaxy, Kickboxer: Vengeance, House of Rising Sun, Man with iron fist. is in this movie as second role of movie he is in it his their and their he is i can't say his not much but he is their kicking ass in scene i love in bar when Stallone and Basutia both kickass to kill couple bad guys. villains are aren't so good i thought villains sucked lame villain in movie Gregor Faust (Titus Welliver) known for Lost TV Show, Sons of Anarchy, Town, Argo, Man on Ledge he has been few movies, he is called ZOO keeper keeping his Prisoners like Animals in prison, and he isn't good villain he is not enjoyable not really good villain just nothing i really wished they could hired another actor as villain maybe could hired Johnny Messner or Daniel Bernhardt as villain lead villain have someone kickass with Stallone, elite team Luke (jesse metcalfe) known for Dallas, John Tucker Must Die, i am like ok i am not fan of that actor but he is bit wooden could hired Victor Ortiz could worked again each another like Expendables 3 but Jesse Metcalfe is eh he didn't suit in this movie, Abigail (Jamie King) is good, Curtis ''50 Cent'' Jackson Hush from first Escape Plan. team was ok not best but could Hired MMA Stars reason for Action film, UFC Fighter was in it not to much Tyron Woodley not much in movie only fights with Shu that's it.

Stallone Acting is good he looks like he is enjoying it not like in Reach Me where he looks beyond tired, and he's really slumming it in the first two acts, Stallone is good in movie.

the things i hated about this The effects are awful, the bad guy has an awful ulterior motive for his actions. he is very wooden, effects and CGI i am like god why did Steven C Miller directed this i mean he is not best to hire he is not best writer i would eh say he did ok with this movie it's fun slaright forward action film Stallone and Baustia for sure but Steven C Miller is bad director movie needs different director like Isaac Florentine he would have done this movie better or i wished Stallone could written the sequels all of it he is director he hasn't directed movie since Expendables (2010) Stallone could make things a lot and a lot better then to Steven C MIller can't direct for crap i liked movie but it doesn't block me to hate over for director. Stallone has not been more hands on -or more passionate about any other projects he has been involved in. Its pure octane, its fight after fight, guns slinging, hard knocking flick headlined by Stallone in top form. Its not my favorite Stallone film and Basutia film but movie is eh good movie, a good pacing film it didn't suck. still disgusted at the CGI, It could have been better. it has a great twist in middle of movie, 8.10 love action scenes a lot of fun, Stallone and Baustia Rocked in movie it's great and it's fun but hey it's not best but still a lot fun it's worth for your time, it's good to see Sequel it's not bad like what Critics Say how it is, like i said in end of day it's your choice, don't trust Critics it's wrong, it's your choice if you liked movie or not. some characters don't really have much development and some of the tech stories can be a little confusing, never the less it's an enjoyable movie, Sly is great and has his trademark voice and confident attitude, the links to the first movie make a good follow up to the original and I am certainly looking forward to Escape Plan 3 Devils Station."

Even so, the quality of the film a little left behind. The scenes where people from Hades are shooting are the worst. The way how bullets are coming out doesn't seem like real. So, I'd say it's kind of low quality film for a start.

The film itself doesn't seem like long. I can catch everything of the previous film. But this one, I don't understand a lot of things. Maybe it's just because of some people said the script has a problem. But still, it's enjoyable for one time watch.

So, after Shu accepts to bodyguard his cousin Yusheng, they both end up in Hades, a futuristic prison. Why? Because Yusheng holds some info over some satellites that can control pretty much any computer in the world. Geez... So it's up to Breslin and his troop to help them out.

It's all too painful to watch. They get beat up every single day and, yet, they are walking just fine with some bruises. Are they Wolverine or something!? And the CGI, wow...

One other thing I don't get it is why all this old action actors get to always make movies with some sort of ""coach"" teachings!? ""Family is all"", ""stay humble"", ""you need to be patient"", ""trust your instints"", yada-yada...

The soldiers aren't believable, any rook with basic training can see that they're handling themselves poorly at best, with regards to handling weapons, tacticts, communication and more. And most annoying of all is that the audience is being treated as idiots, by having chinese people speak english to one another, which makes NO sense and ruins what little immersion there is, making ou have to ""re-set"" when the patronizing whitewash finally ends. If you manage to get past that, there's decent hand to hand fight scenes, but apart from that, most of the action is pure scifi, again, ruining immersion. I like most of Stallone's movies including the prequel to this shlock, and Batista has become one of my favorite actors,and I DID enjoy the scenes with the two together, but that doesn't rescue this accident of a movie, because the plot is all over the place, the cinematography is bad and so is the editing, and did I mention CHINESE PEOPLE SPEAKING ELNGLISH TO EACH OTHER..?

Anyway...

I can see how it might seem poor in comparison to the first one and you can see how they're tried to step it up a notch but the script and direction definitely need some attention.

Firstly, what genre does it actually think it is? Gritty espionage movie, contemporary high tech thriller, sci-fi, Kung Fu? It undermines your perceptions at every opportunity. Actually,, what decade is it supposed to be? With its contemporary 2018 setting soon becoming a garish abundance of neon, and a plinky plonky 80's electronic soundtrack.

Yes, there's a bit of an 1980's revival since the wonderful 80's themed Strange Days, but to me, instead of accomplishing that feeling of being returned to those wondrous days of youth, it's was more like being dragged back to my parents first divorce. What about the plot I hear you cry? The plot holes make Swiss cheese look like that big lump of mature cheddar that has sat at the back of the fridge since before you can remember, but you don't have the heart to throw out.

While sitting watching this film I actually figured out why this was called escape plan, why? Because honestly while watching this I was making up my own escape plan how I would escape from this.

I've used an AA rating recently to describe another atrocious film and now I'm afraid to say I'm going to use the AA rating again.

This film is absolutely atrocious!

I literally wasted, no hang on I'm being cruel because this film did have 1 redeeming thing, the end titles.

This is actually more sci-fi than a thriller or action movie and the marital arts fight sequences are great to watch but other than this it's one to avoid.

Don't waste your money or time and if it is ever shown on TV, do anything to avoid this.

Rating 3 out of 10"
3732,Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018),3.8,Steven C. Miller,"In the first couple of minutes of this movie you can tell how much effort were willing to put into it. The bullet special effects are ridiculous; like something you would see in a very low budget television show, and there is even a part where someone (I seriously can't remember a single persons name from this movie) gets electrocuted and I actually laughed when I saw the special effects for the electricity. There is simply no excuse for how poor the effects are, I really want to stress that because it's freaking 2018 for crying out loud. CGI should be practically indistinguishable from reality at this point in time. However, what we get instead is a complete backwards tumble to CGI from the year 2000.

But enough about the effects. Let's talk about the movie itself. The entire thing is expositional. Each scene exists in a linear fashion and serves no other purpose than to terribly propel the plot. There is no downtime for character progression. There is no progression. There is just ""I guess we need to put a scene here, so let's just regurgitate the first thing that comes to our mind."" Half this movie is over before you even realize it. It's like a machine gun firing on full auto in terms of how fast the scenes are presented to the viewer. It's almost like the creators wanted the scenes to go by quickly just to keep people from noticing how crappy the story is-or keep them from realizing there is no story. ""These people need to fight each other for REASONS, why? Shut your mouth and give us your money!

Look, I enjoyed the first movie. I thought it was actually a decent film. However, I really don't know what the hell happened in this. I even jokingly predicted that the next movie was going to be in Outer Space, and apparently that actually turned out to be true, because it's already in development. That's not a good thing. I shouldn't be able to jokingly predict your next move, while thinking of the stupidest idea that I possibly can. The fact that I was correct about it, is just an insult to your intelligence as writers and directors.

Giving this a 1/10 and no that's not at all harsh. This movie should not exist. And until someone can explain to me why it does exist, my rating will stay at a 1."
3733,Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018),3.8,Steven C. Miller,"The only thing I thought about watching this movie was how much Stallone's diction has improved. He must have spent a lot of time working with a voice coach to improve so greatly over the years. His diction was great, his acting was horrible, the only thing I can think of is that maybe at his age and as hard as he's been on his body that he might have terrible arthritis and he's in a lot of pain. I sure felt his pain watching this movie.

I liked the original Escape Plan, it was an interesting story. This was not interesting, It didn't really have a story although there was an attempt to teach a moral lesson. None of the actors were memorable, the dialogue was totally forgettable as well. I just felt pity for Stallone, he looked so old and he's still trying to do action pics well past his prime. He kind of reminds me of Brett Favre neither one of them could face the fact that their glory days are behind them and instead of staying out of the spotlight they crave just 1 more score. I don't understand it, if you have the money why not retire when you're on top and let your legend speak for you? It's crap like this that tarnishes what you used to be.

If you're a big Stallone fan and you feel like you have to see this movie, wait a month it will be on Netflix. I promise you're going to be disappointed."

Alot of people seriously think this movie is worse than the worst of Steven Seagal movies ? Let me put it straight; its not ! Im a long time Sylvester Stallone fan and I loved the first Escape Plan (2013). I waited a long time to watch this movie because I heard its supposed to be the worst movie in movie history. But now that I have watched ut...twice...I must say that I was actually pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed it. Yes, its made on a low budget. But they made the most out of the bucks...it looks ok for the most part (minus a terrible cgi explosion in the beginning wtf). They made the top secret prison facility look really cool...loved the robot. Think Running man ! Actually the stylish look of the movie and the very, very cool (!) retro 80's synth score makes this a fun and cool B-movie experience. The style, score and overall atmosphere reminds me somewhat of Beyond the black rainbow (something I never expected of a Sly movie). I was even surprised Sly had as much screentime as he did...he was a major part of the movie, eventhough not as much as in the original. I must admit he does come across as a little tired and uninterested...he does seem to phone it in little, probably not the most exciting project he was ever part of. But he is a professional and delivers ok. The story, characters and the flow of the story...could have been better for sure.

Escape artist Ray Breslin (Stallone) has taken a step down from field work choosing to teach new recruits his techniques. It follows Ray Breslin's protege who is imprisoned in a high tech prison run by robots. They are forced to fight each other in a Mortal Kombat style dojo in order to gain rations.

It's full of stupid moments that makes the first film look like a masterpiece. It repeats a lot things from that film from a set-up fight used as a distraction to a poorly conceived twist reveal towards the end. The digital effects look shoddy as if they were made using an iTunes app and the editing is wonky in places. It rips off films like Tron Legacy and The Hunger Games making it feel like a cheap looking parody.

The film is let down by a lame set up, predictable plot, bland characters and lazy writing. Don't let the film mislead you into thinking this is a Stallone/Bautista actioner as they are only in it for about 15 minutes. Instead it focuses on unknown actors who are not very good at acting (which is most likely because they used to be MMA fighters). The director does an okay job directing some of the action scenes, some of them are well choreographed however they suffer from the dreaded shaky-cam where we can barely see what is going on.

The film could have been a lot better if it was backed by a proper production company. It just looks cheaply produced as if it was made by a bunch of incompetent film students. It's let down by a bad story, a slow pace and lack of character development. In the end it's a loud, dumb fun guilty pleasure that (thankfully) runs at 90 minutes."

3741,Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018),3.8,Steven C. Miller,"There's not much to be said here. This is a straight up money grab, though I'm not sure whose money they are actually grabbing. Not mine.

Anything you remember from the original you might as well toss out the window. This movie is as B-level as you get, possibly C. Remember those direct to DVD Steven Seagal movies? This one is right up those trash buckets' alley. Stallone and ""The Animal"" Dave Bautista have secondary roles at best. If I had to count, I'd say Dave utters, maybe, 8-9 lines the entire movie, none of which are interesting or memorable. The movie itself is so ridiculous, illogical, and scattered. There's no substantial plot, no real point to what little plot exists beyond that unsubstantial mess, and anything remaining is as cheap and low-grade as you get. The entire movie is full of throwaway characters. When you do watch this, just count on six hands how many characters are in the movie yet have no actual point what so ever. For fun, I'll give you a quick start:



You could even argue 50 Cent, but I guess he does have a purpose in the film, and at leas this character contributes something, even as ridiculous as it is.

Apparently this Hades prison has no ability to stop wave-based signals either, for 2-way audio communication works just fine in this electrified floor setting. Really, the entire prison is a joke. It's security, its layout, its prisoners, the way its ran, the way the prisoners work ... none of it has any thought behind outside a couple of screen writers who drew the story out on a napkin over lunch. It is that shallow.

Let's not even talk about the abysmmal ""shakey-cam"" all of these trash A-C level action movies have started abusing for the past 15 years. Or the lack of direction. Or the awful script. The poor dialogue. The vacant acting. The amateur cinematography...

There is no redeeming qualities to this movie--at all. You will watch it, you will (maybe) finish it. Subsequently, immediately, you will forget it after giving it a bad review, then proceed to delete it from your hard drive.

AWFUL."
3742,Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018),3.8,Steven C. Miller,"I'm giving this a 10 not because I think it's really a 10, but to help offset some of the very low reviews. I think this is more of a 6-8, but not as bad as many have stated. 15 minutes in I was thinking, what the heck am I watching. This is not at all like the first escape plan, in fact Stalone plays a minor role at least initially, so much so, that I was feeling this was just a way for the studio to make a quick buck off of the first escape plan and billing it as another Stalone movie. Even the opening scene is much more gritty than the first, almost like Zero dark thirty. I started thinking maybe they are trying to go for a higher caliber setup, but then seemed to fissile for a bit. However if you sit through it, it's more of a chess game. Sure there are plenty of plot holes and if you blink things can get confusing, however, the acting is pretty good and the overall plot and twists are enough to carry it through. Overall I ended up enjoying the movie and getting into it much more than I expected from the opening. The ending is a layup for another movie, which I immediately suspected would not happen as I know many will not like this movie at all. However, I an see on IMDB that #3 is already in the works and yes I will plan to see it, albeit maybe when it's on video, guess we'll see."

But this so-called jail break ""Escape Plan"" trying so hard to become a franchise series like what Steven Segal did in his awfully bad East Europe adventures, hiring so many bad B-movie and C-level non-talent actors, the Chinese who banked and almost bought up 1/3 of Hollywood studios, it sure is on the right track to churn out the 3rd one immediately after this 2nd sequel. I really don't know what future this franchise would survive, no matter how many MMA or WWE fighters they'd recruit to play those ridiculous roles. Now Sil's hairline and hairdo are exactly the same as what we saw on Seagal's head, all spiked up and looked like what we saw dome on the heads of those guys in the Japanese samurai movies. This film, according to imdb.com was finished in 20 days, it's a rush job, but what I'm more interested is how many days its screenplay was drafted, certainly would be even shorter?

But here we are, not only with a sequel, but with third part already in the can (can't understand anyone being exited for it after this huge mess). I liked the fist movie, but when it was announced that Arnold was not coming back for this one I knew something wasn´t right. Then they announced Steven C. Miller was directing and my worst fears became true. Escape Plan 2 is nothing more (and surprisingly a lot less) than another of those cash grab direct-to-dvd sequels that has little of what made the original great (or in this case, at least an entertaining action/adventure throwback with two of the greatest movie stars of the 80s and 90s). It's boring, poorly acted and even laughable at parts, but certainly not enough to enjoy it as a guilty pleasure. I would say this is the worst movie Stallone has ever done, but Sly is barely in it. And even when he is on the screen, he isn´t. It looks like he didn't care, and I can't blame him, even the one-liners he deliver are bad.

3759,Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018),3.8,Steven C. Miller,"Whereas the first ""Escape Plan"" movie was no stroke of brilliance it actually might just have been in comparison to the rubbish that is ""Escape Plan 2: Hades"".

Wow, talk about a ridiculous storyline if there ever was one! This is the sort of sequel that should never have seen the light of day and it is unfathomable of how something as abysmal such as this came into existence.

Poorly written storyline and script, and the acting performances in the movie, despite there being some well enough action stars here, was just questionable. It was as if the actors themselves didn't even buy into the storyline. This was definitely not one of the brightest moments in Sylvester Stallone's acting career.

There is a lot of action and fighting in the movie which is the one and only thing the movie has working for it.

If you are going to watch an ""Escape Plan"" movie, stick with the first one and give the sequel a wide berth..."
3760,Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018),3.8,Steven C. Miller,"I think the main reason this movie ended out underwhelming is that Stalone and Batista have secondary roles at best. It's not easy to compete with the pair Stalone + Arnold especially when the cast does not include big or established names outside of them. Main characters feel shallow, the prison is too futuristic and the mechanisms feel too complex and not like a prison at all as it's more about the Arena than the cells and the system itself. The flow is kind of confusing for the viewer and the plot is not deep at all. It's good that the movie is 1 and a half hour long. Action movies usually should not be more more than 100'. The fighting scenes are okay and enjoyable for the casual fan. Some of the dialogue and the escape sequences can be considered fun.

✍ It's a decent movie at best, but watchable nevertheless. You might enjoy it yet not get filled by enthusiasm, every film needs the proper expectations. If this one did not act like a clickbait with the major names being promoted, maybe it would have done better because the hype hurted it but it's not that bad after all. Just nothing special. 5.5/10"
3761,Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018),3.8,Steven C. Miller,"Although that isn't saying an awful lot. Despite its very interesting premise the first film was very silly on occasion and made Arny and Sly look their age (unlike the Expendables franchise). We do get a new action star, in Xiaoming Huang, and the concept of the inescapable prison is taken further, although the criterion for who should be locked up is decidedly shaky. But that's always the rub with prisons isn't it. Perhaps it's time for a prison movie that actually questions the logic of keeping criminals in free board and accommodation (and increasingly generous facilities) while the taxpayers who are covering those costs have to work hard to obtain the same things. Surely there has to be some cost/benefit analysis so it doesn't become incarceration just for the sake of keeping criminals away from soci"

3765,Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018),3.8,Steven C. Miller,"I watched it with my 12 year old son last night.

I wasn't let down, as I knew it would be bad!! It's easily Stallones worst movie since Avenung Angelo. My son called the movies big twist 10 minutes in, laughed at the cgi, and pointed out his body double at every opportunity.

Here are a few of his thoughts as we watched it ""Does it want anymore studio logos?? Oh there's another one"" How fake does that bruise look?? ""Did he just throw his cigarette at him??"" How fake was that explosion 10 mins in. He calls the movies big twist. ""Hahaha the zoo keeper!! Bit lame to call yourself the zoo keeper!!"" ""Oh my god he is such a bad actor!!"" He was referring to the main guys cousin!! ""That Chef is awful too!!"" Big fake laugh and eye roll at the ""It's bad to be back"" line The twist happens ""Oooh I was right!! Didn't see that coming!!"" Oh god HE is gonna fight the old man!! ""Let me guess that's what number 3 (which he didn't know there was) will be about"" He pulled a puzzled expression as the movie ended, as it's abrupt. Before saying ""What a great movie that was"" full of sarcasm.

He did like the main character's fight scenes!! Although I didn't, as it was mostly shaky cam and the quick cut that I hate!!

For my own amusement, I timed his screen time. He has 19 minutes 56 seconds (not counting his voice over) It seems like he is hardly in the movie during the first half, and then is in it a lot during the last half hour!! but in truth he has only slightly more in the last half hour, in the opening hour he is onscreen for just under 10 minutes, with the remaining 10 minutes coming in the lat half hour, but they use what they have well, and it seems like he is in it, a lot more than he actually is."

Doesn't deserve all the hate from the dumb people who can't follow 
3782,Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018),3.8,Steven C. Miller,"I never saw the first film, ""Escape Plan"", and only saw the sequel because it's apparently awful. How do I know this? It has made its way onto IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List--a list of the lowest rated 100 films with at least 10,000 ratings. It now is number 97...but by the time you read this it might have changed position or might no longer be on the list.

I should point out that I have little interest in most action films...particularly Sylvester Stallone's. He's made a few very good movies, but, for the most part, I just don't enjoy the sorts of pictures he makes. So why did I watch it? Well, the answer is above...it's supposed to be a horrible film and sometimes I enjoy watching one of these to see if it's really as bad as its IMDB score would indicate.

Stallone is the head of some private group of 'good' mercenaries. They specialize in extricating prisoners from their evil captors around the world. As for Stallone, he is the boss and doesn't work in the field any more--and considering his age, it makes sense that he sends younger folks to run these missions. However, when one of his best men is kidnapped and sent to a 'super-duper prison', Stallone himself is going back to the field.

I felt mad when the film explained why the team member was kidnapped. Why? Because if the writers had even done some BASIC research, they would have learned that the plot was impossible. Let me explain: to receive a patent for an idea or product, you need to register it. When you do so, you describe the exact formula. The film supposedly has kidnapped the team member and his family member because this family member patented a secret plan which can disable the world's computers....but that plan should all described in the patent! What they really meant is that whatever he'd developed was top secret or the like...not a patented product. My wife have has a few patents and I understand this part of the process...apparently the writers did not!

What I also hated about the film is the prison the two are being kept in because it's like something out of a sci-fi movie. The prison supposedly is all automated and can rearrange and change...thus making it hard to plan on how to break into it. The idea is just dumb...let alone impossible with modern technology. It also is dumb that within this silly prison there are no holds barred fights...almost constantly. Just a lot of mindless macho theatrics if you ask me.

So is the rest of this badly written film any good? Well, for those who want punching, kicking, explosions and killing, the film will fit the goods...though this alone doesn't make a movie...or at least a good one. It's also slickly made...and it's obvious they spent a lot of money on the picture to make it look and sound good. But again, this doesn't mean the story is any good. And that brings me to the final thing I didn't like about the film....if you are going to spend $45,000,000 to make it, why is the weakest thing about the thing the writing/plot??

Overall, a slick but dopey film. I cannot see, however, anyone putting it in the Bottom 100...not because it's good but because there are hundreds of stupider and worse pictures. I assume this one made the list less because it's really among the very worst but was mostly a big disappointment to Stallone's fans."

Escape Plan 2 is like a sequel created by a computer algorithm, which is funny, because it is about a computer algorithm controlling the ""yet another most advanced prison in the world"". And it's more a Chinese film now, than an American one. Don't get me wrong, I liked that part, with the martial arts and the Sun Tzu like thinking. Only it was also really badly made as a story. It felt like a compilation of all the cinematics in a video game put on YouTube. The game would have been interesting, but it doesn't exist, while the cinematics are just like one would expect: rushed and not relatable.

Bottom line: if you started watching it, you probably like escape movies, so you will enjoy this, maybe. But look at the great cast: Stalone, Bautista, Wes Chatham (Amos from The Expanse), Xiaoming Huang (with great martial prowess)... even 50 Cent as a dorky hacker... ahem...

She is just dire. Not in acting (well... any more than usual, anyway) but just in the way her character made you want to shake her until she regained some sense. Whoever was responsible for the script needs a good beating here. Unless I am completely mistaken, her character between the events of the first film and this one, turned into a complete and total airhead bimbo.

Add in Jason Patric (who will never be leading man material) and it seems that only Willem Dafoe was having any fun. Truly awful!

But it is good to see that ocean liners, which may have to weather tropical storms, apparently have windows made of glass so easy to break that anyone can hurl themselves through them on a whim. Priceless cinema.

Avoid this one if you liked the original.

Avoid this one if you expect a thrilling sea drama.

Avoid this one if you like Sandra Bullock.

Avoid this one if....well....just avoid it."
3801,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"I was so curious as to what they would do in the sequel of Speed, I just watched Speed today and absolutely loved it! So, I can understand why Keanu turned down the movie, first off not only the script was bad, but the coincidences were beyond ridiculous of Sandra Bullock being in the same position twice and Jason Patrick?! He was so scared of doing a great movie like The Lost Boys, but yet he couldn't hesitate to do this movie? The movie just lost it's course and didn't work on any level, if it had different characters, maybe, but these great actors should know better and check twice before signing onto these sequels.

Annie is with this new policeman, Alex, and he surprises her with cruise tickets. He is planning on asking her to marry him, but that is shortly interrupted when Willaim Defoe is now the super duper bad guy. He is upset that he designed the ships computer system but gets no credit, so guess what? He decides the best way to avenge this is to blow it up! But with Alex on board... yup... you guessed it, he's gonna stop William and save the day! Good for him!

Speed 2: Cruise Control was just a money maker that is truly a fake movie that was really sad. The acting was really bad and Sandra's character went from admirable to just plain annoying. Alex had no character or any sympathy. The explosions were lame and the plot was just beyond unbelievable, poor William, he was probably on medication when he said yes to making this movie. Well, just please stay away from this movie, it'll be a waste of your time.

2/10"
3802,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"The enormous success of ""Speed"" in 1994 could only create a (poor) sequel. The less we can say is that the scriptwriters have got a great narrow-mindedness. Here, the bus was replaced by a cruise ship and the movie doesn't work, partly due to this: a cruise ship can't go as fast as a bus even if it's trapped.

Then, Keanu Reeves' absence can terribly be felt. His replacement is so colorless and listless that Sandra Bullock almost steals the show from him. Moreover, as a rule, ""Speed2: cruise control"" is supposed to be a suspense film. Well, in this case, where's the suspense? The filmmaker doesn't succeed in creating the suspense and he even can't create a disturbing atmosphere. The end of the movie falls into the ridiculous when the ship is entering the dock and destroys everything in its path.

At the end: one of the worst sequels ever made"
3803,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Having long since broken things off with her boyfriend, Annie and her new beau plan a romantic holiday on an ocean liner. When onboard a disgruntled ex-employee of the liner disables the computer controls and sets it on a collision course while he escapes with his goods. Alex has to take him on and try to stop the ship as it `races' out of control.

As if Twister hadn't done it already, Speed 2 basically showed us that the potential that was shown by De Bont's debut was clearly misplaced and he has yet to show he was really anything other than in the right place at the right time when it came to Speed. The smell of desperation is in the air from the very start when Reeves declined to star, although Bullock was more desperate and did it. This caused Annie to repeatedly state that `relationships built on etc etc never work out', all in an effort to explain it away and help the audience move on. That the film is constantly harking back to a much better film is a big problem, it would almost have been smarter just to move totally away than to retread.

The plot is plain silly and never gets close to being involving. To demonstrate this, I never once gave a rats' ass what was happening - people got crushed by the boat and mangled in it's propellers (unseen) but the film (or me) never care and never lingers. Likewise the supposed big climax is unengaging and smacks of desperation - bang for buck and all that. The whole set up never really feels immediate or threatening, even when the boat swings out of control it is difficult to feel terrified as the boat slooooowly goes towards the tanker, worst come to worst people can jump off to safety. The cruiser setting also is daft when seen beside the bus concept - the vast majority of the audience will ride a bus quite often, very few of us can relate to an ocean liner! The speed is a problem and it is almost laughable it works so poorly!

The cast is another problem. Bullock tries to repeat her sparky performance from the first film - when she manages it, it only feels like an impression, when she doesn't manage it she is cast as a shrieking beauty needing saving. However she also struggles from a lack of chemistry with Patric. It is a shame as he is an OK actor but not used to a pure action role and not used to not having material to work with. He lacks charisma and is quite unconvincing. Dafoe is awful; he drags the film down as much as anyone. His villain is a joke and never threatens in the way that Hopper's did (who managed to be funny and scary). It is a bad impression all round. The support cast of `innocents in peril' do much the same as the ones on the bus did, but we care less about them - they are well off and are separated from the action; those on the bus were in the thick of it and `normal' people who we could relate to.

Overall this is as good a reason for not making unplanned sequels as any - there should be a board to approve all sequels to prevent cashing in! The memory of the original is cheapen by this nasty film that is uninspiring and unthrilling at best, dull and stupid at worst. De Bont never gets up a decent head of steam and he shows his inability to inject drama out of his own skill - anyone can point a camera, not everyone can (or should) direct. A dull 2 hours later, I was wondering why I wasted my time with a film that was so clearly all at sea."
3804,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Speed. the first movie wasn't that bad, and so the other day I decided to watch speed 2, which appeared on television here. (god knows why) After 2 minutes I realized why Keanu didn't accept the role for this second part. The entire movie is filled with extremely bad timed jokes and unrealism beyond recognition... The killer being sandra bullock chainsawing open a fire door with people trapped behind that door (as if there wouldn't be an emergency handle, and what the **** is a chainsaw doing near the cabins?!?) After completing this task sandra keeps the chainsaw in the opening she just made. the people look at her and say she has to get out of the way with the chainsaw. she looks back, doesn't respond. They have to ask AGAIN and then she's all like: ""oh oh oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah, sorry sorry sorry."" taking another 5 minutes to apologize before she finally removes the roaring blade....

another great feature about this movie is the fact that people have to die 4 times before actually dying, or other impossible things that somehow the actors can make possible with their magic wand or something. a nice example: **** SPOILER **** The bad guy (i didn't even bother remembering his name) is flying one of those water planes. He isn't really paying attention as he flies over an oil tanker and hits the mast with a speed over 50 mph at minimum... Instead of crashing down or getting hit off course, nooo... the plane instantly stops and gets stuck at the top of the mast. The bad guy naturally hasn't a scratch. Then suddenly the plane decides to explode, taking the entire oil tanker with it. Of course there couldn't be any safety measures on board, since oil isn't flammable at all.

anyway my conclusion is that speed 2 is a blown up piece of poo, and should have never been made. this is one of those movies just to get people in the seats, leaving them to die of boredom in the theatre. (and was probably a career killer for sandra bullock, too....)"
3805,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Let the screenwriters and director go down with the ship I say. As the sun sets slowly in the West, Speed 2: Cruise Control sinks without a trace. The sequel to 1995's surprise drive-a-bus hit has barely caused a ripple at the box office. The threadbare script is mostly to blame. It consists almost entirely of simplistic, exclamation-point dialogue like, ""We're gonna crash!"" ""We're going too fast!"" ""Do something!"" ""This isn't happening!"" ""We gotta get him outta here!"" ""There's not much time left!"" and the ever useful, ""Oh, s**t!""

There is, indeed, not much time left for characterization or interpersonal drama. Speed 2 gets off to a winky-dinky start with Sandra Bullock taking yet another disastrous driving test. Bullock's natural charm can go only so far, however, and you keep wanting to throw her a life preserver or a new script. As people drop dead around her, she must continue to whine about the ruination of her vacation. Bullock doesn't get a lot of help from blandish co-star Jason Patric, who plays her cop boyfriend. The nasty, computer-literate villain, who likes to attach blood-sucking leeches to his body, is certainly quirky. Willem Dafoe, who's pretty quirky himself, does what he can with the overriding vagaries of his character's mad-bomber motivation. The action bits are fairly frequent, but seem anemic when compared to what else is available to fans of such. Director Jan De Bont fared much better in 1996 with the flying cows and funnel clouds of Twister. Speed 2 ends up with some highly anticipated destruction as the cruise ship plows into the island of St. Martin. No matter, as I hear the whole thing was computer-generated anyway. This cruise is no carnival, and could have used a cameo by Kathie Lee. Would loved to have seen Dafoe slap her around a bit."
3806,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"After seeing THE best action movie ever (Speed) I went to this expecting more of the same awesome action.

Instead I was physically sea sick! Sat through the entire thing feeling like I was at sea in a teacup (in the middle of a cyclone), made worse by the terrible acting (even Temuera Morrison wasn't up to par in this) and lame 'action scenes'. The baddie wasn't bad enough, his reasons for hijacking the ship was just plain dumb, and Keanu Reeves, where the heck was he?

This whole flick was over-the-top-bad, trying waaaaay too hard to equal Speed One. But putting all the action on a cruise ship - a SMALL cruise ship at that? There was twice as much action in the elevator scene at the beginning of Speed One!

I found the gigantic tanker explosion, the ship crashing through the dock at the end TOO long and boring. By this time, however, the sea sickness had subsided (probably because the ship had already landed!) The ending would've been easier to bare if the characters hadn't said such dumb cliches....

I think I should've stayed at home...."
3807,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Nah, it just isn't worth watching, or renting, why? Well let's just say it didn't live up to the first one. It wasn't very fast paced, or exciting, it was very predictable. And it's mostly them on the boat, trying to get everyone out, because it is out of control. It lost most of the elements the first one had. It didn't have the 'speed' theme, it was mostly a boat out of control, how? Someone just hacked it, and there it went, it wasn't on the threat of terrorists, there wasn't the threat of a bomb explosion, and it wasn't even sinking. Where's the excitement? The movie doesn't even deserve to be called 'Speed' because there was nothing about 'speed' in it, sure it had Sandra Bullock in it, but Keanu Reeves was missing in it. If you want to see a film about a boat out of control, just watch Titani"
3808,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Oh Dear. Speed never need a sequel. It was a solid action movie with good performances and - most importantly - lots of speed, the essence of the film. Unfortunately, Speed 2 lacks both of these things, as well as anything else which could make it a good film.

Annie (Bullock) is off on a cruise with her new boyfriend, Alex (Patric). But surprisingly things don't go to plan when a crazy ex-employee of the ferry company with a terminal disease (Dafoe) takes over the ship using only his laptop. So its up to Alex, Annie and a few stupid crewmen to save the day.

So that's it in the way of plot. I'd go onto character development but there's nothing to say about that so I'll skip to the acting. Although Bullock is given top billing, she is (unfortunately) relegated to the sidelines and Keanu replacement Jason Patric does most of the work. As for his acting abilities, lets just say a coffee table would have been more convincing. And you thought Keanu Reeves was wooden. Dafoe is almost as bad.

Another area of dire quality is the script. Actually, atrocious would be more appropriate. Unlike the original it's filled with lots of ""funny"" bits, which only made me cringe even more than I was doing before. Even the action is poor. Where Speed screamed along at 100mph, the sequel kind of meanders along like a pensioner driver.

Verdict: Bad story, bad acting, bad script, bad film. Sitting through this film is as torturous as listening to Westlife. So in case you haven't caught on yet, AVOID THIS FILM."
3809,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Even though I write this review almost seven years after viewing, I have to alert anyone who might be interested in renting or buying this heap. Surely this movie still can't be rented? Please, don't waste your money, just stick with the first Speed and walk away slowly.

At the time I was a projectionist for the movie theater where I worked. I had to watch this film to make sure the print was in good condition and that I put it together correctly. The only thing that made it worth seeing? I guess is that I was on the clock while watching. This movie was terrible and very uninteresting.

OK, the first Speed was exciting and interesting. Keanau Reeves is dopey, but he does give cool-headed action hero quality to his characters. So does he show up in the sequel? No. I'm sure he read the script or saw SOME red flag that made him think, ""Walk away slowly"". Perhaps he had other commitments. Either way he was fortunate enough to not be involved in this wreck. The villain, Willem Dafoe, is just not convincing (Ooooh, he's a disgruntled computer programmer!). Jason Patrick's character seems to be a cardboard stand-up, and Sandra Bullock gives classic lines like, ""Oh man!"". The end sequence DOES have an impact, but they drag it out SO LONG that I started laughing! I mean, one minute would have been cool to see all that destruction, but FIVE MINUTES of crashing?!? It might look cool to a six or seven year old (maybe a preteen), but for me it was a barrel of laughs...and this isn't suppose to be a comedy."
3810,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"I really don't understand how the director, Jan de Bont, goes from directing two solid movies, Speed and Twister, to making an awfully horrible sequel, Speed 2: Cruise Control. It really makes you wonder, ""What the hell happened?""

Speed 2: Cruise Control is just downright terrible. Keanu Reeves didn't come back because he did the right thing, and read the script and thought it sucked. Basically this time around, instead of on a bus, it takes place on a cruise ship. This was a stupid idea to begin with from the get-go.

Sandra Bullock comes back as her character Annie, and has a new boyfriend, Alex (played by Jason Patric), and they go on a cruise ship for a vacation, and there is a crazed passanger named John (played by Willem Dafoe) that hijacks the cruise, and is heading to blow up. So now Annie and Alex do what they can to fight for survival.

This movie had such a stupid concept. The acting was godawful, there was hardly any action, and it so incredibly boring. Sandra Bullock was unlikable, Jason Patric was a weak follow up for Keanu Reeves, and Willem Dafoe was mediocre as the villan. The opening to this movie was also very rushed tells you right from there that it is going to suck badly.

Overall, this movie blows."
3811,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Favorite parts?

The lifeboat rescue scene. It seems like it takes half an hour to conclude this ""action"" scene. It was long enough for me to notice part of the problem. The soundtrack! Music is supposed to set the mood and blend into the film invisibly. The music chosen for this sequence, I suspect, should have been selected to incite pulse pounding nail-biting excitement. Instead, we are treated to a sad, tragedy-laden violin concerto appopriate akin to a funeral dirge. The non-sequitor was surrealistically hilarious.

The beaching of the liner. The ocean liner grounds itself not 100 feet out to sea when the bottom of the boat wedges into the sand but OVER the beach and after it tears up the boardwalk taking out a few flimsy oceanfront hotels that would have been carried away a la Wizard of Oz by any respectable hurricane. The writers appear to have neglected that ocean liners don't skim on the surface of water like jet-skis. Even supposing it did, liners are triangular and would fall over if placed on a beach. Ya kinna defy the laws of physics, cap'n!

Dreadful failed attempt at suspense. When big boats go bad they do it slowly. Yes it takes miles for a ship at full throttle to come to a stop, but the moment of tension occurs a good fifteen minutes before impact. After that, it's a matter of waiting for the inevitable. It's a matter of forlorn mourning, not edge-of-your-seat terror. Titanic captured this well. Speed 2 desperately tries to make a 30 mph crash have the same feel as a NASCAR crack-up. It just can't be done.

To round out the rationale... The acting is wooden, our beloved steely bus driver of Speed has been replaced by a piece of arm candy that Jack would've thrown out the window. Jack supplanted by a generic cleft-chin Dudley Doright named ""Alex"". The rest is recycled badly. A park bench with the Budweiser labels poking out from inside."

Sadly, this follow up set on a slow moving cruise ship lacked the impetus of the original's theme-as-action. It has some very impressive stunts and it never fails to look busy, but the story is crammed with too many action events and has a drab script. The dialogue is cliched, the characterization as thin as gruel, the plot devices overfamiliar, and the action sequences fail to generate any excitement. Jason Patric fails to fully impose himself as the lead and Sandra Bullock is disappointingly sidelined into producing a frenetic character and she ends up overworking her character. Willem Dafoe looks the part but acts tough rather than playing tough. All in all, it's action packed but froths over.

3817,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Possibly the worst film ever made. Not just from of the content of the film, but because the film makers wasted over 100 million dollars making the film whose best aspect is that it shares the same title as the original.

Speed 2 consists of a two hour sequence of a bad story, supported by a lot of shallow acting and shocking dialogue. The first half has the feeling and depth of an episode of the love boat. Sandra Bullock displays the full range of her acting ability as she did in the first film, but this time the direction and script don't come to the rescue. Teaming up with Sandra is Jason Patric, who is relatively uknown in big money holywood circles and he shows you why. His acting is flat, shallow and uninteresting and most of the time you could care if he was water skiing naked off the back of the boat. From here the bad guy (Willem Defoe) starts to do his stuff and the show falls into a ramble of shodily put together events which seems to have little to do with each other or the script.

At this point the director probably could have saved the film by playing off the acting skills of Willem Defoe in a head-to-head type matchup of skill and wits. But the director chooses the special effects path for the film to take and wastes the characters of Willem Defoe and Tumuera Morrison and instead of running away to a speay climax, the film slows to a halt with a scene that explain where the majority of the film budget disappeared to.

All I can say is : How dare people waste the sort of money that goes into a such as this!! Was it made as a joke by some hollywood producer to laugh in the faces of smalltime unsigned film makers who could make 50 decent films for the price of this one ? I guess we'll never really know, since all we have as an answer is the two hours of awfullness that sombody called a film."

I don´t really buy Sandra´s lame excuse. Does she mean that, since De Bont gave her career a big boost, he´s allowed to ruin it as well? After a few years, Sandra has managed to get up on her feet again, but she had big problems to find good parts at first. This is pretty understandable, because Speed 2: Cruise Control is really terrible.

Here, Sandra has a new boyfriend, played by Jason Patric. That´s because Keanu Reeves decided not to reprise his role from the first film (wise move, Keanu). Anyway, when Sandra and Jason goes on a cruise to the Caribians to relax, a madman (Willem Dafoe) takes control of the ship. But Sandra´s new boyfriend is a SWAT-member, just as Keanu was, and he decides to stop the terrorist on his own.

Speed 2: Cruise Control is too long, the effects are laughable and the characters are some of the most irritating ever created. Pretty soon, you´ll wish that the whole ship would just sink, like Titanic. If the ship would have sunk, the film would´ve been great. You can see that the film has a big budget, and the people behind it obviously had high expectations of it, since it´s the sequel of a very good film. But it doesn´t have any of the exciting action that the first one had.

Sandra Bullock is very annoying, Jason Patrick is way to dull to carry the film, and Willem Dafoe doesn´t do a good job either. All the supporting actors are just plain stupid. And the dutch director Jan De Bont only proves three things: 1. that Speed was one time-hit, 2. that he should go back to the time when he was a cinematographer, where he´s done some very good work, and 3. that he sucks when it comes to writing good scripts.

Speed 2: Cruise Control, is one of those films which I will never watch again in my entire life.

3839,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Why are so many sequels bad? One of the main reasons is that they were not planned until the first film became so successful. This success prompts movie studios to make a needless sequel in the hope that the name alone will draw big bags of currency. These sequels are often bad because the originals did not leave any space for another movie. ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" is a sequel in name only. It cost nearly four times as much as ""Speed"" although its earnings were significantly lower. No link exists in setting and plot, and the premises are completely different.

Sandra Bullock reprises her role as the lovable Annie Porter, this time with Jason Patric playing her boyfriend. The dialogue explains that she broke up with Keanu Reeves' character from the first film for a number of reasons, but the real reason is that Reeves did not want to make a sequel. A bald Joe Morton and Glenn Plummer have cameos, but aside from that and a few humorous references to ""Speed"" there is no connection.

Annie and her boyfriend Alex Shaw (Jason Patric) decide to go on a Caribbean cruise aboard the luxurious Seabourn Legend and have the bad luck to be on the same vessel with John Geiger (Willem Defoe). Geiger spent years designing the computer systems on the ships and can take control from his laptop. He is bitter because his exposure to the computers gave him severe copper poisoning and the company fired him when they found out. He now takes several prescriptions and carries a jar of leeches to suck the copper from his blood. Apparently nobody learned from George Washington's death.

After murdering the Seabourn Legend's captain, Geiger sets off a series of smoke bombs, conveniently hidden in his golf clubs, and gives the first mate (Temuera Morrison) fifteen minutes to evacuate. This proves to not be enough time, but Geiger restarts the engine anyway, and sets it on a collision course with a colossal oil tanker.

Willem Defoe, The Man with the Golden Laugh, comes through with a rock solid performance once again. He is funny, charming, and extremely weird. Take for example when he vents towards the ship's captain. He sates, ""That's what really infuriates me, you don't even know what I'm talking about!"" in a voice of anguish that does not sound normal. Nothing about Geiger is normal. I felt sorry for him, but not enough to justify his actions. After seeing this and ""Spider-Man,"" my dad wondered out loud if Defoe could go into public places without getting funny looks.

The action onboard the ship is the film's best in concepts, execution and intensity. Director Jan de Bont establishes many of the ship's sets so the layout seems familiar when the action starts. It is in the final half hour that the operation falls apart and loses its recommendation. It involves a nutty boat chase and a crash scene that is supposed to be amazing but is undermined by fake effects and jokes that seem inspired by Abbott and Costello.

Another turn off may be the absurdity of the stunts, such as the sequence with the seaplane or the bit where Shaw floats mere feet away from one of the liner's propellers and eventually stops them with a cable. ""Speed 2"" embraces its goofiness with pleasure, but overkill proves to be its undoing. It is certainly not one of the worst movies ever made, but it too often crosses the line into farce."

3844,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"This film is as stupid as a ship that's trying to leave port but they forgot to take the anchor off first, Keanu Reeves made the right career decision to not return for the sequel to the 1994 blockbuster hit film which by the way leads to a big problem as it's like Die Hard but without John McClane, instead we have to make do with a very boring and poor substitute lead hero Officer Alex Shaw played by Jason Patric. Sandra Bullock on the other hand respires her role as Annie but she has since regretted returning to this complete mess of a sequel.

Where do I begin? Well first of all there's a scene where Sandra Bullock's character is using a chainsaw to free many trapped people on the ship, why there's a chainsaw on a cruise ship beats me. But after making an opening for them, she's still got the chainsaw on hand and she's got it rather too close to the trapped guy on front, are you f****** crazy? Could have gone full on Texas Chain Saw Massacre on that guy and she's like ""Duuuurrrr"". It's like they turned her character into an idiot while in the original film she wasn't that stupid.

The action was very campy, most of the characters are very bad with poor acting, it lacks the seriousness which the original film had and worst of all it's like the people who were making this movie had no clue what they were doing. There obviously was no quality control whatsoever.

It just blows my mind that this awful movie is a sequel to an awesome movie and this film is often regarded as one of the worst sequel movies ever. I suggest that you should at least watch the excellent Speed and the Father Ted episode ""Speed 3"", the latter of which is still miles better than Speed 2."
3845,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Speed was a great movie with an interesting plot and fast-paced action that kept your attention for the whole movie. Speed 2 was an unnecessary sequel which plodding pace makes it hard to sit through even with tons of action on screen.

Premise: A psychotic computer genius(played by Willem Dafoe) takes control of a ship(via a computer) and tries to crash it into an oil tanker miles away. A couple aboard the ship try to save the passengers as well as stop him.

Opinion: What a truly pointless sequel this was. Sandra Bullock has never been more annoying. Willem Dafoe was great in Mississippi Burning, The Clearing, Platoon and the otherwise abysmal State Of The Union but here he is reduced to some cornball villain pissing and moaning about a job that laid him off for being sick. What a waste. Jason Patric is okay but he's seen better days on the silver screen. The script looked like it was written by an imitator that admired the first and the special effects are quite dull. Don't waste 2 hour and 5 minutes of your life on a sequel that was rightfully panned. Stick with Speed and pretend like Cruise Control never existed. Im pretty sure everybody else that has seen it has."
3846,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert were the only film critics that gave Speed 2 thumbs up. I think they were the only ones in the world that liked it. If not for them, this movie would have 0% on Rotten Tomatoes instead of the 3% it does have. I can see them liking some aspects and some parts, but both guys actually thinking this was a good movie is beyond me. Honestly, I found this movie worse than Batman & Robin. Batman & Robin tried to be cheesy and kiddie, but it accidentally crossed the line between fun and stupidity. That movie's weirdness just got old after a while and was actually fun in many parts. Speed 2 was not comical and did not become old after a while. Here's what happens, Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric go on a cruise were madman Willem Dafoe uses crazy computer schemes to blow everything up. Sounds good and fresh right? The first half-hour actually is good. People having fun on a cruise, Jason Patric going to propose to Sandra Bullock. When the movie switches gears by becoming more of an action movie as Dafoe hijacks the ship, that is when everything becomes very bad very quickly. If the movie would have stayed the way it was the first little bit, I would have liked this movie just as much as Siskel and Ebert. But nobody knew a ship being taken over would not work, that idea hasn't been done a whole lot and when it has been done, it turns out to be a success. The main problem with is the acting and dialogue (the two are in conjunction in this case). Sandra Bullock is one of Hollywood's best actresses who does a mega crappy job in this. Jason Patric started off okay, but the gear switching made him just as bad as his on-screen girlfriend. Everybody else in this movie is just as bad. The saviour is Willem Dafoe. He was the only reason I did not just turn off my TV. Dafoe is an awesome actor who nails this as an insane computer hacker. But even he got stuck with some poorly written dialogue. Some of the destructive scenes on the ship and filming techniques are actually pretty good, until a dumb character blurts out laughable material. But eventually, even the disaster scenes become boring and the CGI becomes funny too.

3848,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"From the fact that Reeves himself turned down the opportunity to star in this sequel to the pitifully awful pun in the subtitle of the film, this is just so obviously a bad idea, and one with pretty poor execution, at that. The plot is silly, and a weak attempt at recapturing the essence of the first(which, in turn, was a somewhat half-hearted attempt at recreating that of Die Hard, a film that is far superior to either). Taking the idea(which basically originated in Die Hard... Speed just gave it a shot of, well, speed) out to sea was never a particularly interesting one(what does a colossal cruiser far out on the water have to offer that a bus that needs to keep a high speed on the freeway doesn't?), and what little potential it may have had is hardly utilized. The pacing is, much like that of the first, too intense. We aren't given time to stop and breathe, to take in all the(as a result, downright overwhelming) action. The acting, save for one or two parts, is unimpressive. Odd, seeing as such talented names are on the cast. Morrison and Dafoe have given quite good performances both before and after this film... heck, even Bullock has a fair acting job or two behind her. The dialog is dreadful. The characters are half-heartedly written. Why is Annie now such a crummy driver? In the first one, she was said to be fine behind the wheel. And who thought of adding that annoying Scotsman? Anyone who's seen the film will know what I mean. And no, it wasn't his nationality... it was all his character. The clichés return... the new villain also cackles, there's a new hero cop, and the damsel is, yet again, in distress. All in all, this probably shouldn't have been made at all, and it certainly shouldn't have been a sequel to Speed(which, while by no means great, was certainly a whole lot better than this). I recommend this to the fans of the first and of the Die Hard type films who *must* see it, no matter how bad they hear it is(you know who you are!). Everyone else should probably just avoid. 1/10"

Plot In A Paragraph: Annie (Sandra Bullock) and her new beau Alex (Jason Patrick, who I last saw in ""Lost Boys"") are taking a vacation in the Caribbean aboard a luxury cruise ship, which is hijacked by a villain (Willem Defoe) who hacked into the ship's computer system. As they are trapped aboard the ship, Annie and Alex work with the ship's first officer (The guy who plays Jango Fett in Star Wars) to try to stop the ship, which they discover is programmed to crash into an oil tanker.

OK is it as bad as people say?? No it's far from it. It just doesn't live up to the first movie. A lot of sequels suffer from that problem. Had this movie just being called ""Cruise Control"" and references to the first movie dropped, it may have done better. To put it simply, this is just another routine action movie.

The film's final scene, where the ship crashes into the island of Saint Martin, cost $25 million of the film's $160 million budget (which is more than the entire production budget of the first film)

As for Sandra Bullock (who agreed to star in this film in order to get financing for her pet project Hope Floats) she remains one of the most talented and beautiful women in movies, and her ladylike sexiness is in rare supply. Any movie becomes promising just by having her name in it's cast."

The original Speed was absolutely awesome, fantastic action scenes, over-the-to casting, directing, script and wonderful music. As for Speed 2, I have the idea that the producers and director thought that if they did another movie, based on the same material, although with different means, Elevator peril-----Motorcycle chase; Bus danger -----Boat Danger and Subway Danger-----Helicopter/ Tanker danger, would work out well. It didn't. Somehow it didn't, the movie is sometimes boring and slow, almost losing its way after 30 minutes in it. The special effects aren't top notch, and don't satisfact the viewer as much as their mission should.

3856,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"You can tell EXACTLY why Keanu turned it down and rejected Speed 2 even though he was offered a $12 million paycheck. Just watch the entire film and you'll see why: it's flat out boring and lame. Unnecessary sequel. For me, that was a very wise move, Keanu! I would totally give him the props (bro fist) and five thumbs up, not for ditching Jan and Sandra but for criticizing the film's plot, setting and script. He knows what a horrible, shitty sequel is when he sees it. Even if Keanu returned as Jack, he would truly shine as Jack but that's not enough to save this movie. You're better off watching the first film. Great decision Keanu! You truly deserve a raise! Jason Patrick, although he does do his best to shine as Annie's new policeman fiancé, let's face it: NOBODY, not even Jason can replace Keanu's role (no offence). Jack has just the right facial appearance and the right amount of mischief in his eyes to be a born heroic cop. He's the MAN! Although Sandra, Willem and director Jan try to prevent this already waterlogged sequel from sinking to the bottom of the ocean by inserting some twists and turns, a few action sequences and some laughable dialogue, the biggest flop of this sequel is the lack of thrill with a slow-moving cruise ship rather than a fast, wired-for-explosive-destruction bomb laden city bus zooming above 50 MPH through the streets of Los Angeles and ending up at the airport. Even when the ship crashes into a beach town of Saint Martin bringing it to a halt, look at how slow the ship is, even at full speed. It BARELY damaged the area. I mean, look at the substantial amount of deceleration in this film. It was slower and poorer, like a garbage truck or by watching paint dry. As soon as Kenau declined to reprise his role as Jack, Sandra (as Annie) should have followed. The director Jan could have done a better job at the plot line and setting like have Daniel Payne (Howard's son) avenge his father's death by rigging a huge C4 in the cargo area of a Boeing 737 that Jack, his wife Annie and their two sons are flying on vacation to Hawaii activate if it accelerates above 185 knots and ascends above 2300 feet (the captain or first officer gets injured leaving the other pilot to fly the plane with Jack and Annie assisting him. After ALL the hostages parachute to safety from the moving plane, the out of fuel Boeing 737 nosedives into the ground. Jack, Mac and Annie continue to defeat Daniel using a slightly different scam than from the first film. After Jack, Mac and Annie kill Daniel, they all head home into the sunset or eat pizza in a restaurant. That's more like what the plot should have been; on a fast moving vehicle, with Keanu and Sandra's characters married (they make such an adorable couple) and a few newcomer child actors for the two sons. This flopped sequel just killed the speed film franchise. I doubt there will ever be a Speed 3 (Keanu declined the possibility of a third film) and if there is and reunites Keanu and Sandy, I just hope they can still maintain their young looks from the '90s. Annie's character is significantly reduced here. Also, Glenn Plummer, Joe Morton and Sandra Bullock are the only ones to reprise. Jan should have abandoned the project for a sequel when Reeves quit."

He must prevent an ocean liner whose computer system has been hacked and controlled by psychopath John Geiger (William Dafoe) from crashing into an oil tanker.

The action and urgency was pretty exciting, just a bit slower than the previous film. This sequel takes on on a very slow start and also lacks the some of the suspense which kept its prequel captivating. But, the thrills in this movie are a pretty edge-of-your-seat experience, particularly the runaway boat sequence.

Patric gave a bland and emotionless performance as Officer Shaw; basically, he did a terrible job in his role. Sandra Bullock returns to the cast and gave a stirring performance as Annie Porter. Overall, it's not as exciting as Speed, but it has a lot of campy action fun.

3858,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Speed 2: Cruise Control ranks with ""Batman and Robin"" as rubbish sequels that deserved to be flushed down the toilets and never be made into VHS or DVD's at all.

Why did this sequel needed to be made? Where's Keanu Reeves? I know Sandra Bullock is a cutie, but Keanu really made the original ""Speed"" a top mark thriller where not only was it a original masterpiece of heroes, villains and memorable characters. Now Sandra Bullock reprises her role as Annie where instead of kind of calm, she's annoying and makes me want to kill myself.

Instead of a bus, we have a boat now! Jeez, what can go wrong? After Annie's boyfriend Alex (Jason Patric) risks too many challenges on the job, she wants him to take a break on a cruise ship where all of their problems might go away. Think again. The new villain is played by eccentric and gifted actor Willem Dafoe in a waste where his mission is to blow up a ship just for the fun of it. Dennis Hopper's character in the first Speed was not only a sadistic maniac, but used his threats as a way of ransom. Not only did Hopper's character wanted money, but he wanted to show his accomplishment to prove that villains kick ass.

Annie and Alex have to stop the new maniac and save everybody. It uses too much of the original movie where there's no spark to explode this piece of dung."
3859,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"About the only good thing you can say about this film is that there are some beautiful scenery shots. Imagine you're on a cruise ship sitting by a deck pool, and ignore the insidiously absurd plot, and you just might be able to sit through this. Then again, no.

Sandra Bullock, normally a fun actress to watch, even in silly movies, just looks painfully embarrassed in this mess. She's up against some heavy breathing guy who sweats profusely (even in air conditioned areas) and likes to taunt people with threats. He's ticked off at somebody, so he decides to blow a cruise ship to bits to exact revenge. It turns out he has another ulterior motive, but you'll find you really don't care, anyway.

Who else but the hero of ""Speed"" should just happen to be aboard (with a new and very boring boyfriend since Keanu Reeves wisely nixed this one), and is the only person who has any plans to save the ship. Don't know about the ship, but even Sandra couldn't help the movie. Poorly contrived script, abysmal acting, unfunny one-liners, unconvincing action all play a part, but it can all be summed up briefly: the film is just idiotic. Look for the ludicrous ultimate fate of an out-of-control cruise ship. Utterly preposterous. Yet, as if that wasn't enough, the movie then assaults you with some over-the-top wanna-be James Bond tomfoolery.

Sandra would do well to omit this movie from her job resume."
3860,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"WHOA!!! What a mistake THIS was!!! Somehow between 1994 and 1997 they forgot what made Speed great and put this sorry excuse for a movie together. How dare they even put Speed as part of the title. A COMPLETE insult as far as I'm concerned. I always think of this movie as ""the rubbish one without Keanu Reeves"".

That brings me to the first thing I hated about this movie. I missed the obvious on-screen chemistry between him and Sandra Bullock and is it because Reeves didn't take part in this film that the writers turned his character (Jack Traven) from being a really cool guy sound like a complete jerk. The guy they replaced him with was CERTAINLY no Keanu Reeves and I wouldn't be surprised if this film ended the actor's career (I've yet to see him in anything else).

Cruise Control's villain was far to comic for my liking and lacked that certain 'something' that made Dennis Hopper's portrayal of Howard Payne a worthy adversary to Reeves' Jack Traven. Dennis Hopper's acting in Speed was FANTASTIC and, again, the chemistry between him, Keanu Reeves, and Sandra Bullock was strong and not lost among the BRILLIANT Special Effects and EXCELLENT stunt work unlike Cruise Control.

The acting talent and chemistry between the characters in Cruise Control is totally lost and nowhere near as strong as that in Speed.

Even the special effects in Cruise Control don't seem to have the same impact as those in Speed.

Reeves and Hopper ARE missing from this and noticeably as well. Reeves because he declined to appear and Hopper because his character lost some...height...in Speed and Bullock should NEVER have been in this at ALL!

Oh yes, he made box-office dud Speed 2: Cruise Control (before putting the final nails in his career coffin with The Haunting and Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life). While I'm no fan of the original Speed, it did at least deliver almost non-stop action, but Speed 2 spends much of its run-time dead in the water, as Willem Dafoe's villain John Geiger brings state-of-the-art cruise liner Seabourn Legend to a halt so that he can steal a fortune in jewellery. Even when the boat is moving, this sequel fails to live up to the Speed monicker: they're not called 'cruise ships' for nothing.

Keanu Reeves wisely jumped ship after the first movie, leaving the hero role to go to Jason Patric, who is unbelievably more wooden than his predecessor; Sandra Bullock looks great as before, but her character is irritating this time around, having lost all the charm and lovability she previously possessed. Dafoe is simply terrible, hamming it up even worse than Dennis Hopper, all leering grin and wild eyes.

The film builds slowly towards it's spectacular climax, in which the ship has a near miss with an oil tanker and crashes into a Caribbean island instead (spectacular but strangely uninvolving), chucking in nonsense involving improbable technology (Dafoe controlling the whole ship with a portable computer), Bullock brandishing a chainsaw, and a deaf fourteen year old girl who has the hots for Patric. For an action film, it's all frustratingly daft and dull."
3868,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"For those who have seen the first instalment from 1994, Speed 2 this time follows Anne (Sandra Bullock) instead of Jack and lots of things have changed since we last saw Anne escape an exploding bus...

Our film begins with Anne attempting her driver's test (and oh boy is she a bad driver now...) and quickly lets us know that Anne has in fact moved on from Jack and their relationship has ended. But thankfully Anne has met someone completely different who is nothing like her last boyfriend... or so she thinks.

Anne is disappointed when she discovers her current boyfriend, Alex (Jason Patric), is in fact working as a Swat member just like her last boyfriend did, living day to day like a wild man saving lives. But this time something is different as Alex confesses and sweetens his apology for not being honest by taking Anne on a cruise ship for a romantic getaway. Naturally Anne is mad, but she forgives him on the spot because... Yay for cruise ships, right?

But what begins as a romantic time for our leading characters becomes a completely new nightmare when a mad computer hacker alters the ship's computer, sending the large cruise ship straight into INTO OR TOWARDS? an oil tanker.

Compared to the original action smash hit, Speed 2 pulls on the handbrake in regards to both plot and its leading characters (yep, I'm getting into it!). The film basically turns Anne into a silly (and annoying) character. Previously we witnessed Anne save lives while driving a Bus, but here Anne is just not the same. At the opening of the film, Anne is trying to complete her driving test and is risking lives, implying she is the worst driver in the world. She lost her licence for speeding in the 1st film... not because she's the worst in the world! Not to mention the film destroys and flushes one of the greatest things from the 1st film- Jack. Let's talk about Anne's relationship. If you liked Jack (Keanu Reeves) previously, you will be shocked to find he's not here, plus the film likes to rag him out as if he were a horrible man. All of this occurs within the film's opening sequence.

Instead of Jack, we have Alex, who is suppose to have the same level of skill, perhaps be even more dangerous. Alex and Anne's relationship never feels real and I found it very hard to believe that Alex is a wild man who saves lives. To put it rudely, the film has down-graded when it comes to the love interest, instead feeling cheesy and forced. This element really surprised me considering the film has the same director as the original film.

As a plot, it's also a disappointment. Speed had such a fast pacing plot I found myself grabbing my seat at every moment, but Speed 2 doesn't deliver any of these things. Speed 2's general threat is nothing exciting or thrilling. The concept of a boat heading towards an oil tanker doesn't make me sit on the edge of my seat in suspense. Alex and Anne are also dealing with a new villain simply by luck and the film creates no real chemistry between any of the leads throughout the film. But! If I had to pick one character I enjoyed slightly, it would have to be the actor William Defoe who always knows how to play a cool (and yet silly) villain.

I'm not all negative about everything in this sequel. I can praise a couple of minor things. Personally I enjoyed hearing the original Speed theme returning, especially during the film's opening sequence as Alex chases a man with stolen goods (cheesy scene but set to a great tune) and to my surprise the film's visuals are pretty solid. The film does take on a brighter tone compared to the last film. William Defoe also gives a couple of creepy moments on screen, but as for the plot and leading actors... Nope I don't like it. If you watch the special features, I was amazed at how much work went in visually, not to mention what the financing of this film would have been. In short, big bucks, big effects, poor results.

Overall, this is a rather disappointing instalment to what was an action smash hit. With main characters who are painful to watch and are unbelievable (plus cheesy) as a couple, the same could be about the film's side characters too. Even with some fun visual effects and the return of Speed's instrumental track, Speed 2 is one of those sequels that causes us to question how they got this film so wrong. Other films such as Grease 2, xXx 2, Universal Solider 2 all fall into the same pile of sequels that should ultimately be ignored and avoided at all costs.

I knew what i was getting myself into watching this movie with all the negative feedback for this movie, but i just had to see it; I now regret watching it. This movie is nothing like the prequel; Its not thrilling at all and i got bored after the first 50 minutes which was alright to be honest, but it goes downhill after that. The plot is also not great and didn't make sense in some parts, like why would you deliberately let water onto a cruise ship? But the damage was done when they decided to set the movie on a cruise ship which was such a bad idea, especially when the title of the movie is called 'Speed'.

To be honest, the movie wouldn't have got so much negativity if it wasn't a sequel of 'Speed' and i probably would give it a higher rating in that case, but i believe the negativity is justified because the prequel was so thrilling, had great action scenes and had a intriguing plot, whereas this movie was the complete opposite. It's so disappointing; no wonder Keanu Reeves didn't want to star in it and i feel sorry for Sandra Bullock who tried getting out of the movie, but had to in order to star in another movie which she wanted to do."
3874,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Speed was a great action movie.

Speed 2: Cruise Control was a crazy mess that never recovered from Keanu Reeves passing up on the sequel.

Sandra Bullock does appear but she has had a personality transfer from the first film. Here she plays a ditzy damsel in distress playing it for laughs.

Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) is now going out with Alex Shaw (Jason Patric) who she thinks works in patrolling the beach but is in fact a member of a SWAT team.

Shaw takes Annie on a Caribbean cruise. On the cruise is John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) a disgruntled computer expert fired by the ship company due to his ill health.

Geiger uses his IT skills to take control of the ship and send it on a collision course with an oil tanker. Alex attempts to stop him and save the passengers.

Speed 2 is slow to get going. Once it does, the slow moving cruise liner never gathers pace. The script is awful with a jokey attitude.

There is a great action scene at the end as the cruise liner crashes into a marina but is again played for laughs. Patric is bit of a blank. The fault lies with the screenplay that had paper thin characters."

Also, how could the same director of the brilliant original 'Speed' make such a mess of a film? The non-funny supposed-to-be-humorous dialogue is annoying, to say the least. The result is a film that plays like a spoof and is not taken seriously, nor is it funny. The film has no suspense whatsoever and also lacks on excitement. The silly dialogue - especially from Sandra Bullock's character Annie even during action sequences - is so bad it is laughable. The film also has a ridiculous plot that makes nothing believable or convincing. The 'abandon ship' procedure (and the reason therefore) is so utterly pathetic that I won't even go into it!!

3879,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"If there was ever an action movie that didn't warrant a sequel, it's ""Speed"". However, the film grossed enough money to be numbered among the big summer hits of 1994, and the unfortunate result is this film, which reunites director Jan de Bont with Sandra Bullock, while leaving Keanu Reeves somewhere safe and dry, ""working on his music"" with his band, Dogstar. Considering the dubious quality of the final product, this may be the wisest decision of the young actor's career. ""Speed 2"" can be numbered among the worst second chapters ever made.

The original ""Speed"" was an entertaining jolt of pure adrenaline that took everyone by surprise. De Bont was an instant success and Bullock became a hot commodity. It was almost inevitable that any sequel, no matter how thrilling, would be a letdown. What no one anticipated was how sharply the downturn would be. Not only is ""Speed 2"" missing the first movie's main character, but the excitement seems to have departed with him.

This time around, Keanu Reeves, who portrayed Jack Traven in the first one, has been replaced by Jason Patric, who plays a new cop, Alex Shaw. For the most part, they're the same person (it shouldn't surprise anyone to learn that Alex was originally written as Jack), and their function is identical. The highest paid member of the cast, Sandra Bullock, is back as Annie Porter. Now, having broken up with Jack, she's in the midst of a long-term relationship with Alex. Things are a little rocky between them, so Alex comes up with a solution: a romantic cruise to the Caribbean on the Seabourn Legend. However, just like John McClane in the ""Die Hard"" series, Annie is about to find herself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Also aboard the Seabourn Legend is a mentally-unstable computer genius named John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) who intends to take over the ship, crank the engines up to full power, and crash it into something very big.

""Speed 2"" is a classic example of ""sound and fury, signifying nothing."" Only, in this case, that ""nothing"" isn't bolstered by the high-energy tension and tremendous special effects of de Bont's previous excursion, ""Twister"". ""Speed 2"" is lackluster -- the plot methodically drives the film from one action set-piece to another, and the visuals are merely adequate. In fact, the only real thrill offered by ""Speed 2"" comes during the bloated movie's final half-hour (as the ship's collision course becomes apparent). By then, it's too little, too late.

The original ""Speed"" was frantically paced and featured a number of individuals that, in spite of their two-dimensionality, were likable and exhibited human characteristics. We felt like we were trapped on the fast-moving bus with them. This time, the pace and characters are mechanical, and it doesn't seem as if we're actually on board the endangered and slow-moving cruise ship. Instead, we're watching form a detached vantage point, noticing details that we're not supposed to be paying attention to (like what kind of lighting best highlights Bullock's features) or waiting in vain for someone to break into a chorus of ""The Love Boat.""

Jason Patric has only one mode: serious guy. He makes Kristen Stewart look like an Academy Award contender in comparison. There's no sense of fun or goofiness. I never thought I would admit to missing Reeves, but that's the situation here -- at least he understood the right tone to adopt. Meanwhile, Bullock plays the same part the same way (albeit for a lot more money) -- she looks cute, gets involved in a couple of action scenes, and is taken hostage. But Sandy and Jason never click; their chemistry is glacial.

Since Dennis Hopper's Howard Payne was decapitated at the end of Speed, the sequel needs a new villain. Enter Willem Dafoe, who's usually a good psycho. Not here, though. Geiger has no manic energy, and Dafoe doesn't seem particularly excited to be playing him. ""Speed 2"" is the kind of film that demands a strong opponent, but Geiger isn't it. And in the end of ""Speed 2"" Geiger dies...laughing? Meanwhile, there are a pointless cameos from musicians such as Carlinhos Brown, Tamia and the reggae band UB40.

Watching ""Speed 2"", I felt embarrassed for everyone involved. Sure, they're all being well- paid, but no one wants a $120 million flop on their resume. And, once the word gets out about how disappointing this movie is, crowds will dwindle. There are enough action alternatives out there to sate the public's summer appetite. Someone should have recognized what an appropriate metaphor the climactic sequence (which features massive destruction) is for the entire film. ""Speed 2"" appears headed for a box office disaster of titanic proportions. Creatively and entertainment-wise, it's already sunk.

Conclusion: this movie is a total garbage and that no longer left me wanting a ""Speed 3"". What it will be about? Will it be on a plane? No, we already had ""Passenger 57"", ""Turbulence"" and ""Con Air"". With a little bit of imagination, would be an outer space travel, with a rocket/shuttle to Mars....but with Ben Affleck playing another cop (and Sandy's new boyfriend) who is the only that saves everyone from John Travolta as the hijacker? No, thanks. I'd rather to stay with the bus 2,525 mph and my almost 2 hours of action and explosions of quality than to see that.

P.S .: To all those comments that say ""Speed 2"" is better than the first, I do not think they praise it so much because the actor (Jason) has the name of a Power Ranger. So, StuOZ, go watch ""The Rugrats Movie"" instead. And for ""samanthahibbert"", please, this is an action movie, not a romantic comedy of those played by Katherine Heigl (who is maybe your idol)."
3880,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour and this thing was on the telly so I decided to give another shot to a film I always detested from my very first view back when I was a kid. There was room for some improvement in between those 20 years but ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" still sucks. Keanu Reeves was smart enough to not go on board of this shipwreck (literally), Sandra Bullock was only in it for the money; Jason Patric became an interesting hero but never captured the same vibes and confidence Reeves had in ""Speed""; but Willem Dafoe shows that whenever he plays nuts and crazy he always delivers something worth seeing or at least worth remembering. This movie is a mess of all sorts, you can watch it drunk or sober and the effect is practically the same: a worthless piece of garbage that hasn't any redeeming quality...except for seeing a cruise ship invading an island.

""Speed"" (1994) was so good that they actually predicted what was about to come in this second installment: ""Relationships based on intense experiences never work."" Spot on! Annie and Jack split up but the unluckiest girl in the world managed to attract another cop (Patric), and here's a guy who's truly committed in making this relationship work, trying to take it to another level and marrying her but...comes maniac John Geiger, a computer expert who takes control of the ship they're in and complicates the situtation for everyone involved. As usual with the franchise, it's all about revenge on a system, yadda yadda...

I won't deny that there was good action sequences or intense/dramatic ones that made me care for the film - like the deaf girl trapped in the elevator (a recycle from the first film but this time with lots of water involved and she was alone waiting for her hero to come). But 1997 was the year of ""Titanic"" and if a film couldn't reach a similar spectacle we couldn't care less (20th Century Fox produced both on the same year, by the way). I was annoyed, tired, hardly ever impresssed with this mockery of a film. Hollywood gave too much credit and confidence to a lucky cinematographer who had an excellent resume as DP, made two successful films as director and then came this disaster and that is Jan De Bont. His career after this thing? The lousy ""The Haunting"" and the okay second Lara Croft film that sort of like ended the franchise...revived recently with a reboot. ""Speed 2"" is so bad that it's not even fair or interesting enough to pinpoint its countless plot holes, its rushed ending or the lack of more substantial material. A movie like this shouldn't exist, even if the studio is low in box-office - but they weren't as James Cameron's epic proved.

It was a boring waste of time...and in my case I repeated the dose - because I'm a helpless guy who likes to give second chances to movies and many times I've changed my views and end up loving a film after a second view. This and that unofficial 007 film with Connery in the 1980's are the tragic sins that I vow to never watch again. Not even if they pay me. As for acting, Bullock mantains the qualities and quirkness of Annie (nice as usual); Patric is cool but he's not intense or fast as Keanu was; Dafoe makes again a great villain; the helpful folks from the ship, played by Temuera Morrison and Brian McCardie, are some of the good reasons to take a look at this dreadful experience. They were really good and effective in their jobs, I won't say anything bad about them. Highlight of the film is seeing Carlinhos Brown singing his mega-hit ""A Namorada"" and no one explained to me how the hell he actually managed to get off the boat. Maybe some stop before the final destination...but I don't recall seeing that. What I do recall is that this movie was terribly bad when I was younger and it's still the same aching pain in my head after all these years. Never again because that joke isn't funny anymore. 3/10"
3881,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Speed is one of my favorite action films. However, I'd prefer to pretend the sequel doesn't exist. Despite being called Speed 2 Cruise Control the sequel takes place on a slow-moving cruise ship programmed to crash into an oil tanker. Sandra Bullock returns but Keanu Reeves sensibly declined, leaving an actor even more wooden than him to take over. This redefines bad action movies. The truth is, a 3 hour movie featuring a group of robots crawling in circles repeatedly around a muddy field chasing snails would be at least 10 times more exciting than this dreary, desperately atrocious snooze- fest. If you're confused as to whether you're watching a film or having your soul sucked out by a Dementor, I wouldn't be surprised. The visual effects are impressive, but the action is virtually non- existent, the acting is atrocious, the script is below the bottom of the barrel and for an action movie it's all just so boring. Even though the director of Speed returns, he was clearly a one-hit wonder. Basically, go watch a computer simulation of a ship sinking and you've seen Speed 2, so save some time and do that.

But as talented as Sandra Bullock is not even she could have saved this film.

It follows the same formula as Speed did however this time the film take places on a cruise ship. Now whoever thought this was a good idea is clearly a king of fools.

Willem Dafoe as John Geiger, the main antagonist in the film is just how could I put it? Not as smart or dangerous as Howard was in the last film.

Speed 2 clearly was made to try and make a few bucks. While Sandra is a wonderful actress and Willem play a twisted character it just hard to find anything worth wild about this film.

The acting is pretty much forced not one single out performance in this film. Very bored plot idea and the music is so so in the film.

Perhaps the best thing about Speed 2 is that you can keep it all together and not feel guilty about it

He convinces her to go on a cruise to work out their relationship. John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) is a disgruntle employee who uses his computer skills and inside knowledge to hijack the ship sending it into danger. He forces the passengers to abandon ship. Not everybody gets out as deaf girl Drew is trapped in the elevator. Alex decides to stay behind when he suspects foul play.

It's really bad that Jack doesn't return. It's like a Die Hard movie without John McClane. Honestly, if they can't get Keanu Reeves back, I rather have Sandra Bullock save the day by herself. The movie never recovers from it. The first Speed is a manufactured plot but the writing is so good that it never felt fake. This is the exact opposite. Every move in the story feels fake. The first one pulls the audience right in. This one never does. The final boat crash has tons of destruction but it's played almost exclusively for laughs. It feels more like a spoof.

3886,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Speed 2: Cruise Control earns its spot as one of the worst sequels of all time, right amongst such ill fated sequels including but not limited to Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), Jaws: The Revenge (1987), Rocky V (1990), Robocop 3 (1993), Batman and Robin (1997), Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997), and A Good Day to Die Hard (2013). Riding from the success of the 1994 action blockbuster Speed, the question on everybody's lips were: ""When is there going to be a Speed 2?"" The answer, the box office bomb Speed 2: Cruise Control which was a critical and commercial failure.

Keanu Reeves wisely passed on the sequel which turned out to be an excellent career move. Sandra Bullock returns in her role as Annie from the first movie. This time her new boyfriend Alex Shaw (Jason Patric) is also an LAPD SWAT officer who is also a thrill seeking motorbike riding daredevil, but has opted to keep his career a secret from Annie, instead telling her he is a beach patrol officer. Alex has bought 2 tickets for him and Annie to go on a Caribbean cruise aboard the Seabourn Legend. Unfortunately for Alex and Annie, the Seabourn Legend has been taken over by a disgruntled computer engineer John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) who has sabotaged the ship as revenge against the company which terminated him when he became ill as well as stealing the diamonds on board the ship. Annie and Alex, who have been caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time, must stop Geiger from successfully executing his plan as well as save the passengers on board the ship.

Unlike the fast moving action blockbuster Speed, Speed 2 is absolute nonsense that just milked from the success of Speed. The excitement level is minimal compared to the first movie and it lacks all the thrills from the first movie. The stunts are unrealistic and the action sequences are of a below average standard. The dialogue including many of the one liners are also pathetic. I've noticed that the violence had been watered down and bubble gum action has been substituted.

Jason Patric is a poor substitute for Keanu Reeves as the lead hero. He was just lame. Sandra Bullock had more character in the first movie, here she is screechingly irritating. I don't blame her in the slightest for her later admissions of regretting to return to this dud of a sequel. Willem Dafoe is the only redeeming feature of the movie as the main villain Geiger. He chews up every scene he is in and he saves this movie from being a complete dud. Speed 2 has harmed Jan DeBont's career as a director and since then he has followed up with the box office flops The Haunting (1999), and Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (2003). Since then he has disappeared off the radar.

It's no surprise that Speed 2: Cruise Control has the dishonour of making every list featuring the worst sequels in history. I don't blame fans of the first Speed who would rather banish Speed 2: Cruise Control from their memory and treat it like it never existed.

If you want an exciting action movie, stick with the first Speed. Speed 2: Cruise Control is a disappointing movie that sinks to the bottom of the ocean.

Wow, this film along with Batman and Robin were perhaps the worst received big-budget sequels of the past decade. Critics were mostly mixed over Speed 2, but audiences mostly panned it from left to right. This is a surprise: the audiences actually hate a summer movie far more than the critics did. Do I agree? While I do say that this is an extremely unnecessary sequel and that it does take quite a while to get moving, when the action starts there's enough all-out carnage and disaster sequences to keep it entertaining enough to watch, despite the lame story.

As a sequel, Speed 2: Cruise Control's link to its predecessor is tenuous at best. Something tells me its reception would have been warmer had it decided to cut off its connection with the much loved original. Sandra Bullock is pretty much the only similarity the two films have, as well as some crises involving vehicles, though of considerably different sizes. As to where the first film involved a bus, this one's a cruise, and a big one at that.

The movie begins with Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) and Alex Shaw (Jason Patric) heading on a cruise for a vacation of sun and fun. Unfortunately, there's a computer terroist on board, John Geiger (Willem Dafoe), who has a plan to hijack the ship and steal its jewels without anybody knowing. He plants devices all over the ship, causing havoc and it leads the crew to falsely believe there are fires on the ship, thus they must evacuate.

As Geiger's plan unfolds, Shaw begins to realize Geiger is the one behind this and searches for him. He then discovers Geiger's purpose, which is to ram the ship into an oil tanker. With time running out, Shaw must find a way to veer the ship off its disastrous course.

Speed 2 begins fairly slowly and it takes awhile to build up momentum. The first few action scenes aren't particularly good, but some excitement is created when the crew discovers the ship's final destination. So, for the last 45 minutes director Jan De Bont stages some well-executed action sequences (actually, it's pretty much non-stop in those lost 45 minutes) that rival the original in its pacing and outdoes it in size and scope. De Bont basically tries to outdo himself. In the original, a bus ran into a pile of cars. In this film, a cruise rams into the port of a small town, destroying virtually everything in its path. In the first movie, the bus explodes in grand fashion. In this one, an oil tanker blows up in an even larger explosion. With all this sound and fury, there's just something missing here: the sense of frantic urgency due to the characters.

Admittedly, in technical terms, the pacing is frenetic, but you don't particularly care for any of the characters all that much. This new cast isn't likeable or developed well enough to elicit any real sympathy, unlike the passengers aboard the bus in the original. The people whom we get to liking the most are a deaf girl and the second mate, but neither are given a chance to really make much of an impression other than be part of the visual spectacle.

As I stated earlier, De Bont hasn't lost his flair for action scenes, but he needs a much better script to work with. The plot's hardly worth mentioning and the dialogue isn't much better. The worst must be when Annie escapes the grasps of Geiger, who starts shouting, ""Come back! You're supposed to be my hostage!"" Dear Lord, it's hard to imagine anyone writing that without some self-parody in mind.

The acting is serviceable. Jason Patric makes a fairly effective action hero when it comes to the physical work. He just doesn't exude the charisma Keanu Reeves had. He also takes the film far too seriously. Sandra Bullock isn't that different from her previous performance as Annie Porter. She's still the feisty, fun-loving girl who's out to have a good time. She's okay in her role, but there's no chemistry between her and Patric. Maybe it would have worked had the two been complete strangers on the cruise. Willem Dafoe is quite bad as the villain. He's among my favorite actors and it's a pain to see him relegated to a role this weak. Basically, all he has to do is look menacing once in a while, and incompetent as well, which seems required out of movie villains in big summer blockbusters.

It seems by now that the movie is considered a dud by virtually everyone. Even actress Sandra Bullock has disowned it (though, methinks this had more to do with audience reaction and the box office numbers). Still, there's enough visual spectacle to keep undemanding action fans satisfied. The script is a true dud and the movie as a whole is still only middling at best, but at least the film acknowledges it's nothing great."

3899,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Even though some people are still captivated by movies filled with action, but without any respectful plot -and they´re perfectly entitled to like whatever they want- I think Hollywood finally heard the majority of people´s criticism for going for the money without a serious attempt to produce a serious quality movie.

That´s probably when they decided to get smart and began casting at least a recognized and proven star for their entertaining but mindless movies. Just like ""CON AIR"" and ""AIR FORCE ONE"" needed the help of John Malcovich and Glenn Close respectively, SPEED 2 needed the mercenary-like help of star William Dafoe.

I don´t question Dafoe´s motives to enrol in this kind of cheesy project -I would also put up with some embarrassment for the alleged millions he cashed in with this movie- nor I question the producers for signing up a designated hitter to give the movie some credibility. What I do question is the taste and self esteem of those people older than 25 who really, really, really believe this movie had anything good in it. Hey! I still respect their opinion, but I certainly would tell my sister not to date them.

Sandra Bullock is charming. True. Did that make her do well in this film? I don´t think so. She´s right to regret taking part in this sorrowful affair. The boat? the speed? the coincidences? Please! There are far better ways to defy common sense and make the viewer realize he/she is just being entertained, not necessarily by insulting his/her intelligence.

William DaFoe...don´t feel bad! I would´ve done the same. Keep laughing behind closed doors! Other stars are doing it, why not you?"
3900,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,I thought that this film was a well directed film but it was a typical movie. I also thought it was a good film because of the setting. The tropical setting makes this movie enjoyable. Sandra bullock and William and Jason patric and others played very good roles in this movie. If Keanu Reeves was in this film it would be slightly different but not enirely. But Jason's acting was entertaining. There is something about William that makes his evil roles in some way make you want to see him acting whether it doing something of evil matter or whatever. If I were directing this movie I would extend it significantly. The only downsides to this film is the duration the typicalness of the film and

3905,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"""Speed"" was a surprise hit movie. While it cost about $30,000,000 to make, it made back more than four times the cost. So, some Hollywood executives (with a collective IQ similar to that of a gerbil) thought...'if we do a sequel, we must spend $120,000,000 on it because THAT is why the first movie was such a success'. Not surprisingly, the movie tanked and it somehow has made it to IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list--the 100 worst ranked major releases of all time.

In the original, Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock work to prevent a bus from exploding and killing folks. Now, because this is an overbloated sequel, they've placed the story aboard a cruise ship...which is also out of control and will kill everyone unless our heroes save it....though this time Reeves refused to reprise his role. So, they cast the rather bland Jason Patric in the lead...who offered little improvement other than he was very good at using sign language in one small scene.

How bad is this film? Well, not bad enough to be on the Bottom 100 list. So why is it on the list? After loving the first film, so many folks expected more of the same...and got nothing but a dull overblown action picture with little in the way to interest viewers....and I think THAT is why it made the list....because it disappointed so badly. Instead, I wish IMDB had a list for films with the worst ratio of cost to enjoyability of the film...in which case ""Speed 2"" would easily make the top 100.

By the way, this sequel ended up spending nearly as much for ONE crash scene as the budget for all of ""Speed""! And, after paying $11,500,000 just to obtain Sandra Bullock for this film, you can only assume that the film simply had nothing left to pay competent writers. Instead, I assume, they hired some penguins to write the script....some very, very dull and untalented penguins!"

3909,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Speed 2, in my opinion is probably the worst sequel to a film I've ever seen. Everyone should of passed on this. This lacks so much so many qualities and attributes that the first didn't. There's no terror and suspense at all, even though we know this ship is on a collision course. Most of the film is shot in dark too. Mad hacker John Geiger (Dafoe) who's looked better, has hacked into the control system on this cruise ship, that just so happens to have the annoying Bullock on board with her new Beau (Patric, totally wasted) sending it on a course with death, if he doesn't get his ransom of moolah. Geiger isn't fearing death either, as he is dying from a cancer, his pet worms his real only friends, and also a cure for his pain. Dafoe goes all out with his character, showing us why he's one of those special great character acting talents, where Patric almost looks as though he did out this of desperation for work. When the cruise ship smashes into that makeshift harbor and condos near the end, that part is good for two reasons. 1, it looks really cool, as we wonder where the liner's actually stop, and 2, it's the end. Thank god it's the end of this franchise, but then again, you don't really know what the future holds."
3910,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"The problem with being a sequel is that you have to live up to the original. Nowadays, this isn't much of a problem because hit movies are easily predicted, and the masses flock to the best advertised ones like sheep. But ""Speed"" was an unexpected success story, and because it made a lot of money, a sequel was put into the works. The result was a film that was vilified by the critics and public alike.

I'm honestly surprised that the reviews of ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" are so vicious. While I won't deny that the original is better (a LOT better), the sequel isn't as bad as some people make it out to be. It contains its share of flaws, but it does a lot of things right.

After the events of the original, Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) is liking the peaceful life. She has a new boyfriend, Alex (Jason Patric), and he surprises her with a week-long cruise. Someone should have warned him about her propensity for disasters (and NOT just because she's a bad driver). Also on the cruise is John Geiger (Willem Dafoe), a psychotic computer genius with an ax to grind. Shortly after the couple gets on board, Geiger takes over the ship and sets it on a course for disaster.

The film's biggest mistake was doing casting Jason Patric as Alex. Keanu Reeves turned down the role to tour with his band, but judging by his performance, they should have offered Reeves more money, or gotten someone else. Patric is awful. His performance is so wooden it makes Reeves, who is not a versatile actor either, look good. At least Sandra Bullock is back as Annie. Annie is adorable as always, and she is used to this sort of thing, so she gets to give a few one-liners, which are pretty funny. As Geiger, Willem Dafoe is great. He's creepy, and not just because he puts leeches on himself. Dafoe is so good that he gives Dennis Hopper a run for his money. Rounding out the cast are Temura Morrison, Brian McCardie, and Royale Watkins.

Director Jan de Bont has a lot of fun with this movie, and it shows. He doesn't take this sequel as seriously as the first, so there are a lot more one-liners and jokes. But he still manages to get some thrills packed in the movie, and that's the important thing. One thing I didn't like is that he used slow-motion too much, and in some scenes he has a tendency to move the camera a lot.

""Speed 2"" is not as good as the first movie, but it's still fun!"

It's called Speed 2: Cruise Control. And that's what it was. This time, instead of a bus, they're on a ship, and this is where the action takes place. The ship travels at a controlled pace. You know. At cruise control. Sandra Bullock has returned for the sequel, and she plays the character Annie Porter just like in the first movie. Speed 2 is definitely not anywhere near as good as Speed, but it's still watchable. In this movie, Annie Porter goes on a vacation with Alex Shaw, a police officer, to the Caribbean on a cruise ship. The problem is that the cruise ship they're boarding on has been taken over by a man called John Geiger who has bad intentions. He wasn't suppose to take control of the ship. Speed 2 wasn't too bad. It still had Sandra Bullock from the first movie, and it also had a excellent villain in Willem Dafoe. He played John Geiger. I think it was these two that made Speed 2 good to watch. I think people are being quite unfair regarding this movie. I don't think Speed and Speed 2 should be compared. They're both different movies. Speed is very fast; Speed 2 is very slow. I didn't mind.

The story: a cruiseboat gets hijacked by a terrorist (Willem Dafoe).

The good: only 1 part (lasting just about 5 minutes) of the ship wrecking a small harbor town is actually still good fun to watch, because it is done without any form of CGI. It's at 1 hour and 41 minutes, not one minute earlier, that you get to see a big boat eat up a harbor town's buildings.

The bad: terrible, TERRIBLE script, with idiotic plot turns and cheesy dialogues and unbelievable characters. It would have been a B-movie were it not for the massive amount of money they put into this sequel, which was a huge flop at the box office for a good reason: it was lousy, really lousy and believe me I like to watch a B-movie now and then, but this sequel hits a new bottom for sequels...

Yeah, they actually do that. The action starts out in Los Angeles, so naturally you assume they're going to sail from POLA. But NOOO. Without another word, they're taken on as passengers by an annoying crewman and they sail off into the sunset. So it looks like they'll go around Cuba, make a stop at Guantanamo, wave at Castro... but no. Willem Dafoe has chartered a plane in Saint Maarten and left it waiting for anyone to steal it, in order to come on to the Seaboard Ledger with a ton of computer equipment, explosives, golf clubs, uniforms -- but nothing to comb his hair.

Hilarity ensues as Jack, I mean Alex and Annie get hammered. Eventually everyone changes the channel to see if there's anyone on the QVC network hawking multi-million dollar diamond jewelry sets. Willem Dafoe gets all sparkly eyed and immediately we figure he's there to pull a heist. So far he's spent half a million dollars to steal a couple million of overpriced paste. Boy is he going to be pissed when he finds out he's in a horrible sequel.

Let's look at the ""right"" it does:

ONE VILLAIN. Just like Speed, but also like Dirty Harry, Alien and Predator, it focuses on a SINGLE villain. That is a great idea. No faceless target villains thrown in for some cheap action, focus on one.

BIG CHANGES WHEN MAKING A SEQUEL: Bigger, but also different! It worked for Aliens, Die Hard 2 and Predator 2!

IMPRESSIVE SPECIAL EFFECTS: This movie has spectacular specials! I had to wonder how much was real and how much was models.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT VILLAINS TO GET ACTION: In much of the action, the heroes are fighting the environment and not the villain.

COMIC SIDEKICKS: There are some characters that clearly are intended to be funny. (No, they were not very funny but they tried... a bit.)

SAVE THE KIDS: We care about kids. Just think about Aliens. (That is part of why we hated when Newt was written out of Alien 3. We loved to see her making it.) This is clearly included here, and the deaf girl idea is pretty nice.

This doesn't look like a bad sequel at all, not on paper. Obviously it went wrong, it flopped. Why? I think it is bad timing, uninteresting dialogue, uninteresting romantic side story, weak directing... So all the good things just weren't assembled to a great whole.

But I can list a couple of much, much worse action movies with much better ratings, movies that left me with a stronger feeling of wasted time and dull plot, B- movies on AAA budget, just like this.

So did I waste my time? Well, I certainly could have watched a better movie, but it was not a rating 1 movie. Just another dull popcorn movie. A typical movie for a rating at 4-6 somewhere."

3928,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"I first saw SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL at the cinema. I was at the tender age of 16, and I thought it was great: action-packed, with great effects and a fun, DIE HARD-style storyline. Well, it still has all those things, but time has not been kind to SPEED 2, and watching as an adult I can see just how poor it is.

The problem with the film is the infantile nature of the script, which sounds as if it's been deliberately written for children. Jason Patric's clunky leading man I can forgive, but the supporting characters and their lame comedy are excruciating. The porter and the Scottish guy are bad enough, but Sandra Bullock takes the biscuit with her repetitive attempts at light humour. If ever a film made you despise someone, it's Bullock in this.

Otherwise, the story suffers from a little bloating and an ending that goes on way too long, but it does have some stuff to recommend it. The low rent action-man hijinks are a hoot, and Willem Dafoe is fantastic as the over-the-top villain, all teeth and hair and as crazy as he was in WILD AT HEART. The effects hold up pretty well, too.

A shame, then, about the child-friendly nature of the production; had this been a proper, adult-focused outing along the lines of UNDER SIEGE it could have been a damn sight better."

3930,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"It was a poor choice among many to even entertain this sequel. If you were anything like me when this film released, a die-hard fan of the original, sure, you had some expectations, but you went in open-mindedly expecting something grand. Same director, Sandra Bullock? They must have figured out how to make this good without Keanu.

But you were young then and this was your first lesson about the cautions one must take where sequels are concerned. Some stories just need to be left told. When they chose to replace the star character with another (played by an actor who was unintentionally and so incredibly upstaged by Sandra Bullock); when they replaced a speeding bus with a BOAT, completely undermining the whole concept, further adding insult to the title's singled-worded zinger...suspicions should have been raised. Maybe then this sadly disappointing flop wouldn't have stung so much.

Fortunately, after the hurt subsided, you realized the movie was so incredibly estranged from the original in almost every possible way, that you'd subconsciously come to regard it as it's own entirely separate film. And you've moved on happily regarding 'Speed' as ONE of the greatest action flicks of its time. And that other film with a similar title is completely forgotten save for the part about you having seen it once.

But I say, if you haven't seen it already, save yourself the emotional steps it will take to find happiness again and just give the first one another watch. I find I enjoy it every time."

3932,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Speed 2 is a dull thriller with little to recommend apart from a few nifty special effects. Sandra Bullock is game for the role but the terrible script leaves her without any support. Jason Patric, a replacement for Keanu Reeves has very little charisma and practically no chemistry with Bullock. The film is silly and is best enjoyed with one hand on the FF button along with a group of friends. It shouldn't take too much time to skip to the action scenes which are the sole saving grace of the film. As a sequel to the well crafted thriller Speed, Speed 2 is a massive letdown.

3940,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Ships are designed to be evacuated very quickly. Lifeboats can be launched at up to 35 degrees list and at a speed of 4-5 knots. Same with life rafts.

Also, according to regulations, lifeboats have a 10% additional capacity compared to the marked one. On Carnival's Paradise, the 150 person lifeboats are capable of holding 165.

Now, my tape fell and broke, but I remember some parts that just killed me! Propellers can't just STOP like nothing. They have to wind down or wind up to prevent shaft twisting. Ships do NOT just start moving at 20 knots. The biggest ones if they really crank up the engine can surprise you but it'll still take a bit to get up to 5 knots or from 5 knots to 0. Giuliano could have effected a much better lifeboat boarding and gotten everyone off. I doubt very much that your average cabin has the vital communications to the engine room going through it. Aside from that, the computer systems controlling everything and being lockable isn't exactly true from my experience. Most ships have an electronic wheel. There are also usually dual tillers that override autopilot automatically, and use separate control lines.

Then you have the engine Control Room, which is usually separated a bit more from the engines. All fire doors can be remotely controlled but they all have emergency handles on both sides. How do you expect the fire teams to put the fire out if they cannot enter? Bow thrusters have controls but NOT HAND WHEELS!

During the end he stops one of the screws, if memory serves. He might have failed but I cannot remember. If he did the ship would have gone way off course unless they did some fancy rudder compensation.

AND THAT SHIP'S WHEEL! IT IS AN ELECTRONIC WHEEL! THEY DO NOT HAVE FEEDBACK! The wheel does not lock up or anything. If the ship is on autopilot, the wheel will not do anything unless you switch off. There is no wheel brake stopping it from turning. If it is active, the wheel will turn with no feedback except from the spring loading to bring it back to midships unless held in place. It will not turn the rudders if on autopilot. Oh well. Your dumb photographer would be turning 35 degrees to each side with his holding on."

3945,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"My God. How bad does it become when there is more tension on a bus than a 30000+ tonne cruise liner.

From the very beginning of the film I thought to myself that Sandra Bullock deserved to suffer more than the bad guy being pursued in the truck. He was after all probably just trying to feed his family. What kind of retarded individual acts in such a behaviour when she is taking her driving test as Ms Bullock.

Surely that was worthy of an arrest in itself.

Next we move on to a cruise ship where supposedly Bullock and Patric are taking a vacation so that the two can work their problems out and get to know each other better. Throughout the rest of the movie God only knows why Patric didn't throw Bullock overboard for the simple reason as to get her to shut the hell up.

The film could have been some what better had they not billed it as a sequel to Speed. Take away Bullock and the numerous plot holes and there is just a hint (and I meen a hint) of an OK action movie. When I say plot holes, I of course use examples such as turning a ship to avoid an oil tanker that turns enough to avoid the head on collision and then fails to keep turning. People flying through glass windows when the ship slows by a knot. Crashing into yaughts and pedaloes which help the ship slow down enormously. That kind of thing.

I am personally a big action film fan and am normally very happy to shut my mind down and watch great scenes that involve explosions, special fx and mindless killing but not even I could oversee the disasterous attempt that this film produced.

Avoid if at all possible."
3946,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"I've just had the unfortunate mispleasure of sitting through Speed II and it really is as bad as they say.

The biggest disappointment of all is Willem Dafoe: always been a huge fan and felt he's been understretched, but it's hard to imagine him doing this for anything other than money. A tightly-written character study it ain't.

The only good thing I can say about it is I thought the CGI was very well done - often it can look a bit plastic, but it was slick as oil here. (hah!) Still, with $100+ million dollars thrown at it there'd have been a public enquiry if it hadn't looked good.

'Speed' is far superior, and whilst essentially a silly movie at least that had charm. The performances here are faxed in and there are no surprises. If Jason Patric could be any more wooden he'd need varnishing.

True Story: I was supposed to go out and not see the film at all but my friend had an eye infection which meant he had to sit in an unlit room with his eyes closed. So I watched Speed II instead. And I actually envied his inability to see. 'Nuff said."

Speed 2 is a disaster by the numbers... bad acting, bad writing, and bad script (talking Power Rangers suck-arse-dom). What we have here is a heartbreaking story about a zany cybernut (Dafoe) on a warpath to insanity because of some injustice or whatever done to him in his former sane life. He hijacks a cruise liner filled with comical cannon fodder, so that he may acquire some invaluable diamonds for his evil schemes (???). On the good guys side, we have token black guy, moronic crew, bad acting LAPD cop-person (Patric) no one's going to ever hear from again, and Sandra Bullock on her worst day... all of whom are equally worthless in this script. There's really no development or story which is sort of hilarious. All we get are Dafoe's wacky and zany antics and LAPD cop-person pretending to be smart and clever while Bullock whines and grunts every now and then as a reminder that there are other important cast members in this monstrosity. What garbage. But hey, there were plenty of EXPLOSIONS on both badly done and well done sets so I guess it wasn't a total loss, right? LOL.

Sandra's acting was wonderful as always. I thought she saved what could have been a pretty bad script. The girl has charisma. :)

First of all I was not happy with the lighting throughout a majority of the film. My friends and I could not see what was going on! That really bothered me.

Secondly, the movie was really slow. Were the first speed took off - this one lagged. It didn't seem to get into the action until a good 40 minutes into the film. The suspense. The thrill. Where did it go? It must still be on the bus.....

The story line is totally unbelievable, full of cliches, the characters got NO depth whatsoever, and it's just plain boring. The action scenes is unrealistic to the point of despair. I must admit though, some times I laughed(!); but alas - it was because of the totally incoherent plot which seems just as convincing as the plot of a porn movie.

Why Ms. Bullock signed up on this one is beyond me. She's totally wasted in the movie. Patric, oh well, it's unfair to judge his acting capabilities based on this one, BUT he's just as forgettable as the cast in a shaving-cream commercial.

This sequel may have lots of explosions and the pace rarely flags for a minute, but to have the wondrous Sandra Bullock be completely wasted for the duration is a crime.

On the plus side, Jason Patric is a good choice of hero but Willem Dafoe was actually less terrifying than Wile Coyote.

For instance, the navigator (Scottish accent) isn't consistent, the first officer seems to be a little lacking in his knowledge of his ship, except for the part where he brilliantly leads our hero through the bowels of the ship via the PA, and knowing perfectly where they are, even though he's technically 'blind'. You can even hear him when they go underwater. Never did the equipment short out due to seawater.

Perhaps I'm spoiled by the fact that after seeing Titanic any movie about a sinking ship becomes stale, but this one just takes the cake when it comes to the most fake looking condos as well as ship. Frankly I started founding myself laughing as the ship keeps on meeting disasters after disast"
3977,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"What was the point of making this movie? SPEED on a boat? Come on! Stupid! I don't know why this movie was made. Speed is one of those movies that didn't need a sequel. There was really no reason to make a second one, and calling it Speed was a dumb idea. They should have called it float or cruise. If you plan on buying Speed 2, do yourself a favour and buy the original. And if you have the original, save your money. I give this movie two very enthusiastic thumbs d"
3978,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Why did they have to do this. Speed was an unforgettably great movie that everyone loved. But then they make this junk! This movie is nothing like it's original. Sure it's exciting and entertaining, but it does't have the right tone. If I'm not mistaken, it's almost as if they are trying to make a comedy out of this movie. The humor they put into it during the should-be suspenseful scenes makes this movie horrible. It was going in the right direction, but they blew it with that leech scene. To make up for this, they ought to make another speed movie, and this time, they should have a million times more suspense an action, and less hu"
3979,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"A great movie with a little bit of everything in it. Some suspense, some laughs and great cast. Sandra Bullock did a great job in this movie. Without her the movie wouldn't be as good. She makes it good! Watch it, its worth it! I recommend this to everyone! Excellent mo"

3986,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"It amazes me how Hollywood producers could not be smart enough to figure out that this film would be a dud. It should have been called Speed 2:Hokie Pokie. It was like a bad Bond film - with goofy prats and gratuitous gags. If I was Jan de Bont, I'd be ashamed to have my name on this film. (Then again - he did do Lethal Weapon3) Dramatic action could have been directed in such a way that it would have been suspenseful. A ship crashing into an oil tanker is believable, but two guys who had to swim across the entire length of a ship to get to open some valves is reasonable. Then, they just pop right up on deck without swimming back? he could have learned something by watching inferno...Who tied his hands and put all that cheesy crap in? Fiction is supposed to suspend disbelief. Every scene has something that is unbelievable. This movie cannot take itself seriously. You can find better ways to spend two hours of your life, like rearranging you sock dra"
3987,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"So ill-conceived from the very first frame: the sour sequel begins with a standard chase involving the hero (Patric) on a motorcycle. For some reason, the back of the van he's chasing opens by accident and various objects come spilling out, so he has to avoid them, as if in some primitive video game. Why is all this happening? We don't know, we don't care. Then things really slow to a crawl on a cruise ship, on which our returning heroine, Bullock, and her new beau (Patric) embark to avoid a break-up - will the thrills never stop, er, begin? Enter the villain, Dafoe, terminally ill and with a fondness for leeches. If you're in the mood to just relax and enjoy the Bullock personality out at sea, then maybe this movie's for you, but this was not the reason this picture was made. No, it was to provide spills, thrills and chills! What we get, mostly, is a lot of confusing action on the big boat, much of which takes place in darkness after the villain sabotages everything. Patric appears uncomfortable in many of his scenes; Keanu Reeves passed on this movie, a canny move seems like, and a search was on for his replacement. Hm, so who do they select - an actor known for his moody character roles in edgy dramas; sure, he'll do! A sign of how bad this gets: the more interesting point for me was spotting a passenger who also had a small role in the elevator scene from the previous ""Speed."" Plummer also returns, in a wildly improbable turn of events, and manages to be somewhat entertaining - a sad comment on everyone else. Finally, we have the climactic $25 million wreckage scene; it's slow going like everything else. The final nail in the coffin of this pic? It came out just before ""Titanic."" No way would there be two successful big boat pictures in the same year."
3988,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Throughout my entire life, I've always been optimistic about sequels because there are some that are really well. I remember when this movie opened in June 1997 thinking ""why did they make a sequel to a great action film?"" For years, I had shyed away from seeing this movie(mainly because I wasn't interested) and now, 8 years later I finally decided to watch it. My one line summary of ""Speed 2"" basically summarizes everything I want to say. That is, this film is a great example as to why MOST sequels should not be greenlit. ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" has everything you love to hate about a movie or a sequel in general: bad acting, paper thin plot and a terrible script. Jason Patric(in place of the more charismatic Keanu Reeves) is the hero this time around and does not live up to what an action hero should be. Sandra Bullock, this time around does not come off as cute or charming but rather annoying in this bland sequel.

If I had to really think, I would probably say Willem Dafoe is the only good thing about this movie but even he is terrible as the film's main villain itself. I think the main problem with ""Speed 2"" is that it severely lacked the charisma the first ""Speed"" had. Overall, I hope the producers learned their lesson with this one. By the way, who's ""genius"" idea(sarcastically) was it to rate this film ""PG-13?"" In the end ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" was a lame attempt at cashing in on the success of the first film but ultimately fails in doing this."
3989,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"I really wanted to vote this movie a 0, but 1 was the lowest I could go. Sandra Bullock should be banned from acting after this one. Keanu did a good job by avoiding it. The only one that has an excuse for being in this movie it is the cute little dog, and he didn't have a choice in the matter. I can't begin to describe how bad this movie is, bad writing, worse directing, terrible acting. If anyone can think anything in this movie is even remotely believable,(yes, even by movie standards,) I'll sell them a cheap ticket to Bikini Bottom so they can go meet Spongebob Squarepants, which is where this movie should be, on the ocean floor. I'm ashamed of myself and have put myself on double secret probation for having watched it. If I ever watch another movie this bad I'll put my own eyes "

3991,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"This movie is beyond terrible. It is the polar opposite of it's counterpart and bigger brother SPEED. It's sort of like the movie Twins. SPEED is Arnold's character, the guy who gets all the good traits, and Speed2 is Danny DeVito's character, the guy who gets all the bad traits. SPEED is the best movie ever, Speed2 is the worst movie ever. SPEED has everything, from Jeff Daniels to Dennis Hopper to Keanu Reeves. Speed2 has the leftovers, second rate actors like Jason Patric and Sandra Bullock. Wait, I take that back, Speed2 has second rate actors like Jason Patric and William DaFoe. SPEED has an exploding BUS, Speed2 has a stupid boat. SPEED set the bar for edge of your seat live action, Speed2 set the bar for worst sequels ever. SPEED won Oscars, Speed2 won Razzies.

There are a few changes that would make Speed2 an awesome movie. The first is to replace Jason Patric's character with Keanu Reeves. Next you replace the boat with a bus. You then move the location from the Carribean to Los Angeles. Next you have to change the bad guy from William DaFoe to Dennis Hopper. You have to give Keanu a partner to shoot in Jeff Daniels. And finally, you have to make the intent of the villain to blow up the bus if it drops below 50mph unless he gets $3 million dollars. Only then would Speed2 be a good movie."
3992,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"I do not like Sandra Bullock's movies, generally speaking. But I did like this one! I recommend, however, that you seriously suspend ALL disbelief when watching this. There are MANY occasions where the characters do something that adds to the suspense of the movie, but YOU could come up with a much easier solution that would have solved the problem 30 minutes ago. OK, it's stupid in places. But, it's colorful, fun and suspenseful without being heavyweight. Sit back, enjoy, and make fun of how stupid the characters are. "
3993,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Seeing the previews and whatnot for Speed 2, I knew that if Keanu Reeves (who is in a way,underrated) wasn't participating in this, what point would there be for me to see it. Having missed it in theatre I decided to take a chance and see this on video. Knowing that I saw this at all is regrettable. It is somehow one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and certainly one of the worst of the last ten years. Sandra Bullock, Willem Dafoe, and especially Jason Patric have to take a look at themselves and ask what was in it for them-- besides the money?

A complete waste of time, money, energy,etc., etc.,"
3994,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"As an old AB sailor I hereby come to the conclusion that this is the worst film I have ever seen! Please mr. director - get your ridiculous facts right!

First, you don´t stop a full speeding cruiser weighing 30.000 deadweight tonnes by dropping an anchor... Neither does it take 15 seconds to pull hundreds of meters of anchor chain out of the water, more likely 45 minutes... Furthermore, it is impossible to hold a mooring rope under hard pulling force with only one turn on the nock... Also, trying to stop a revolving 18 tonne propeller under the influence of an 25-30.000 horsepower machine is like stopping a runaway train with a shoestring... Last, since there will be no air to breath within 10-15 seconds after a haloon system is set of, you can only launch it, after a long alarm, from a separate location.... Thanks for nothing mr. direc"
3995,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Speed was an awesome movie, and an exciting, original concept, IMO. Let's face it, it was pretty hard to follow with a sequel. Added to that the fact that you didn't have the majour hero star, well, it was pretty impossible. Yet, the producers decided to soldier on. They got a new hero, and Sandra Bullock, and they made a go of it. It's not brilliant, but let's face it, I don't think they we're trying to be brilliant. Frankly, I believe that the largest problem with this movie is that it tried to be a sequel to the first movie. Also, it was on water, which had been done to death e.g. The Poseidon Adventure, Under Siege, one of the Airport movies, etc. Strictly as a stand-alone feature, it may've done better without referring to the original. Mind you, maybe it would've been better as a direct-to-video feature. Looking at it strictly by itself, I liked it, but I've been known to like crappy movies in my day. I certainly wouldn't rate it higher than a 5 out of 10. It's no Speed, and it's not even worthy of being a sequel to Speed, but it's got its merits. It's not a compleat piece of crap as some would have you beli"
3996,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"I'm very surprised by the enormity of the negative voting here for Speed 2. I enjoyed the first Speed just as much as everyone, and yet I believe that Speed 2 was a decent sequel. True, without Mr. Reeves it doesn't feel quite the same, but I think Sandra Bullock does an excellent job with a poor script. And Jason Patrick would be a good hero if only people would give him a chance. Willem Defoe is a terrific villain in his role, and overall the movie has more good elements than bad. The fact that it's a sequel to a fantastic movie is what makes it so hard to be objective. I hope more people will realize that Speed 2 is not as bad as they th"
3997,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"The only thing good about this movie was the fact that it wasn't longer. This had it all, fiberglass sail boats exploding, 14 year old deaf girls falling in love with 30 year old dumb men and a computer programmer that gets copper poisioning from the ""electro magnetic field produced by computers"". I think there's certain questions that movie makers need to ask themselves before they make a movie, like ""will this still be a good idea when I'm sober"". That's right folks the answer in this case is ""NO"". This movie had more plot holes than the first one and didn't have the added entertainment of Keanu ""acting"". The best acting was done by the jar of leaches that the mad bomber carries around with him to ""clean his blood"". I'm deeply frightened by the fact that people will think it's believable that a oil freighter can be blown up by an aluminium float plane pontoon.

My faith in humanity is shaken by the fact that there's people that produce movies like this and try to pass it off as entertainment. It was entertaining I will admit, but not for the reasons that the producers intended it to be (I think)."
3998,Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997),3.9,Jan de Bont,"Wow. We know a movie is set to fail when our minds start wandering within 20 minutes. It was the case here. One of the MANY things that made the original work so well is terrific action, good characters and a great bad guy. This does the opposite. Silly action sequences, boring characters, and a dumb bad guy. Rumor has it that Bullock and Patrick did not get along during the filming of this, and they are not good enough actors to hide it.
